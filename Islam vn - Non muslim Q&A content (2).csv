I have heard many Muslims say that dogs are dirty and Satan has spit on them. Also, if we touch a dog, we have to wash our hands several times. I haven't been able to find anything concerning this in the Quran, Hadith, or Islamic books. Please help. Summary of answer If you touch a dog when it is not wet, then your hand does not become impure. If you touch a dog when it is wet, this means that the hand becomes impure and must be washed seven times, one of which should be with earth. Similar Topics Answer Is it haram to keep a dog?

Obligatory Parts of Prayer,"16/Safar/1424 , 18/April/2003 24,665 He is married to his maternal aunt through breastfeeding Question : 13357 Until recently there were concubines in our country, and this issue has come up; I would like to know the shar’i ruling on it. A man had a wife whose name was Aaminah, and he had a concubine whose name was Sa’diyyah. Aaminah (his wife) breastfed a girl called Zaynab, and the slave woman Sa’diyyah had a daughter whose name was Haleemah. The daughter, Haleemah, got married and had a son called ‘Ali, who grew up and married Zaynab, who had been breastfed by Aaminah. They have been married for many years, and have several sons and daughters. My question is, what is the ruling on this marriage? Is it permissible for me not to tell them, if this marriage is not legitimate?. Answer One of the rulings on radaa’ah (breastfeeding) is that the milk of the wet nurse has an effect on the child she breastfeeds and on his or her children. If Zayd was breastfed by Faatimah, then Zayd and his children are regarded as children of the wet nurse (Faatimah), but his brothers are not connected to them through breastfeeding. But for the wet nurse, the bond established by breastfeeding includes all her relatives, so whoever is related to the wet nurse is also related to the child whom she breastfed.

Question : 13359 Did Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever teach people not to eat Fish and Milk together? Summary of answer It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade drinking milk at the same time as eating fish. Similar Topics Answer It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade drinking milk at the same time as eating fish. Since no such thing has been proven, then we should refer to the doctors concerning this issue. If they say that eating these things together is harmful, then they should not be eaten together, rather they should be eaten separately. But if there is no harm in eating them together, then you may do so if you wish. It may be that eating them together is harmful for some people, because of individual sensitivities or allergies, or the nature of their bodies, whilst it is not harmful to others.

Answer The one who is most entitled to lead the prayers is the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allaah and who has most knowledge of the fiqh of prayer and is most keen to ensure that his prayer is correct. That includes doing the essential parts and obligations of the prayer in the required manner. But if he does not do the prayer or one of its essential parts, such as rukoo’, properly, then the matter is subject to further discussion: -If he is unable to stand or bow or prostrate for a valid reason such as sickness etc., then there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. The most correct view is that his leading the prayers is valid because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The people should be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allaah.” This is the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him), as it says in al-Majmoo’, 4/264, and this was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) as was narrated from him in al-Insaaf, 4/374.

Rules of Menstruation,"23/Safar/1424 , 25/April/2003 8,574 His property is for rent – does he have to pay zakaah on it? Question : 13361 If a person has property that he has prepared to rent out, does he have to pay zakaah on this property?. Answer Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is no zakaah on this property, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no zakaah due on the Muslim’s slave or horse.” Rather zakaah is due on the rents, if one hijri year passes from the time of the contract. For example: A man rents out this house for ten thousand, and receives ten thousand after the year is over. He has to pay zakaah on this money, because one year has passed since the contract was signed. Another man rented out his house for ten thousand, five thousand of which is paid at the time of signing the contract, which he spent within two months, and five thousand was to be paid halfway through the year, which he took and spent within two months. When the year ended he did not have anything left of the rent, so no zakaah was due on it, because no full year passed with the money in his possession. In order for zakaah to be obligatory, a full year should pass with it in the person’s possession. Source : Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/208 Have feedback about this content?

Rights of Spouses,"17/Safar/1424 , 19/April/2003 408,202 Can Muslims settle in kaafir countries for the sake of a better life? Question : 13363 I live in a western country, and I can practice my religion without much difficulty, praise be to Allah. I have seen on your site some ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which forbid Muslims to settle in kaafir lands or to live among the kuffaar. I am now confused about whether to go back to my country or to stay in this country, knowing that if I go back to my country, I will encounter hardship and persecution because of my adherence to the laws of Allah, and I will not be able to find freedom of worship such as I enjoy in the country where I live now. I hope that you can answer my question and explain the ruling on my staying in this country, especially since the Muslim countries are no longer very different from others with regard to adherence to the laws of Islam. Answer The basic principle is that it is not permissible for the Muslim to settle among the mushrikeen if he is unable to practice his religion openly while being able to emigrate to a Muslim country. This is indicated by evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): “In what (condition) were you?” They repl...",lifestyle,marriage,"islam, lifestyle, faith",IslamQA.info,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13363/rights-of-spouses,"lifestyle, islamic knowledge",beginner,High,Yes,Q&A,English,,,,2026-01-14,270,1503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is the ruling on one who does Tawaf and Sa’i and does not have wudu? May Allah reward you with good. Summary of answer Your Sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah is valid, even if it was done without wudu because having wudu is not a condition of Sa`i. Similar Topics Answer Your Sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah is valid, even if it was done without wudu because having wudu is not a condition of Sa`i . But your Tawaf al-Wada` was not valid, because one of the conditions of Tawaf is that you should be pure.

About Islam,"No, Hajj and Umrah are not the same thing; they are two different forms of pilgrimage.Hajj is usually referred to as the major pilgrimage or the Pilgrimage, and Umrah as the lesser one.


Both Hajj and Umrah consist of a journey to Makkah that involves certain rituals such as ihram, circumambulating the Ka`bah, walking between the hills of Safa and Marwah, and shaving or cutting the hair.So, What are the differences between Hajj and Umrah?1. Extra rituals



Hajj: Black or White Dots?
The rituals mentioned above are the basic rituals of Umrah. Hajj, on the other hand, has these and additional rituals, including spending days and nights in `Arafah, Mina, and Muzdalifah – areas neighboring the city of Makkah.The rituals of Umrah are limited and can be finished in few hours, that is why it is described as the lesser pilgrimage. Hajj rituals require at least 4 days and 3 nights to complete them.

Is it possible for one of them to commit a sin and disobey their Creator?,"I.
One of the pillars of belief in Allah, may He be Exalted, is believing in the angels who are close to Him.
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appeared before the people one day and Jibril came to him and said: What is faith? He said: “Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him, and His Messengers, and to believe in the resurrection.” He said: What is Islam? He said: “Islam is to worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, to establish the prescribed prayers, to pay the obligatory zakah, and to fast Ramadan.” He said: What is ihsan? He said: “It is to worship Allah as if you can see Him, for although you cannot see Him, He sees you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 50; Muslim, 9.
See the answer to question no.

for information on some of the beliefs about the noble angels.
II.
The angels are created by Allah, and are among His slaves. The inclination to worship Allah is naturally instilled in them. There is a great deal of evidence to that effect in the Quran and Sunnah, such as the verses in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [at-Tahrim 66:6] and {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded} [An-Nahl 16:50].
Al-Qurtubi said – after narrating the story of Harut and Marut and what was narrated about their story from the People of the Book, who said that they committed sin after Allah instilled desires in them – :
All of this is weak and is unlikely to have been narrated from Ibn `Umar or anyone else, and nothing has been soundly narrated concerning that, because this view is refuted by the fundamental Islamic belief in the angels whom Allah trusted with His revelation, and they are His envoys to His messengers: {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [at-Tahrim 66:6]; { Rather, they [ the angels] are [but] honored servants. They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command} [Al-Anbiya’ 21: 26-27]; {They glorify Him night and day, without flagging } [Al-Anbiya’ 21:20].
From a rational point of view, it is possible that angels could commit sin, and could do that which is contrary to what they are enjoined to do, and it is possible that desires could be instilled in them, because that is something that can be imagined and is within the power of Allah, may He be Exalted. Similar to that is the fear of the prophets and of the virtuous, knowledgeable close friends of Allah, but the possibility of that cannot be confirmed unless there is a sound religious text to support that, but there is no such text.
Tafsir at-Tabari
, 2/52.
In other words, there is no sound text to prove that they committed sin.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The word malak (angel) gives the sense that he is a messenger who carries out the orders of someone else, so the angels have no control over anything; rather all control is in the hand of Allah, the One, the Subduer, and they carry out His commands. {They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command. He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28]; {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded. } [an-Nahl 16:50]; { they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [At-Tahrim 66:6]. They do not descend except by Allah’s command, and they do not do anything except after He gives permission. Therefore they are honourable slaves of Allah; some of them stand in rows [for prayer], some of them constantly glorify Allah, and there is none among them who does not have his known station and does not go beyond it, and he is doing a task that he is commanded to do, in which he does not fall short or go beyond it to do something else. The highest in status among them are those who are with Allah, may He be Glorified; they are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary (of worshipping Him). They glorify Him night and day, without flagging.

What supports this idea is the fact that Allah took away from them all desires, which are what prompt one to commit sin, disobey Allah and drift away.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
As Abu Bakr `Abd al-`Aziz – one of our companions – and others said: The angels were created with reason but no desire, the animals were created with desire but no reason, and man was created with reason and desire. If a person’s reason controls his desire, he is better than the angels, but if his desire controls his reason, animals are better than him.

Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin ash-Shinqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The evidence of those who say that Iblis was not originally an angel is two things, the first of which is that the angels are protected from committing the acts of disbelief that Iblis committed, as Allah, may He be Exalted, tells us about them: {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [at-Tahrim 66:6] and {They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:27].

III.
The fact that the angels are protected from committing sin does not mean that they have no freedom of choice, or that they are compelled to obey Allah without any power or choice on their part. In that case, they would be like puppets or robots, as mentioned in the question. But the honourable angels of Allah are far above being like that. Rather Allah, may He be Exalted, only mentioned their being protected from sin in the context of commending and praising them, and it is known that one who has no strength to obey and has no freedom of choice cannot be praised in such a way. Rather praise is for one who is able to do either. Among humans, for example, the prophets and messengers of Allah are protected from disbelief, lying and immoral actions, according to scholarly consensus, but that does not mean that they did not have the ability to choose to believe or disbelieve, or that they did not do what they did of belief and acts of worship and obedience by choice, or that they did not refrain from what they refrained from of disbelief and immoral deeds by choice. Rather they did that by their own choice, and were protected from doing the opposite, because of Allah’s perfect help and guidance to them in all situations. Something similar may be said about the honourable angels: Allah, may He be Exalted, enabled them to obey Him in all situations and at all times, and He protected them from sin, but that does not mean that they had no choice in that, or that they are not to be praised for that. Similarly, the devils are deprived of divine help in all situations, so they do not choose to believe or to obey Allah, even though they have the ability to do so, and they are deserving of blame for their disbelief and disobedience, and they will be punished for choosing that and doing it.
Imam Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Some foolish people said that the angels are like the air and wind [meaning that they have no freedom of choice]. Abu Muhammad [Ibn Hazm] said:
This is a lie, and it is offensive and disrespectful, because according to the texts of the Quran and Sunnah, and the consensus of all those of different religions who believe in the angels, the angels have reason and are required to show devotion to Allah, and they are required to heed His prohibitions and carry out His commands, but air and wind are not like that, because they do not possess reason and they are not required to show devotion to Allah. Rather they are controlled and directed, and they have no choice …
End quote from Ibn Hazm:
Al-Fasl fil-Milal wal-Ahwa’ wan-Nihal
, 5/17.
Shaykh `Umar al-Ashqar (may Allah preserve him) said:
We may say that the angels are not accountable in the same sense that the sons of Adam are accountable. As for the view that they are not accountable at all, that is a view that is to be rejected, because they are required to do acts of worship and obedience: {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded} [an-Nahl 16:50]. This verse shows that they fear their Lord, and fear is a kind of obligatory act; rather it is one of the most sublime acts of worship, as Allah says regarding them: {And they stand in awe for fear of Him} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28].
`Alam al-Mala’ikat al-Abrar
, p. 21.
Undoubtedly accountability is something that is dependent on reason, knowledge, ability and freedom of choice. This is affirmed by consensus, as it was narrated by Imam Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) that the angels have freedom of choice, and their choice is to obey Allah; they are subject to commands and prohibitions, and they have the ability to comply with both; and they constantly receive divine help and guidance. Therefore they do not choose any option that involves disobeying their Lord.
What indicates that, in addition to the evidence that has been mentioned and quoted above, is the following:
1.The verse {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [At-Tahrim 66:6].
The sinner is not described as disobedient unless he deliberately commits the sin, and the same applies when someone fails to do what he is commanded to do. If the angels were inherently unable (to disobey Allah), Allah would not have praised them for doing what He enjoins, and He would not call what they are unable to do disobedience or sin.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The disobedient one is the one who refuses to obey the command even though he is able to comply with it. If he did not do what Allah enjoined upon him because he is unable to do it, he is not to be called disobedient. When Allah said {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them} [At-Tahrim 66:6], this is not emphasising the fact that they are doing  what they are commanded to do, because the one who is unable to obey cannot be called disobedient, and be described as doing what he is commanded. Rather Allah said: {but [they] do what they are commanded} [at-Tahrim 66:6] to highlight the fact that they are able to do what they are commanded to do, so they do not fail to do it because they are unable to do it or because they want to disobey the command. If someone is commanded to do something, the only reason he may fail to do it is one of two things: either he is not able to do it, or he is disobedient and does not want to obey. If he is obedient and wants to obey the one who is commanding him to do something, and he has the ability do that, then what he is commanded to do will be done. This is how the angels are: they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded.

2.The hadith of Ibn `Abbas, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: My Lord came to me in the best image – in a dream – and said: O Muhammad. I said: Here I am, my Lord, at your service. He said: What are those on high disputing about? I said: My Lord, I do not know… this is supported by the verse in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {I had no knowledge of those on high when they were disputing and discussing} [Sad 38:69]. Here Allah, may He be Exalted, affirms that the angels disputed. This refers to what happened of discussion among them regarding some issues that were mentioned in the hadith, namely degrees of status and acts of expiation.

Therefore the claim that the angels are like puppets or robots cannot be valid and is far-fetched and has nothing to do with reality, and it is not based on any academic proof. How sound is the description that Imam Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) gave to this claim: that it is a foolish lie, as noted above.
Rather the angels are honoured slaves of Allah; they have freedom of choice and they do various acts of obedience and worship, even though they never disobey Allah.
IV.
With regard to the hadith of `Abdullah ibn Salam to which the questioner referred, its text is:
Bishr ibn Shaghaf narrated from `Abdullah ibn Salam, saying: We were sitting in the mosque on a Friday, and he [‘Abdullah ibn Salam] said: The greatest day of this world is Friday. On it Adam was created and on it the Hour will begin. Indeed the most honourable of creation in the sight of Allah is Abul-Qasim (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). Bishr said: I said: May Allah have mercy on you, what about the angels? He looked at me and smiled, and said: O son of my brother, do you know what the angels are? The angels are a creation like the heaven, the earth, the wind, the clouds and all other creations that do not disobey Allah at all.

Dala’il an-Nubuwwah
, 5/485, and in
Shu`ab al-Iman
, 1/309, no. 148.
The isnad of this hadith ends with `Abdullah ibn Salam, as is clear, and it is not attributed directly to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). There is nothing in it that that definitively supports the view of one who holds a different view; rather it may support his view, and the other possibility is that what is meant is that the angels (peace be upon them) do not commit acts of disobedience; rather they carry out the commands that Allah issues to them, as the heaven and earth do. This is in accordance with what we have mentioned above, but it does not mean that the angels have no will. What we have quoted above of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, and so on, definitively proves that the angels do have will and freedom of choice, and this is what Ibn Hazm narrated that there was consensus about.

One of the pillars of belief in Allah, may He be Exalted, is believing in the angels who are close to Him.
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) appeared before the people one day and Jibril came to him and said: What is faith? He said: “Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him, and His Messengers, and to believe in the resurrection.” He said: What is Islam? He said: “Islam is to worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, to establish the prescribed prayers, to pay the obligatory zakah, and to fast Ramadan.” He said: What is ihsan? He said: “It is to worship Allah as if you can see Him, for although you cannot see Him, He sees you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 50; Muslim, 9.

II.
The angels are created by Allah, and are among His slaves. The inclination to worship Allah is naturally instilled in them. There is a great deal of evidence to that effect in the Quran and Sunnah, such as the verses in which Allah, may He be Exalted, says: {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [at-Tahrim 66:6] and {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded} [An-Nahl 16:50].
Al-Qurtubi said – after narrating the story of Harut and Marut and what was narrated about their story from the People of the Book, who said that they committed sin after Allah instilled desires in them – :
All of this is weak and is unlikely to have been narrated from Ibn `Umar or anyone else, and nothing has been soundly narrated concerning that, because this view is refuted by the fundamental Islamic belief in the angels whom Allah trusted with His revelation, and they are His envoys to His messengers: {they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [at-Tahrim 66:6]; { Rather, they [ the angels] are [but] honored servants. They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command} [Al-Anbiya’ 21: 26-27]; {They glorify Him night and day, without flagging } [Al-Anbiya’ 21:20].
From a rational point of view, it is possible that angels could commit sin, and could do that which is contrary to what they are enjoined to do, and it is possible that desires could be instilled in them, because that is something that can be imagined and is within the power of Allah, may He be Exalted. Similar to that is the fear of the prophets and of the virtuous, knowledgeable close friends of Allah, but the possibility of that cannot be confirmed unless there is a sound religious text to support that, but there is no such text.
Tafsir at-Tabari
, 2/52.
In other words, there is no sound text to prove that they committed sin.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The word malak (angel) gives the sense that he is a messenger who carries out the orders of someone else, so the angels have no control over anything; rather all control is in the hand of Allah, the One, the Subduer, and they carry out His commands. {They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command. He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him} [Al-Anbiya’ 21:27-28]; {They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded. } [an-Nahl 16:50]; { they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded} [At-Tahrim 66:6]. They do not descend except by Allah’s command, and they do not do anything except after He gives permission. Therefore they are honourable slaves of Allah; some of them stand in rows [for prayer], some of them constantly glorify Allah, and there is none among them who does not have his known station and does not go beyond it, and he is doing a task that he is commanded to do, in which he does not fall short or go beyond it to do something else. The highest in status among them are those who are with Allah, may He be Glorified; they are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary (of worshipping Him).

A brief look at Hinduism,"Definition
Hinduism, which is also called Brahmanism, is an idolatrous religion that is followed by most of the inhabitants of India. It is a set of beliefs, customs and traditions that took shape over a long time from the fifteenth century BCE until the present day. In the fifteenth century BCE, the original dark-skinned inhabitants of India had some primitive ideas and beliefs. Then the Aryan invaders came passing, by the Iranians on their way, and the Aryans’ beliefs were influenced by the lands they passed through. When they settled in India, there was a mixing of the beliefs of different groups that produced Hinduism as a religion of primitive ideas that promoted worship of nature, ancestors and cows in particular. In the eighth century BCE, Hinduism developed further and the Brahman sect emerged, which promoted the worship of Brahma.
Hinduism has no specific founder, and no specific authors are known for most of their scriptures. The religion developed and its scriptures were written over a long period of time.
Ideas and beliefs
We can understand Hinduism from its scriptures, the way they speak of the divine, their beliefs and their castes, alongside other intellectual and ideological issues.
a) Their scriptures
The Hindus have a huge number of scriptures that are difficult to understand and are written in obscure language. Many other books were written to comment on and explain them and other books were written to summarize these commentaries. All of them are sacred to them. The most significant of them are:
i) The Vedas
Veda is a Sanskrit word meaning wisdom and knowledge. The Vedas depict the life of the Aryans, and the steps for developing intellectual life from naïveté to philosophy. They also contain prayers which express doubt and confusion, and claim divinity for everything to the point of wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence). There are four Vedas.
ii) The Mahabharata
This is an Indian epic, like the Iliad and Odyssey of the Greeks. Its author is Vyasa, the son of the sage Parasara who wrote it in 950 BCE. It describes a war between princes from royal families, in which the gods also participated.
b) The Hindu concept of gods
Monotheism
There is no monotheism in the precise sense. Rather, when they turn to one of their gods, they give him all their attention and focus, to the point that they disregard all other gods, and they address that one as “lord of lords” and “god of gods.”
Polytheism
They say that for every natural phenomenon, beneficial or harmful, there is a god to be worshipped, such as water, air, rivers, mountains… There are many gods to which they seek to draw close by worshipping them and making offerings.
Trinity (Trimurti)
In the ninth century BCE, the priests combined the gods into one god, who brought forth the universe from his essence. This is the one whom they call: 1. Brahma (the creator god); 2. Vishnu (the preserver god); and 3. Shiva (the destroyer god). Whoever worships one of the three gods is worshipping all of them, or is worshipping the one supreme god, as there is no difference between them. Thus they opened the door for the Christians to come up with their belief in the Trinity.
-All Hindus are agreed on regarding as holy the cow, certain types of reptiles, such as snakes, and certain types of animals, such as monkeys, but out of all of these, the cow is venerated above all others. There are statues of cows in temples, houses and public squares, and cows have the right to go anywhere. It is not permissible for a Hindu to harm a cow or slaughter it, and if a cow dies, it is buried with religious rituals.
-The Hindus believe that their gods were incarnated in a human called Krishna, and that in him, man and god met, or that the divine dwelt in the human. They talk about Krishna as the Christians talk about Christ. Shaykh Muhammad Abu Zahrah (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote a comparison between the two religions, showing an amazing resemblance; rather they are identical. At the end of this comparison, he said: Christians should research the origins of their religion.
c) The caste system in Indian society
-From the time the Aryans reached India, they formed castes which still exist up till now, and there is no way to abolish them, because they are eternal categories created by God, as they believe.
-The castes are mentioned in the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), as follows:
1) Brahmins: they are the ones whom the god Brahma created from his mouth. They are teachers, priests and judges, and everyone turns to them to perform rituals for marriage and death. It is not permissible to offer sacrifices except in their presence.
2) Kshatriyas: they are the ones whom the god created from his forearms. They acquire knowledge, make offerings and carry weapons for defence.
3) Vaishyas: They are the ones whom the god created from his thigh. They are farmers and traders; they accumulate wealth and spend it on religious institutions.
4) Shudras: they are the ones whom the god created from his feet. They, along with the dark-skinned indigenous people, are the Dalits (“untouchables”) whose work is limited to serving the other three honourable castes, and they do menial and dirty jobs.
-All Hindus are agreed on accepting this caste system for religious reasons.
-It is permissible for a man to marry from a higher caste, and it is permissible to marry from a lower caste, on condition that the wife is not from the fourth caste, the Shudras. It is not permissible for a man from the Shudra caste to marry a woman from any other caste under any circumstances.
-The Brahmins are the elite, and they are thought to be gods. They have the right to take the property of their Shudra slaves whenever they want.
-The Brahmin who writes the holy book is a man who is forgiven, even if he destroys the three worlds with his sins.
-It is not permissible for the king – no matter what the circumstances – to collect taxes from a Brahmin.
-If a Brahmin commits a capital offence, it is not permissible for the ruler to do anything but shave his head. If anyone else commits a capital offence, he is to be executed.
-A ten-year-old Brahmin is superior to a one-hundred-year old Shudra, as a father is superior to his son.
-It is not appropriate for a Brahmin to die of starvation in his land.
-The Dalits (“untouchables”) are inferior to animals and lower than dogs according to the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu).
-It is good luck for Dalits (“untouchables”) to serve the Brahmins, and they are not entitled to any wage or reward.
-If a Dalit raises his hand or a stick to strike a Brahmin, his hand is to be cut off, and if he kicks him, his foot is to be cut off.
-If a Dalit even thinks of sitting with a Brahmin, the king must brand his buttocks and banish him from the land.
-If a Dalit claims that he is teaching a Brahmin, he is to be forced to drink boiling oil.
-The penalty for killing a dog, cat, frog, lizard, crow, owl or Dalit man is the same.
-Recently there have been some small improvements in the conditions of the Dalits, for fear of others taking advantage of their situation and converting them to other religions, especially Christianity, which is making inroads among them, or communism, which attracts them through the idea of class warfare. And many Dalits have found dignity and equality in Islam, and have embraced the faith.
d) Their beliefs
Their beliefs may be summed up as Karma, reincarnation, moksha (nirvana) and wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence).
1) Karma is the law of requital; that is, the divine system of the universe is based on pure justice, and this justice will inevitably take place, either in this life or in the next life, and requital for one life may take place in another life. This earth is a realm of trial, and is also a realm of punishment and reward.
2) Reincarnation: when a person dies, his body dies and his soul moves on to enter another body, according to his deeds in his previous life, and the soul begins a new cycle.
3) Moksha (nirvana – liberation from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth): good and bad deeds lead to another cycle of life in which the soul will be rewarded or punished according to what it did in the previous cycle.
-The one who does not desire anything and will never desire anything, is freed from servitude to whims and desires and feels at ease with himself, will not be returned to another body; rather his soul moves on and is united with Brahma.
4) Wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence): for the Hindus, their philosophical abstraction reached such a point that man can create ideas, systems and institutions, just as he can preserve them or destroy them. Thus man becomes one with the gods, and his soul becomes the essence of creating power.
a) The soul, like the gods, exists from eternity to eternity, is continuous and is not created.
b) The connection between a man and the gods is like the connection between the spark of fire and the fire itself, and like the connection between the seed and the tree.
c) This universe is nothing but a manifestation of true existence, and the human soul is part of the sublime soul.
d) Other ideas and beliefs:
-Bodies are to be cremated after death, because this allows the soul to ascend vertically, to reach the upper realms in the shortest time. Cremation also releases the soul from the container of the body in a complete way.
-When the soul is released and ascends, there are three realms in front of it:
i) The upper realm; ii) The realm of the angels; iii) The realm of humans, where humans are reincarnated. As for the realm of hell, it is for those who commit sins.
-There is not only one hell; rather for each particular sin there is a hell for those who commit that sin.
-Resurrection in the afterlife is only for souls, not bodies.
-A woman whose husband dies cannot marry again after his death; rather she lives in perpetual misery and is subjected to humiliation and abuse; her status is lower than that of a servant. Hence a woman may burn herself after her husband’s death in order to avoid the suffering that she expects to live through. The law has forbidden this practice in modern India.
Where Hinduism prevails
The Hindu religion ruled the Indian subcontinent and spread throughout it despite the differences in demographics. But there is a huge difference between Muslims and Hindus in the way they see the universe and life, and in the way they view the cow, which Hindus worship whilst Muslims slaughter it and eat its meat. This was the cause of Partition, when the establishment of the state of Pakistan, with its eastern and western parts, most of whose inhabitants are Muslims, was announced. And there remained the Indian state, most of whose inhabitants are Hindus, and Muslims form a large minority in India.

Hinduism, which is also called Brahmanism, is an idolatrous religion that is followed by most of the inhabitants of India. It is a set of beliefs, customs and traditions that took shape over a long time from the fifteenth century BCE until the present day. In the fifteenth century BCE, the original dark-skinned inhabitants of India had some primitive ideas and beliefs. Then the Aryan invaders came passing, by the Iranians on their way, and the Aryans’ beliefs were influenced by the lands they passed through. When they settled in India, there was a mixing of the beliefs of different groups that produced Hinduism as a religion of primitive ideas that promoted worship of nature, ancestors and cows in particular. In the eighth century BCE, Hinduism developed further and the Brahman sect emerged, which promoted the worship of Brahma.
Hinduism has no specific founder, and no specific authors are known for most of their scriptures. The religion developed and its scriptures were written over a long period of time.
Ideas and beliefs
We can understand Hinduism from its scriptures, the way they speak of the divine, their beliefs and their castes, alongside other intellectual and ideological issues.
a) Their scriptures
The Hindus have a huge number of scriptures that are difficult to understand and are written in obscure language. Many other books were written to comment on and explain them and other books were written to summarize these commentaries. All of them are sacred to them. The most significant of them are:
i) The Vedas
Veda is a Sanskrit word meaning wisdom and knowledge. The Vedas depict the life of the Aryans, and the steps for developing intellectual life from naïveté to philosophy. They also contain prayers which express doubt and confusion, and claim divinity for everything to the point of wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence). There are four Vedas.
ii) The Mahabharata
This is an Indian epic, like the Iliad and Odyssey of the Greeks. Its author is Vyasa, the son of the sage Parasara who wrote it in 950 BCE. It describes a war between princes from royal families, in which the gods also participated.
b) The Hindu concept of gods
Monotheism
There is no monotheism in the precise sense. Rather, when they turn to one of their gods, they give him all their attention and focus, to the point that they disregard all other gods, and they address that one as “lord of lords” and “god of gods.”
Polytheism
They say that for every natural phenomenon, beneficial or harmful, there is a god to be worshipped, such as water, air, rivers, mountains… There are many gods to which they seek to draw close by worshipping them and making offerings.
Trinity (Trimurti)
In the ninth century BCE, the priests combined the gods into one god, who brought forth the universe from his essence. This is the one whom they call: 1. Brahma (the creator god); 2. Vishnu (the preserver god); and 3. Shiva (the destroyer god). Whoever worships one of the three gods is worshipping all of them, or is worshipping the one supreme god, as there is no difference between them. Thus they opened the door for the Christians to come up with their belief in the Trinity.
-All Hindus are agreed on regarding as holy the cow, certain types of reptiles, such as snakes, and certain types of animals, such as monkeys, but out of all of these, the cow is venerated above all others. There are statues of cows in temples, houses and public squares, and cows have the right to go anywhere. It is not permissible for a Hindu to harm a cow or slaughter it, and if a cow dies, it is buried with religious rituals.
-The Hindus believe that their gods were incarnated in a human called Krishna, and that in him, man and god met, or that the divine dwelt in the human. They talk about Krishna as the Christians talk about Christ. Shaykh Muhammad Abu Zahrah (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote a comparison between the two religions, showing an amazing resemblance; rather they are identical. At the end of this comparison, he said: Christians should research the origins of their religion.
c) The caste system in Indian society
-From the time the Aryans reached India, they formed castes which still exist up till now, and there is no way to abolish them, because they are eternal categories created by God, as they believe.
-The castes are mentioned in the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), as follows:
1) Brahmins: they are the ones whom the god Brahma created from his mouth. They are teachers, priests and judges, and everyone turns to them to perform rituals for marriage and death. It is not permissible to offer sacrifices except in their presence.
2) Kshatriyas: they are the ones whom the god created from his forearms. They acquire knowledge, make offerings and carry weapons for defence.
3) Vaishyas: They are the ones whom the god created from his thigh. They are farmers and traders; they accumulate wealth and spend it on religious institutions.
4) Shudras: they are the ones whom the god created from his feet. They, along with the dark-skinned indigenous people, are the Dalits (“untouchables”) whose work is limited to serving the other three honourable castes, and they do menial and dirty jobs.
-All Hindus are agreed on accepting this caste system for religious reasons.
-It is permissible for a man to marry from a higher caste, and it is permissible to marry from a lower caste, on condition that the wife is not from the fourth caste, the Shudras. It is not permissible for a man from the Shudra caste to marry a woman from any other caste under any circumstances.
-The Brahmins are the elite, and they are thought to be gods. They have the right to take the property of their Shudra slaves whenever they want.
-The Brahmin who writes the holy book is a man who is forgiven, even if he destroys the three worlds with his sins.
-It is not permissible for the king – no matter what the circumstances – to collect taxes from a Brahmin.
-If a Brahmin commits a capital offence, it is not permissible for the ruler to do anything but shave his head. If anyone else commits a capital offence, he is to be executed.
-A ten-year-old Brahmin is superior to a one-hundred-year old Shudra, as a father is superior to his son.
-It is not appropriate for a Brahmin to die of starvation in his land.
-The Dalits (“untouchables”) are inferior to animals and lower than dogs according to the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu).
-It is good luck for Dalits (“untouchables”) to serve the Brahmins, and they are not entitled to any wage or reward.
-If a Dalit raises his hand or a stick to strike a Brahmin, his hand is to be cut off, and if he kicks him, his foot is to be cut off.
-If a Dalit even thinks of sitting with a Brahmin, the king must brand his buttocks and banish him from the land.
-If a Dalit claims that he is teaching a Brahmin, he is to be forced to drink boiling oil.
-The penalty for killing a dog, cat, frog, lizard, crow, owl or Dalit man is the same.
-Recently there have been some small improvements in the conditions of the Dalits, for fear of others taking advantage of their situation and converting them to other religions, especially Christianity, which is making inroads among them, or communism, which attracts them through the idea of class warfare. And many Dalits have found dignity and equality in Islam, and have embraced the faith.

Their beliefs may be summed up as Karma, reincarnation, moksha (nirvana) and wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence).

Description of al-Buraq which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’ (Night Journey),"I.
Al-Buraq is a mount that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj (Night Journey and Ascent to Heaven). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The linguists said: Al-Buraq is the name of the mount which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’. Ibn Durayd said: The word al-Buraq is derived from
al-barq
(lightning), in sha Allah, because of its speed. It was also said that it is named thus because of its shine and lustre, or because it is white. Al-Qadi said: It may be that it is named thus because it has two colours, as a sheep may be described as
barqa’
if there are spots of black in its white wool. He said: In the hadith, al-Buraq is described as white, and the type of sheep that is described as
barqa’
(having some black spots) is still regarded as being white.
End quote from Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).
It may be that it is not a derived word. Ibn Abi Jamrah said: Al-Buraq was given this unique name as an indication of its uniqueness, because there is no report to suggest that anyone owned it, unlike other mounts of different categories. He said: Allah had the power to take the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) up by himself, without al-Buraq, but riding al-Buraq was by way of an additional honour, because if he had ascended by himself, he would have been like one who is walking, and it is more honourable to ride than to walk.

Fat-h al-Bari

II.
A description of the Buraq that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode is given in As-Sahihayn. Al-Bukhari (3207) and Muslim (162) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Buraq – which is a tall white mount, taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule, whose stride reaches as far as he can see – was brought to me, and I rode it until I reached Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets.”
It was narrated from Anas that Al-Buraq was brought to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the night on which he was taken on his Night Journey, already reined and saddled. It shied away from him, so Jibril said to it: Are you behaving like this with Muhammad? No one dearer to Allah than him has ever ridden you. And it began to sweat.
Classed as authentic by al-Albani in
Sahih at-Tirmidhi
.
This and the Prophet’s words “There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets” indicate that the prophets before our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had also ridden him.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:
An-Nasa’i and Ibn Mardawayh narrated, via Yazid ibn Abi Malik, from Anas, a report in which it says: The prophets before him were given this mount to ride. And something similar is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Sa`id that was narrated by Ibn Is-haq.
This indicates that al-Buraq was prepared for the prophets to ride, contrary to the view of those who deny that.
To sum up:
Al-Buraq is a tall white mount, taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule which places its hoof as far as it can see. It has reins and a saddle, and the prophets (peace be upon them) rode it.
It was narrated by at-Tabarani in
Al-Kabir
(9976) and by Abu Ya`la in his
Musnad
(5036) from Ibn Mas`ud, that al-Buraq was brought to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he and Jibril (blessings of Allah be upon them both) mounted it and it set off with them. When it came to a mountain or hill, its back legs would come up, and when it came downhill, its front legs would come up.
Its isnad includes Hamzah al-A`war, whose hadiths are to be rejected. Imam Ahmad said: His hadiths are to be rejected. Ibn Ma`in said: He is nothing; his hadiths are not to be written down. Al-Jawzjani and ad-Daraqutni said: He is very weak (da’if jiddan). Al-Bukhari said: He is weak and his narration is of no value. An-Nasa’i said: He is not trustworthy.
Tahdhib at-Tahdhib
, 10/353.
Al-Albani said in
Da`if al-Jami`
(131) regarding this hadith: It is very weak.
III.
There is no proof in any hadith, whether it is directly attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or otherwise – as far as we know – that al-Buraq had two wings. Rather that is narrated in some reports that cannot be cited as evidence because of the weakness of their isnads.
Al-Hafiz said in
Al-Fat-h
(7/206):  In a report narrated by Ibn Sa`d from al-Waqidi with his isnads, it says: It [al-Buraq] has two wings, but I have not seen this narrated by anyone else. End quote.
Al-Waqidi – whose name is Muhammad ibn `Umar – was classed as a liar by Imam Ahmad and others. Abu Dawud said: I do not write down his hadiths and I do not narrate from him; I do not doubt that he used to fabricate hadiths. Bandar said: I have not seen anyone more mendacious than him. Is-haq ibn Rahawayh said: In my view, he is one of those who fabricate hadiths.

Tahdhib at-Tahdhib

Ath-Tha`labi narrated in his
Tafsir
(6/56) from Ibn `Abbas a marfu` hadith, which says:
“I saw al-Buraq, a mount which is taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule. Its cheeks were like the cheeks of a man, its tail was like the tail of a camel, its forelock was like the forelock of a horse, its legs were like the legs of camels, its hooves were like the hooves of cattle, its chest was like a red ruby, and its back was like a white pearl. On it was one of the saddles of Paradise, and it had two wings attached to its thighs. It travelled like lightning, and its stride reached as far as it could see.”
Its isnad includes Muhammad ibn as-Sa’ib, who is also known as Abun-Nadr al-Kalbi al-Kufi al-Mufassir. He was a well-known fabricator of hadith. Sufyan said: Al-Kalbi said to me: Everything I narrated to you from Abu Salih is a lie.
Ahmad ibn Zuhayr said: I said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: Is it permissible to read the tafsir of al-Kalbi? He said: No.
Ibn Hibban said: His religious views and the fact that he is clearly a liar mean that there is no need to say anything else about him. He narrated tafsir from Abu Salih from Ibn `Abbas, but Abu Salih did not meet Ibn `Abbas, and al-Kalbi did not hear from Abu Salih. It is not permissible to mention him in books, so how about quoting his narrations as evidence?
Mizan al-I`tidal
, 3/557-559.
Ibn al-Jawzi narrated in
Al-Mawdu`at
(1/288) a lengthy hadith in which it says: “Allah made al-Buraq available to me; it is better than the entire world. It is one of the mounts of paradise; its face is like a human face, its hooves are like the hooves of horses, and its tail is like the tail of a cow. It is taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule, its saddle is a red ruby, its stirrups are made of white pearls, and it has seventy reins of gold. It has two wings that are decorated with pearls and rubies, and written between its eyes are the words:
La ilaha illa Allah Muhammad Rasulullah
(There is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).
Ibn al-Jawzi said:
This hadith is undoubtedly fabricated, and how ignorant, inarticulate and inane is the one who fabricated it. Were it not that I accused Ghulam Khalil of fabricating it, for he is uneducated and a liar, I would have said that the one who fabricated it intended to defame Islam with this hadith. End quote.

Were it not that I accused Ghulam Khalil of fabricating it, for he is uneducated and a liar, I would have said that the one who fabricated it intended to defame Islam with this hadith. End quote.

How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) see some people being punished in Hell on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj?,"It is soundly narrated in the authentic hadiths that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw some people being punished on the night of the Mi`raj. In fact, it says in these reports that he looked into Hell and saw some of them there.
Ahmad (13340) and Abu Dawud (4878) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the night on which my Lord took me up (into heaven), I passed by some people who had nails of copper with which they were scratching their faces and chests. I said: Who are these people, O Jibril? He said: They are the ones who consumed the people’s flesh (i.e., gossiped) and impugned their honour.” Classed as authentic (sahih) by al-Albani and Shu`ayb al-Arna’ut.
Ahmad (12211) and Ibn Hibban (53) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey, I passed by some people whose lips were being cut with scissors of fire. I said: Who are these people? They said: Preachers from among the people of this world who used to instruct the people to do righteous deeds, but forget to do them themselves, and they would recite the Quran but they did not understand it.

As-Silsilat as-Sahihah
, no. 291; and by Shu`ayb (al-Arna’ut) in
Tahqiq al-Musnad
.
There is nothing in these reports to indicate that he saw them in Hell. It may be that he saw them being punished during al-barzakh (the period between death and the Day of Resurrection), as we shall see below:
But Ahmad (2324) narrated from Ibn `Abbas in the story of the Isra’: “… Then he went on and was met by a respectable, dignified old man, who welcomed him and greeted him with salaam, and all of them greeted him with salaam. He said: ‘Who is this, O Jibril?’ He said: This is your father Ibrahim. Then he looked into Hell and saw people consuming corpses. He said: ‘Who are these people, O Jibril?’ He said: These are the ones who consume people’s flesh (i.e., gossip). And he saw a man who looked red and blue, of stocky build and dishevelled. He said: ‘Who is this, O Jibril?’ He said: This is the one who hamstrung the she-camel.”
This hadith was classed as authentic (sahih) by Ibn Kathir in his
Tafsir
and Ahmad ash-Shakir in
Tahqiq al-Musnad
. It was classed as weak (da`if) by Shu`ayb al-Arna’ut. Al-Albani said in
Al-Isra’ wal-Mi`raj
(p. 74): Ibn Kathir said regarding it: It is authentic, and as-Suyuti agreed with him in

This seeing may be understood in one of two ways:
The first way is: that Allah showed him images of those who were being punished, depicting how they will be in the Fire after the resurrection.
This is similar to what Allah showed him of images of Hell and Paradise when he was offering the eclipse prayer, and he saw some people being punished in the Fire, when it is known that they had not yet entered the Fire of the hereafter; rather it was a depiction of what will happen to them. In the hadith of Jabir it says: The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day when Ibrahim, the son of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), died, and the people said: It has become eclipsed because of the death of Ibrahim. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and led the people in prayer… And in this hadith it says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that you have been promised but I saw it during this prayer of mine. Hell was brought and that is when you saw me stepping backwards for fear that its flames might touch me. I saw therein the owner of the curved staff, dragging his intestines in the Fire; he used to steal from the pilgrims with his curved staff, and if he was discovered he would say, ‘It got caught on my curved staff,’ but if he was not noticed then he would keep it. And I saw therein the woman who had a cat which she tied up and did not feed, and she did not let it eat from the vermin of the earth, until it died of starvation. Then Paradise was brought to me, and that is when you saw me move forward until I was back in my place. I stretched out my hand and I wanted to pick some of its fruits so that you could see them, then I thought that I should not do that. And there is nothing that you have been promised but I saw it during this prayer of mine.” Narrated by Muslim, 904. Also narrated in shortened form by al-Bukhari in several places.
The second way is that this is their punishment during al-barzakh (in their graves), which Allah showed to his Prophet, and the grave is the first stage of the hereafter, in which the disbelievers are exposed to the Fire. Allah, may He be Exalted, says:
{and a terrible punishment overwhelmed Pharaoh’s people:
the fire, to which they are exposed morning and afternoon. And on the day when the Hour begins [it will be said]: Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment}[Ghafir 40:45-46].
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: {and a terrible punishment overwhelmed Pharaoh’s people } namely drowning in the sea, then being transferred from there to Hell. For their souls are exposed to the Fire morning and afternoon, until the onset of the Hour. Then when the Day of Resurrection comes, their bodies and souls will be together in the Fire. Hence Allah says: {And on the day when the Hour begins [it will be said]: Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment} That is, the most painful and grievous of torment. This verse is the main evidence quoted by Ahl as-Sunnah to prove that there is punishment during al-barzakh in the graves, specifically the phrase {the fire, to which they are exposed morning and afternoon}.

Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said, commenting on the lengthy hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub which speaks of the Prophet’s dream: Among the things that we learn from this hadith is that the Night Journey happened several times, both when he was awake and in his dreams, at various times. And we learn that some of the sinners are punished during al-barzakh. End quote from

Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the hadith of the Isra’ and Mi`raj in which it was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw some people being punished.
Question: Will there be any punishment before the Day of Resurrection other than the punishment in the grave?
He replied: This may be understood as meaning that these people were depicted to him being punished because of their reprehensible evil deeds, or it may be understood as meaning that this punishment is for them in this world, or it may be understood as being a depiction of the punishment that will happen on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw in his dream two angels who took him by the hand and showed him some of those who are being punished: those who consume riba, the men and women who commit zina, those who sleep and miss the prayer, until the sun rises and they have not prayed, and those who memorise the Quran but do not act in accordance with it. So it may be interpreted in two ways: the first of which is that this punishment is happening to them in the grave, and is happening to their souls during al-barzakh; it is a punishment that has been hastened for them. Or it may be that what is meant by that is that this was showing the type of punishment that will happen to them on the Day of Resurrection, and this is some of the punishment that they will be subjected to on the Day of Resurrection in Hell – We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.
Whatever the case, this is a stern warning to be cautious and avoid these evil deeds, whether that punishment will happen during al-barzakh or in the hereafter. What is most likely to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that it will happen during al-barzakh – we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.

Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) see the condition of the people of Paradise and the condition of the people of Hell on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj, even though the Hour has not yet begun?
He replied: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told us about that, and he told us that he saw Paradise and Hell, and he saw some people being punished and some people enjoying bliss. Allah knows best how he saw that, because matters of the unseen cannot be comprehended by human faculties. If such matters are narrated to us, we are obliged to believe in them as they were narrated, and not discuss how that happens.

The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw those who are being punished as they were being punished during al-barzakh, or it was depicted to him how these people will be punished when they enter Hell after the reckoning.

"When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met his fellow prophets in Bayt al-Maqdis, he met their souls, without their bodies","I.
it is proven in the authentic Sunnah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led his fellow prophets in prayer during his journey to Bayt al-Maqdis.
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “…And I remember when I was among a group of the Prophets, and I saw Musa standing and praying. He was a slim man with curly hair, as if he was one of the men of Shanu’ah. And I saw `Isa ibn Maryam standing and praying, and the closest in resemblance to him is ‘Urwah ibn Mas`ud ath-Thaqafi. And I saw Ibrahim standing and praying, and the closest in resemblance to him is your companion – meaning himself –. The time for prayer came and I led them in prayer.”
Narrated by Muslim, 172.
It was narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered al-Masjid al-Aqsa, he stood and prayed, then he turned, and turned again, and saw the prophets all praying with him.
Narrated by Ahmad, 4/167. There are some reservations about its isnad, but the report quoted above corroborates it.
II.
The scholars differed as to whether this prayer occurred before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was taken up to heaven or after he came back down. What is more likely to be correct is the former.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
`Iyad said: It may be that he led all the prophets in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis, then those of them regarding whom it is mentioned that he saw them in the heavens were taken up, or it may be that he led them in prayer after he came back down from heaven and they came down also…
What is more likely to be the case is that he led them in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis before he was taken up.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 7/209.

The Muslim is required to believe that the life in al-barzakh [the period between death and the Day of Resurrection] is not subject to the same laws as life in this world. If the martyrs are alive during this time [al-barzakh] with their Lord in a perfect sense, then the prophets are alive in a more perfect sense. Hence the Muslim must believe in this life, without discussing how it is or what its true nature is, except on the basis of the revealed texts.
Allah, may He be Exalted, says regarding the life of the martyrs:
{And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision
Rejoicing in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve
They receive good tidings of favor from Allah and bounty and [of the fact] that Allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost } [Al `Imran 3:169-171].
It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophets are alive in their graves, and they pray.”
Narrated by Abu Ya`la in his
Musnad

Shaykh al-Albani also classed it as authentic in
Silsilat al-Ahadith as-Sahihah
, 621.
In
`Awn al-Ma`bud
, 3/261, it says:
Ibn Hajar al-Makki said: What the report affirms, that the prophets have a kind of life by means of which they worship and pray in their graves, in addition to their having no need of food and drink, like the angels, is something concerning which there is no doubt. Al-Bayhaqi wrote a book about that...
The text from the Book of Allah about the martyrs states that they are alive and given provision, and life in their case is connected to their bodies, so how about the prophets and messengers?  End quote.
Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Moreover, you should understand that the life that is affirmed for the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) in this hadith is the life of al-barzakh, which is not the same as life in this world at all, hence we must believe in it without comparing it to the life of this world, or trying to discuss how it is, or likening it to what we know of the life of this world.
This is the attitude that the believer must adopt regarding this matter: believing in what is mentioned in the hadith, without adding anything by way of comparison or personal opinion, as the innovators do, some of whom went so far as to claim that the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his grave is life in a real sense, saying that he eats and drinks and has marital relations with his wives! Rather it is the life of al-barzakh, the nature of which no one knows except Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.

When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met his fellow prophets, did he meet them body and soul, or their souls only, and not their bodies? There are two scholarly views.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Some people wondered about how he saw the prophets in the heavens, even though their bodies are in their graves on earth. The response is that their souls appeared in the form of their bodies, or their bodies were brought on that night so that they could meet the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as an honour to him.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 7/210.
What is most likely to be the case is that he met their souls which appeared in the form of their bodies, with the exception of `Isa (peace be upon him), as he was taken up body and soul. And there is a difference of opinion regarding Idris (peace be upon him), but the more correct view is that he is like his fellow prophets, and not like `Isa (peace be upon him).
So the bodies of the prophets (peace be upon them) are in their graves, and their souls are in heaven, and what Allah, may He be Exalted, decreed for them of meeting the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was only for their souls which appeared in the form of their real bodies. This is what Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Hafiz ibn Hajar and others thought was most likely to be the case.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
With regard to [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] seeing Musa (peace be upon him) and other prophets on the night of the Mi`raj in heaven, as he saw Adam in the lowest heaven, and he saw Yahya and `Isa in the second heaven, Yusuf in the third heaven, Idris in the fourth heaven, Harun in the fifth heaven, Musa in the sixth heaven and Ibrahim in the seventh heaven – or vice versa – he saw only their souls, which appeared in the form of their bodies.
One of the scholars said: perhaps he saw the same bodies that are buried in their graves, but this is not a credible view.
Majmu` al-Fatawa
, 4/328.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
What he saw in heaven of the prophets (peace be upon them) was only their souls, except `Isa, for he was taken up to heaven physically.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 2/113.
This is the favoured view of Abul-Wafa’ ibn `Aqil, as al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar narrated from him. But what appears to be the case is that it is the view of al-Hafiz himself. He refuted the view of some of his shaykhs who favoured the other view, as he (may Allah have mercy on him) said.
There was a difference of opinion regarding the state of the prophets when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met them: were their bodies taken up to meet the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on that night? Or were the souls residing in the places where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw them, and their souls appeared in the form of their bodies, as Abul-Wafa’ ibn `Aqil stated? Some of our shaykhs favoured the first view, and quoted as evidence the report that was soundly narrated by Muslim from Anas, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I saw Musa on the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), standing and praying in his grave.” This indicates that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was travelling on his night journey when he passed by him.
I say: that is not necessarily the case; rather it may be that his soul is connected to his body on earth, and that is why he is able to pray when his soul is residing in heaven.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 7/212.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) explained that it is not possible for the body of Musa (peace be upon him) or anyone else to move from one place to another (when they are in their graves); rather this applies to the soul. Hence when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw Musa (peace be upon him) praying in his grave, then he saw him in Bayt al-Maqdis, then in the sixth heaven, it was only his soul that moved, not his body.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
It is well known that the bodies of the prophets are in their graves, except for `Isa and Idris. If Musa was standing and praying in his grave, then he saw him in the sixth heaven within a short time, this is something that cannot happen to the body.
Majmu` al-Fatawa
, 5/526, 527.
Shaykh Salih Al ash-Shaykh (may Allah preserve him) said:
The more correct of the two views, in my opinion, is that this refers to the souls, not the bodies, except in the case of `Isa (peace be upon him). That is because when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met the other prophets and they prayed with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), either they prayed with him physically, meaning that their bodies had been collected from their graves to meet him, then they were returned to the graves and their souls remained in heaven,
or it was their souls only, because he met them in heaven.
It is well known that the only one who was taken up alive to heaven is `Isa (peace be upon him), and the idea that they were taken up body and soul to heaven on a permanent basis, and their bodies are not in their graves, is an idea for which there is no evidence; rather there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary, namely that the prophets are in their graves and will remain there until the onset of the Hour.
The fact that they died and were buried means that their bodies are on earth, and this is what is usually the case.
As for those who say otherwise, and say that this is something unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that the other prophets were resurrected for him so that he could lead them in prayer and then meet them in heaven,
there must be clear evidence for this unique case, and as I mentioned, after examining the issue, the conclusion is that the evidence contradicts that view.
Whatever the case, these are two scholarly views among both the earlier and later scholars.

And I saw Ibrahim standing and praying, and the closest in resemblance to him is your companion – meaning himself –. The time for prayer came and I led them in prayer.”
Narrated by Muslim, 172.
It was narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered al-Masjid al-Aqsa, he stood and prayed, then he turned, and turned again, and saw the prophets all praying with him.
Narrated by Ahmad, 4/167. There are some reservations about its isnad, but the report quoted above corroborates it.
II.
The scholars differed as to whether this prayer occurred before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was taken up to heaven or after he came back down. What is more likely to be correct is the former.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
`Iyad said: It may be that he led all the prophets in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis, then those of them regarding whom it is mentioned that he saw them in the heavens were taken up, or it may be that he led them in prayer after he came back down from heaven and they came down also…
What is more likely to be the case is that he led them in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis before he was taken up.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 7/209.
III.
The Muslim is required to believe that the life in al-barzakh [the period between death and the Day of Resurrection] is not subject to the same laws as life in this world. If the martyrs are alive during this time [al-barzakh] with their Lord in a perfect sense, then the prophets are alive in a more perfect sense. Hence the Muslim must believe in this life, without discussing how it is or what its true nature is, except on the basis of the revealed texts.
Allah, may He be Exalted, says regarding the life of the martyrs:
{And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision
Rejoicing in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve
They receive good tidings of favor from Allah and bounty and [of the fact] that Allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost } [Al `Imran 3:169-171].
It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophets are alive in their graves, and they pray.”
Narrated by Abu Ya`la in his
Musnad
, 3425; classed as authentic by the commentators thereon.
Shaykh al-Albani also classed it as authentic in
Silsilat al-Ahadith as-Sahihah
, 621.
In
`Awn al-Ma`bud
, 3/261, it says:
Ibn Hajar al-Makki said: What the report affirms, that the prophets have a kind of life by means of which they worship and pray in their graves, in addition to their having no need of food and drink, like the angels, is something concerning which there is no doubt. Al-Bayhaqi wrote a book about that...
The text from the Book of Allah about the martyrs states that they are alive and given provision, and life in their case is connected to their bodies, so how about the prophets and messengers?  End quote.
Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Moreover, you should understand that the life that is affirmed for the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) in this hadith is the life of al-barzakh, which is not the same as life in this world at all, hence we must believe in it without comparing it to the life of this world, or trying to discuss how it is, or likening it to what we know of the life of this world.
This is the attitude that the believer must adopt regarding this matter: believing in what is mentioned in the hadith, without adding anything by way of comparison or personal opinion, as the innovators do, some of whom went so far as to claim that the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his grave is life in a real sense, saying that he eats and drinks and has marital relations with his wives! Rather it is the life of al-barzakh, the nature of which no one knows except Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.

IV.
When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met his fellow prophets, did he meet them body and soul, or their souls only, and not their bodies? There are two scholarly views.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Some people wondered about how he saw the prophets in the heavens, even though their bodies are in their graves on earth. The response is that their souls appeared in the form of their bodies, or their bodies were brought on that night so that they could meet the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as an honour to him.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 7/210.
What is most likely to be the case is that he met their souls which appeared in the form of their bodies, with the exception of `Isa (peace be upon him), as he was taken up body and soul. And there is a difference of opinion regarding Idris (peace be upon him), but the more correct view is that he is like his fellow prophets, and not like `Isa (peace be upon him).
So the bodies of the prophets (peace be upon them) are in their graves, and their souls are in heaven, and what Allah, may He be Exalted, decreed for them of meeting the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was only for their souls which appeared in the form of their real bodies. This is what Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Hafiz ibn Hajar and others thought was most likely to be the case.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
With regard to [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] seeing Musa (peace be upon him) and other prophets on the night of the Mi`raj in heaven, as he saw Adam in the lowest heaven, and he saw Yahya and `Isa in the second heaven, Yusuf in the third heaven, Idris in the fourth heaven, Harun in the fifth heaven, Musa in the sixth heaven and Ibrahim in the seventh heaven – or vice versa – he saw only their souls, which appeared in the form of their bodies.
One of the scholars said: perhaps he saw the same bodies that are buried in their graves, but this is not a credible view.
Majmu` al-Fatawa
, 4/328.
Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
What he saw in heaven of the prophets (peace be upon them) was only their souls, except `Isa, for he was taken up to heaven physically.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 2/113.
This is the favoured view of Abul-Wafa’ ibn `Aqil, as al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar narrated from him. But what appears to be the case is that it is the view of al-Hafiz himself. He refuted the view of some of his shaykhs who favoured the other view, as he (may Allah have mercy on him) said.
There was a difference of opinion regarding the state of the prophets when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met them: were their bodies taken up to meet the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on that night? Or were the souls residing in the places where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw them, and their souls appeared in the form of their bodies, as Abul-Wafa’ ibn `Aqil stated? Some of our shaykhs favoured the first view, and quoted as evidence the report that was soundly narrated by Muslim from Anas, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I saw Musa on the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), standing and praying in his grave.” This indicates that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was travelling on his night journey when he passed by him.
I say: that is not necessarily the case; rather it may be that his soul is connected to his body on earth, and that is why he is able to pray when his soul is residing in heaven.
Fat-h al-Bari
, 7/212.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) explained that it is not possible for the body of Musa (peace be upon him) or anyone else to move from one place to another (when they are in their graves); rather this applies to the soul. Hence when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw Musa (peace be upon him) praying in his grave, then he saw him in Bayt al-Maqdis, then in the sixth heaven, it was only his soul that moved, not his body.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
It is well known that the bodies of the prophets are in their graves, except for `Isa and Idris. If Musa was standing and praying in his grave, then he saw him in the sixth heaven within a short time, this is something that cannot happen to the body.
Majmu` al-Fatawa
, 5/526, 527.
Shaykh Salih Al ash-Shaykh (may Allah preserve him) said:
The more correct of the two views, in my opinion, is that this refers to the souls, not the bodies, except in the case of `Isa (peace be upon him). That is because when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met the other prophets and they prayed with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), either they prayed with him physically, meaning that their bodies had been collected from their graves to meet him, then they were returned to the graves and their souls remained in heaven,
or it was their souls only, because he met them in heaven.
It is well known that the only one who was taken up alive to heaven is `Isa (peace be upon him), and the idea that they were taken up body and soul to heaven on a permanent basis, and their bodies are not in their graves, is an idea for which there is no evidence; rather there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary, namely that the prophets are in their graves and will remain there until the onset of the Hour.
The fact that they died and were buried means that their bodies are on earth, and this is what is usually the case.
As for those who say otherwise, and say that this is something unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that the other prophets were resurrected for him so that he could lead them in prayer and then meet them in heaven,
there must be clear evidence for this unique case, and as I mentioned, after examining the issue, the conclusion is that the evidence contradicts that view.
Whatever the case, these are two scholarly views among both the earlier and later scholars.

Angels,"Allah created the angels from light. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you.” [Muslim, 2996]
The angels are by nature obedient to Allah:
“[they, i.e., angels] disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]
They are created in such a way that they do not eat or drink. Their food is tasbeeh (glorification of Allah) and tahleel (saying La ilaha ill-Allah), as Allah tells us concerning them (interpretation of the meaning):
“They (i.e. the angels) glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so) [21:20]
The angels bear witness to the Oneness of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” [3:18]
Allah has honoured some of the angels by choosing them as messengers, just as He has chosen some of mankind as messengers:
“Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men.” [22:75 – interpretation of the meaning]
When Allah created Adam and He wanted to honour him, He commanded the angels to prostrate to him:
“And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam.’ And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).’” [2:34 – interpretation of the meaning]
The angels are a mighty creation, and they perform many tasks, and they are divided into many groups, which no one knows except Allah. Some of them carry the Throne:
“Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah)…” [40:7 – interpretation of the meaning]
Among them is the one who brings down the revelation to the messengers. He is Jibreel (peace be upon him), who brought the Quran down to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
“Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel] has brought down
Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners.” [26:193 – interpretation of the meaning]
Among them is Mikail, who is appointed in charge of the rain and vegetation, and Israfil who is appointed to blow the Trumpet when the Hour begins. And among them are the recording angels who are appointed to watch over the sons of Adam and their deeds:
“But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,
Kiraman (Honourable) Katibeen —writing down (your deeds),
They know all that you do.” [82: 10-12 – interpretation of the meaning]
Among them are those who are entrusted with the task of writing down all deeds, whether good or evil:
“(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions)
Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).” [50:17-18 – interpretation of the meaning]
Among them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the believers:
“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [16:32 – interpretation of the meaning]
And among them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the disbelievers:
“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): ‘Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire.’” [8:50 – interpretation of the meaning]
Among them are the gatekeepers of Paradise and the servants of the people of Paradise:
“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying):
Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!” [13:23-24 – interpretation of the meaning]
And among them are the gatekeepers of Hell:
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]
Among them are some who strive in jihad (battle) with the believers:
“(Remember) when your Lord revealed to the angels, ‘Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.’” [8:12 – interpretation of the meaning]
On Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Decree) in the month of Ramadan, the angels come down to witness goodness with the Muslims, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).
Therein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel] by Allah’s permission with all decrees.” [97:3-4]
The angels do not enter a house in which there is a statue, picture (image) or a dog. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.” [Muslim].
Belief in the angels is one of the pillars of faith, and whoever denies it is a kafir (disbeliever):
“... and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [4:136 – interpretation of the meaning]

Things that expiate for sins are: staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so.

Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at their head because of their high status. They are described as al-a’ala either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the sight of Allah. Their ""dispute"" refers either to their competing or rushing to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people when they do these good deeds.

Repentance is a blessing from Allah
We praise Allah for having guided you to repent, and we ask Him to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to grant you a good end. You should note that you have been greatly blessed and must give thanks to Allah. How many sinners die without having repented? How many of those who are astray die before turning back to their Lord? Undoubtedly the fact that Allah has enabled you to repent is a great event in your life, and this should be a time when you start to obey Him and strive harder in worshipping Him.
Does Allah forgive all sins?
You should realize that what you have heard about
repentance
, prayer and fasting not being accepted from one who has committed major sins is false, and it is speaking about Allah without knowledge. There is a great deal of evidence in the Book of Allah and the sunnah (teaching) of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that Allah accepts His slave’s repentance from all sins, no matter how great they are, and it is not permissible for anyone to try to stop a person from repenting, no matter how great and how heinous his sins.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [39:53]
Allah says, stating that He
forgives the greatest of sins
(interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such a person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [25:68-70]
Does Allah forgive shirk?
This clearly indicates that Allah forgives all sins – even
shirk
– and it tells us of an immense bounty, which is that bad deeds are turned to good deeds.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“No sin is too great for Allah to forgive for the one who repents, rather He forgives shirk and other sins for those who repent, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [39:53]
This verse is general in meaning because it is addressed to all those who repent.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa)
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There was among the people who came before you a man who killed ninety-nine people. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth, and was directed to a hermit, so he went to him, told him that he had killed ninety-nine people, and asked if he could be forgiven. The hermit said, ‘No,’ so he killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth and was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people, and asked whether he could be forgiven. The scholar said, ‘Yes, what could possibly come between you and repentance? Go to such-and-such a town, for in it there are people who worship Allah. Go and worship with them, and do not go back to your own town, for it is a bad place.” So the man set off, but when he was halfway there, the angel of death came to him, and the angels of mercy and the angels of wrath began to argue over him. The angels of mercy said: ‘He had repented and was seeking Allah.’ The angels of wrath said: ‘He never did any good thing.’ An angel in human form came to them, and they asked him to decide the matter. He said: ‘Measure the distance between the two lands (his home town and the town he was headed for), and whichever of the two he is closest to is the one to which he belongs.’ So they measured the distance, and found that he was closer to the town for which he had been headed, so the angels of mercy took him.”
Al-Tirmidhi narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, said: ‘O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you and I would not mind.’” [Sahih al-Tirmidhi]
Ibn Majah narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.” [Sahih Ibn Majah]
These verses and hadiths (prophetic traditions) indicate that Allah forgives all sins, no matter how great or how many, for the one who repents to Him.
So strive in worship and obedience, regret the negligence and sins of the past, and note that Allah has no need of His slaves yet despite that He rejoices in their repentance, and even
turns their bad deeds into good deeds
.
We ask Allah to help you to remember Him, give thanks to Him and worship Him properly.

Repentance is a blessing from Allah
Does Allah forgive all sins?
Does Allah forgive shirk?
Repentance is a blessing from Allah
We praise Allah for having guided you to repent, and we ask Him to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to grant you a good end. You should note that you have been greatly blessed and must give thanks to Allah. How many sinners die without having repented? How many of those who are astray die before turning back to their Lord? Undoubtedly the fact that Allah has enabled you to repent is a great event in your life, and this should be a time when you start to obey Him and strive harder in worshipping Him.
Does Allah forgive all sins?
You should realize that what you have heard about
repentance
, prayer and fasting not being accepted from one who has committed major sins is false, and it is speaking about Allah without knowledge. There is a great deal of evidence in the Book of Allah and the sunnah (teaching) of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that Allah accepts His slave’s repentance from all sins, no matter how great they are, and it is not permissible for anyone to try to stop a person from repenting, no matter how great and how heinous his sins.

Have some people already been brought to account and admitted to Paradise or Hell?,"Firstly:
It is obligatory for every Muslim to believe that the reckoning after death is real, and that reward and punishment will come after the reckoning. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So, by your Lord, (O Muhammad ), We shall certainly call all of them to account.
93. For all that they used to do” [al-Hijr 15:92-93]
“Then surely, We shall question those (people) to whom it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers” [al-A’raaf 7:6]
Moreover this reckoning will be in two stages:
The first stage is in the grave, after death: that is when the two angels come and ask him about his Lord, his religion and his Prophet, as is mentioned in the mutawaatir ahaadeeth. This is the trial of the grave from which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined us to seek refuge with Allah.
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It has been revealed to me that you will be put to trial in the grave.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1049) and Muslim (584).
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Baari (1/165):
The basic meaning of the word fitnah (translated here as trial) is testing and examining. End quote.
Al-Mannaawi narrated in Fayd al-Qadeer (6/234) that some of the scholars said:
The believer will be tested in the grave so that it will be easier for him in the place of standing (on the Day of Resurrection), so he will be purified in al-Barzakh so that he may emerge with all issues settled. End quote.
There may be reward or punishment after this reckoning, so the one who has succeeded will have blessing and happiness in his grave and the one who has lost will have torment and misery.
All of that happens in the grave or in the life of al-Barzakh. As for Paradise and Hell, no one will enter them fully until after the second stage of the reckoning, which is the reckoning in the Hereafter.
But some souls may enter Paradise, and taste some of its delights, as an honour from Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“The soul of the believer is a bird hanging in the trees of Paradise, until Allah restores it to its body on the day when He resurrects him.”
Narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta’ (1/240); classed as saheeh by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Istidhkaar (2/614).
Hanging in the trees means moving about and eating.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Haadi al-Arwaah (48):
This clearly shows that souls may enter Paradise before the Day of Resurrection. End quote.
Some souls may also be exposed to the Fire and feel some of its heat and torment.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!’” [Ghaafir 40:46]
For the one who passes the test in the grave, the reckoning in the Hereafter will be easier for him.
It was narrated that Haani’ the freed slave of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan said: when ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affaan stood by a grave he would weep until his beard became wet. It was said to him, “You remember Paradise and Hell and you do not weep, but you weep because of this?” He said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The grave is the first of the stages of the Hereafter; whoever is saved from it, whatever comes afterwards will be easier  for him, but if he is not saved from it, what comes afterwards will be worse for him.’” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have never seen any scene but the grave is more frightening than it.”
Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi (2308); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.
The second stage of the reckoning will be after the Resurrection in the Hereafter; this is the great reckoning in which the people of Paradise will be distinguished from the people of Hell, and all scores will be settled along people. That Day is called the Day of Reckoning.
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“This it is what you (Al‑Muttaqoon — the pious) are promised for the Day of Reckoning!” [Saad 38:53]
“Moosa (Moses) said: ‘Verily, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant who believes not in the Day of Reckoning!’” [Ghaafir 40:27]
No one will enter Paradise or Hell until after this reckoning. Some people will have an easy reckoning, and some will have a difficult reckoning. Our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will be the first one to enter Paradise in the full and real sense in the Hereafter.
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The keeper will say: ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say: ‘I was commanded not to open it for anyone before you.’” Narrated by Muslim (193).
Secondly:
With regard to the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that he saw someone in Paradise or in Hell, these are of two types:
1 – Either they were dreams, as in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Bilaal at the time of Fajr prayer: “O Bilaal, tell me of the best deed you have done in Islam, for I heard the sound of your sandals in front of me in Paradise.”
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (3/35):
Al-Karmaani said: The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that the hearing mentioned happened in a dream, because no one can enter Paradise except after death. The idea that it happened in a dream is supported by that which is quoted in the first part of (the chapter on) the virtues of ‘Umar from the marfoo’ hadeeth of Jaabir: “I saw myself entering Paradise and I heard footsteps, and it was said: This is Bilaal. And I saw a palace in the courtyard of which there was a girl, and it was said: This is for ‘Umar. …” After this hadeeth is the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: “Whilst I was sleeping I saw myself in Paradise, and I saw a woman doing wudoo’ beside a palace, and it was said: This is for ‘Umar. …” So it is known that this happened in a dream. This affirmed the virtue of Bilaal, because the dreams of the Prophets are wahy (Revelation), hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) affirmed that for him. End quote.
2 – Or Allah showed His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what would happen in the Hereafter, so that he saw it with his own eyes or in his heart. That includes things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw on the night of the Mi’raaj of things that would happen in Paradise or in Hell. Al-Haafiz al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (6/207):
al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The scholars said: It may be understood as meaning that he saw it with his own eyes, as Allah showed it to him and lifted the barrier between him and it, as He showed him al-Masjid al-Aqsa when he described it.
They said: Or it may be understood as meaning that he saw it by way of knowledge and revelation, so he saw it and learned of it in details that he had not known before that.
Al-Qaadi said: The first interpretation is more likely and is closer to the wording of the hadeeth, because it contains things that point to seeing with the eyes, such as his reaching out to take the bunch of grapes, and his stepping back in fear lest the heat of Hell reach him. End quote.

It is obligatory for every Muslim to believe that the reckoning after death is real, and that reward and punishment will come after the reckoning. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So, by your Lord, (O Muhammad ), We shall certainly call all of them to account.
93. For all that they used to do” [al-Hijr 15:92-93]
“Then surely, We shall question those (people) to whom it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers” [al-A’raaf 7:6]
Moreover this reckoning will be in two stages:
The first stage is in the grave, after death: that is when the two angels come and ask him about his Lord, his religion and his Prophet, as is mentioned in the mutawaatir ahaadeeth. This is the trial of the grave from which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined us to seek refuge with Allah.
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It has been revealed to me that you will be put to trial in the grave.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1049) and Muslim (584).

The Lives of the Prophets,"The Prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) are dead as far as the people of this world are concerned. Allah says, addressing the last and best of them (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die”
[al-Zumar 39:30]
But before Allah they are alive, for if the martyrs are alive with Allah, then the Prophets are undoubtedly higher in status before Allah. See Fath al-Baari, 6/444.
It was narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray.” (Narrated by al-Bazzaar; classed as authentic by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2790). This prayer is something that they are blessed with just as the people of Paradise are blessed with tasbeeh (glorifying Allah).
They (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) are in their graves apart from ‘Eesa (Jesus)(peace be upon him), whom Allah raised up into heaven, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“But they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Eesa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]:
But Allah raised him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”
[al-Nisa’ 4:157-158]
With regard to the Prophets praying behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the night of the Isra’ (Night Journey), they prayed behind him in spirit, but their bodies were in their graves. The same applies to his seeing the Prophets during the Mi’raaj (ascent into heaven), when he saw Adam in the lowest heaven, and ‘Eesa and Yahya in the second heaven, and Yoosuf in the third, and Idrees in the fourth, and Haroon in the fifth, and Moosa in the sixth, and Ibraaheem in the seventh, or vice versa. He saw their souls appear in the shape of their bodies.
Some people say that he saw the same bodies that are buried in the graves, but this view does not carry any weight.
But ‘Eesa ascended into heaven body and soul, and the same is said of Idrees.
But with regard to Ibraaheem, Moosa and others, they are buried on earth.
The Messiah (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and all the other Prophets) will inevitably descend to earth, to the white minaret in the east of Damascus; he will kill the Dajjaal (“Antichrist”), break the cross and kill the pigs, as is proven in the saheeh ahaadeeth (authentic reports). Hence he is in the second heaven even though he is superior to Yoosuf, Idrees and Haroon, because he will descend to the earth before the Day of Resurrection, unlike the other Prophets. And Adam is in the lowest heaven because the souls of his descendents who are blessed (i.e., destined for Paradise) will be shown to him. As for the souls of the doomed (i.e., those who are destined for Hell) the gates of heaven will not be opened for them and they will not enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. So if they will be shown to him, he has to be near them. There is no contradiction in the fact that they (may blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then he met some of them after he was taken up into the heavens, because the souls are like the angels, they may ascend and descend in an instant; they are not like bodies.

Difference between Repentance and Forgiveness in Islam,"Istighfar (seeking forgiveness) is of two types, depending on whether the word is used alone or is accompanied by the word Tawbah (forgiveness). When it is mentioned alone, it essentially means the same as Tawbah.
The two words are interchangeable, each carrying the meaning of the other, when mentioned separately.
When the two words are used together, Istighfar means seeking protection from the evil of what is past, and Tawbah means returning to Allah and seeking protection from the evil of one’s own bad deeds which one fears may lie ahead in the future.
Istighfar and Tawbah are among the pairs of words which the scholars say convey one another’s meanings when used alone, but which have their own separate meanings when they are used together.

Seeking Forgiveness is a Means of Strengthening the Body,"You have done well by forming this good intention for your exercise, for a good intention turns a habit into worship.
As for what you have asked about, whether praying for forgiveness increases a person’s strength, the answer is, yes. Allah, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet Hood (peace be upon him) said to his people (interpretation of the meaning):
“And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn away as Mujrimoon (criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah).” [Hood 11:52]
Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Wabil al-Sayyib (p. 77), when listing the benefits of dhikr (remembrance of Allah), including praying for forgiveness:
Benefit no. 61:
Dhikr gives a person strength so that he can do with dhikr that which he cannot do without it. I saw wonders in the strength of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in walking, speech, courage and writing. He used to write in one day what a scribe would write in a week, or more. The troops saw his amazing strength in war. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught his daughter Fatimah and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) to recite tasbeeh (glorification of Allah) thirty-three times every night when they went to bed, and to recite tahmeed (praises of Allah) thirty-three times, and to recite takbeer (magnification of Allah) thirty-four times, when she asked him for a servant and complained to him about the hardship of grinding corn, working and serving (her family). He taught her this and said: “It is better for you than a servant.” It was said: The one who persists in doing this will find strength in his body that will make him independent of the need for a servant. End quote.
With regard to the times for dhikr and the number of times it should be repeated, the believer should remember Allah at all times and in all situations. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides.” [Al ‘Imran 3:191]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would remember Allah at all times. Narrated by Muslim.
So one should remember Allah a great deal and pray for forgiveness. The more he does that, the better.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance.
And glorify His Praises morning and afternoon [the early morning (Fajr) and ‘Asr prayers].” [al-Ahzab 33:41, 42]
“... and the men and the women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise).” [al-Ahzab 33:35].
Muslim (2702) narrated from al-Agharr al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I ask Allah for forgiveness one hundred times a day.”
And Abu Dawood (1516) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We used to count when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in one sitting one hundred times: Rabb ighfir li wa tubb ‘alayya, innaka anta al-tawab al-raheem (Lord, forgive me and accept my repentance, for You are the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful).

What is shirk?
One of the most important obligations is to know the meaning of shirk, its seriousness and its different types, so that our Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and our Islam may be complete, and our faith may be sound. We say – And Allah is the Source of strength and true guidance comes from Him:
Lexical meaning of shirk
Know – may Allah guide you – that the word shirk in Arabic means taking a partner, i.e., regarding someone as the partner of another. It is said [in Arabic]: ashraka baynahuma (he joined them together) when he regarded them as two of equal status; or ashraka fi amrihi ghayrahu (he introduced another into his affair) when he made two people involved in it.
Meaning of shirk in Shari`ah teminology
In terms of shari’ah or Islamic terminology,
shirk
means ascribing a partner or rival to Allah in Lordship (rububiyyah), worship or in His names and attributes.
A rival is a peer or counterpart. Hence Allah forbids setting up rivals with Him and He condemns those who take them (rivals) as gods instead of or besides Allah in many verses of the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)” [al-Baqarah 2:22]
“And they set up rivals to Allah, to mislead (men) from His path! Say: ‘Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!’” [Ibrahim 14:30]
In the hadith, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies claiming that Allah has a rival, will enter Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4497; Muslim, 92.
Types of shirk
The texts of the Quran and Sunnah indicate that shirk and the ascribing of rivals to Allah sometimes puts a person beyond the pale of Islam and sometimes does not. Hence the scholars divided shirk into two types which they call shirk akbar (major shirk) and shirk asghar (
minor shirk
). There follows a brief description of each type:
Major shirk
This means ascribing to someone other than Allah something that belongs only to Allah, such as Lordship (rububiyyah), divinity (uluhiyyah) and the divine names and attributes (al-asma’ wa’l-sifat).
This kind of shirk may sometimes be outward, such as the shirk of those who worship idols and graves, or the dead or absent.
Or it may sometimes be hidden, such as those who put their trust in other gods besides Allah, or the shirk and kufr of the hypocrites. For even though  their (hypocrites’) shirk puts them beyond the pale of Islam and means that they will abide  forever in Hell, it is a hidden shirk, because they make an outward display of Islam and conceal their kufr and shirk, so they are inwardly mushriks but not outwardly.
Types of major shirk
Shirk may sometimes take the form of beliefs
Such as the belief that there is someone else who creates, gives life and death, reigns or controls the affairs of the universe along with Allah.
Or the belief that there is someone else who must be obeyed absolutely besides Allah, so they follow him in regarding as permissible or forbidden whatever he wants, even if that goes against the religion of the Messengers.
Or they may associate others with Allah in love and veneration, by loving a created being as they love Allah. This is the kind of shirk that Allah does not forgive, and it is the shirk of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals(to Allah). They love them as they love Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:165]
Or the belief that there are those who know the Unseen as well as Allah. This is very common among some of the deviant sects such as the Rafidis (Shi’ah), extreme Sufis, and Batinis (esoteric sects) in general. The Rafidis believe that their imams have knowledge of the unseen, and the Batinis and Sufis believe similar things about their awliya (“saints”), and so on. It is also shirk to believe that there is someone who bestows mercy in a manner that is befitting only for Allah, so he shows mercy as Allah does and forgives sins and overlooks the bad deeds of his worshippers.
Shirk may sometimes take the form of words
Such as those who make du’a or pray to someone other than Allah, or seek his help or seek refuge with him with regard to matters over which no one has control except Allah, whether the person called upon is a prophet, a wali (“saint”), an angel or a jinn, or some other created being. This is a kind of major shirk which puts one beyond the pale of Islam.
Or such as those who make fun of religion or who liken Allah to His creation, or say that there is another creator, provider or controller besides Allah. All of these are major shirk and a grave sin that is not forgiven.
Shirk may sometimes take the form of actions
Such as one who sacrifices, prays or prostrates to something other than Allah, or who promulgates laws to replace the rulings of Allah and makes that the law to which people are obliged to refer for judgement; or one who supports the kafirs and helps them against the believers, and other acts that go against the basic meaning of faith and put the one who does them beyond the pale of Islam. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.
Minor shirk
This includes everything that may lead to major shirk, or which is described in the texts as being shirk, but does not reach the extent of being major shirk.
This is usually of two types:
1 – Being emotionally attached to some means which have no basis and  for which Allah has not given permission, such as hanging up “hands”, turquoise beads etc on the grounds that they offer protection or that they ward off the evil eye. But Allah has not made them the means of such protection, either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe.
[Translator’s note: the “hands” referred to are objects made of metal, pottery etc, usually blue or turquoise in colour, that some people hang up to ward off the evil eye, according to their mistaken belief]
2 – Venerating some people or things in a way that does not go so far as ascribing lordship to them, such as swearing by something other than Allah, or saying, “Were it not for Allah and So and So,” etc.
Guidelines to distinguish major shirk from minor shirk
The scholars have stipulated guidelines to distinguish
major shirk from minor shirk
when shirk is mentioned in the texts of shari’ah. These guidelines include the following:
1 – When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) states clearly that this action is minor shirk, such as in al-Musnad (27742) where it is narrated that Mahmud ibn Labid said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The thing that I fear most for you is minor shirk.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is minor shirk?” He said: “Showing off, for Allah will say on the Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom you were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find with them.’” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 951)
2 – When the word shirk is used in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah in the indefinite form [without the definite article al-]. This usually refers to minor shirk, and there are many examples of this, such as when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Incantations, amulets and love spells are shirk.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3883; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 331)
What is meant by shirk here is minor shirk, not major shirk.
Amulets
are things that are hung on children such as turquoise beads and the like, which they claim will protect them from the evil eye.
Love spells are something that they do, claiming that it will make a woman beloved to her husband and a man beloved to his wife.
3 – If the Sahabah understood from the texts of Shari’ah that what was meant by shirk here was minor shirk, not major. Undoubtedly the understanding of the Sahabah carries weight, because they are the most knowledgeable of the people concerning the religion of Allah, and the most knowledgeable as to the intent of the Lawgiver.
For example, Abu Dawud (3910) narrated from Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (superstitious belief in omens) is shirk, tiyarah is shirk,” three times, and there is no one among us but (will have some of that) but Allah will rid him of it by means of tawakkul (putting his trust in Allah). The words “there is no one among us…” are the words of Ibn Mas’ud, as was explained by the prominent scholars of hadith. This indicates that Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) understood that this was minor shirk, because he could not have said, “There is no one among us…” referring to major shirk. Moreover, major shirk cannot be eliminated by means of tawakkul, rather it is essential to repent therefrom.
4 – If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) interpreted the words shirk or kufr in a manner which indicates that what is meant is a minor form thereof and not the major form.
For example al-Bukhari (1038) and Muslim (74) narrated from Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led the morning prayer for us at al-Hudaybiyah following rainfall during the night. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished, he turned to face the people and said to them: “Do you know what your Lord has said?” They said: “Allah and his Messenger know best.” He said: “This morning one of My slaves became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by the grace of Allah and His mercy,’ that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the stars; and as for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by such-and-such a star, that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the stars.’”
The interpretation of the word
kufr
here is given in another report narrated from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not know what your Lord said? ‘I do not send any blessing upon My slaves but a group among them become kafirs thereby because they refer to the stars and attribute things to the stars.'"" This explains that if a person attributes rainfall to the stars by believing that they caused it to fall – when in fact Allah has not made the stars a means of causing rainfall – his kufr is a kind of ingratitude for the blessing of Allah. It is well known that ingratitude for the blessing of Allah is minor kufr. But if a person believes that the stars are controlling the universe and they are the ones that cause the rain to fall, then this is major shirk.
Types of minor shirk
Minor shirk may sometimes take the form of outward actions, such as wearing talismans, strings, amulets and the like, and other words and deeds. And sometimes it may be hidden, like a little bit of showing off.
It may also take the form of beliefs:
Such as the belief that something may be a cause of bringing benefit or warding off harm, when Allah has not made it so; or believing that there is barakah (blessing) in a thing, when Allah has not made it so.
It sometimes takes the form of words:
Such as when they said, “We have been given rain by such and such a star,” without believing that the stars could independently cause rain to fall; or swearing by something other than Allah, without believing in venerating the thing sworn by or regarding it as equal with Allah; or saying, “Whatever Allah wills and you will,” and so on.
It sometimes takes the form of actions:
Such as hanging up amulets or wearing a talisman or string to dispel or ward off calamity, because everyone who attributes powers to a thing when Allah has not made it so either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe, has associated something with Allah. This also applies to one who touches a thing seeking its barakah (blessing), when Allah has not created any barakah in it, such as kissing the doors of the mosques, touching their thresholds, seeking healing from their dust, and other such actions.
This is a brief look at the division of shirk into major and minor. We cannot go into great detail in this short answer.
Tips for Muslims to avoid shirk
What the Muslim must do is to avoid shirk in both its minor and major forms.
The greatest sin is shirk
and transgression against the unique rights of Allah, which are (for Him) to be worshipped and obeyed Alone, with no partner or associate.
Hence Allah has decreed that the mushrikin will abide forever in Hell and has told us that He will not forgive them, and He has forbidden Paradise to them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin” [al-Nisa 4:48]
“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers” [al-Maidah 5:72]
Every wise and religiously-committed person should fear shirk for himself and should turn to his Lord, asking Him to help him avoid shirk, as al-Khalil [Ibrahim – peace be upon him] said:
“and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols”
[Ibrahim 14:35 – interpretation of the meaning]
One of the salaf said: “Who can claim to be safe from this after Ibrahim?”
So the sincere believer’s fear of shirk should increase as should his desire for his Lord to keep him away from it, and he should say the great du’a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to his Companions when he said to them: “Shirk among you will be more subtle than the footsteps of an ant, but I will teach you something which, if you do it, both minor and major shirk will be kept away from you. Say: Allahumma inni a'udhu bika an ushrika bika wa ana a’lam wa astaghfiruka lima la a’lam (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from associating anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for that of which I am unaware).” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 3731)
Difference between major and minor shirk in terms of ruling
The above refers to the difference between major and minor shirk, defining each and describing its types.
With regard to the difference between them as far as the ruling is concerned:
Major shirk puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, so the one who does that is judged to be out of Islam and to have apostatized therefrom, so he is a kafir and an apostate.
Minor shirk does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam, rather it may be done by a Muslim but he still remains in Islam; but the one who does that is in great danger because minor shirk is a major sin. Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If I were to swear by Allah falsely, that is better for me than if I were to swear by something other than Him sincerely.” So he regarded swearing by something other than Allah (which is minor shirk) as being worse than swearing by Allah falsely, and it is well known that swearing by Allah falsely is a major sin.
We ask Allah to make our hearts steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him, and we seek refuge in His Might – may He be glorified – from going astray, for He is the Ever-Living Who never dies, but the jinn and mankind will die. And Allah knows best and is most wise, and to Him is the final return of all.

Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If I were to swear by Allah falsely, that is better for me than if I were to swear by something other than Him sincerely.” So he regarded swearing by something other than Allah (which is minor shirk) as being worse than swearing by Allah falsely, and it is well known that swearing by Allah falsely is a major sin.
We ask Allah to make our hearts steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him, and we seek refuge in His Might – may He be glorified – from going astray, for He is the Ever-Living Who never dies, but the jinn and mankind will die. And Allah knows best and is most wise, and to Him is the final return of all.

The Fear of Hypocrisy and Losing Good Deeds
Disbelief and its Impact on Good Deeds
One of the basic principles among Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that good deeds are not accepted if they are accompanied by disbelief, and that nothing cancels out all good deeds except disbelief.
This is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
{Say: Spend (in the Cause of Allah) willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).}
{And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad), and that they came not to As-Salah (the prayer) except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.} [At-Tawbah 9:53-54]
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Nothing cancels out good deeds except disbelief, because the one who dies as a believer will inevitably enter Paradise, and he will be brought out of Hell if he does enter it, but if all his good deeds are cancelled out, he will never enter Paradise. Good deeds can only be cancelled out by that which is their opposite, and nothing can be the opposite of all good deeds except disbelief. This is well known from the principles of Sunnah. (End quote from  As-Sarim Al-Maslul, p. 55)
The followers of innovation, such as the Khawarij, Mu`tazilah and Murji’ah differed. The Khawarij and Mu`tazilah went to extremes and said that
major sins erase and cancel out all good deeds
and acts of worship. In contrast, the Murji’ah said that the good deed of faith cancels out all bad deeds.
Do Sins Erase Good Deeds in Islam?
Once it is understood that nothing can cancel out all good deeds except that which cancels out faith altogether, namely disbelief, then can some sins cancel out and erase some good deeds?
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (10/638):
If bad deeds do not cancel out all good deeds, can they cancel out a proportional amount of them, or can some good deeds be erased by sin that is less than disbelief?
There are two views among those who claim adherence to the Sunnah, some who deny that and some who affirm it. End quote.
The first view is that bad deeds do not cancel out good deeds, rather good deeds are the ones that cancel out bad deeds, by the grace and bounty and kindness of Allah.
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jami` li Ahkam Al-Quran (3/295):
The correct `Aqidah is that bad deeds do not cancel out good deeds. (End quote)
The second view is that sins and innovations may cancel out the reward for good deeds as a form of punishment. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah attributed this view in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (10/322) to the majority of Ahl As-Sunnah.
This was also the view favored by Shaykh Al-Islam and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim. He said in Madarij As-Salikin (1/278):
Ahmad stated that in one report and said: A person should get married if he fears for himself; he should borrow money and get married, lest he fall into haram actions which would cancel out his good deeds. (End quote)
The Fear of Hypocrisy and Losing Good Deeds
Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Kitab Al-Iman (the Book of Faith) in his Sahih:
Chapter: Fear of the believer inadvertently cancelling out his good deeds. Ibrahim At-Taymi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When I compare my words with my deeds, I am afraid that my deeds belie my words. Ibn Abu Mulaykah said: I met thirty of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all of whom feared that they might be guilty of hypocrisy, and not one of them said that his faith was like that of Jibreel and Mika’eel. It was narrated from Al-Hasan: No one fears it (hypocrisy) but a believer and no one feels safe from it but a hypocrite. And one should be afraid of persisting in hypocrisy and sin
without repenting
, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {and [they] do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.} [Al `Imran 3:135]
Imam Muslim also entitled a chapter: The believer’s fear of his good deeds being cancelled out.
Imam Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Al-Bukhari’s title for this chapter is suited to what is mentioned in it of good deeds being cancelled out by some sins, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not.} [Al-Hujurat 49:2]
Imam Ahmad said: Al-Hasan ibn Musa said: Hammad ibn Salamah narrated from Habib ibn Ash-Shahid, that Al-Hasan said: These people do not think that some deeds can cancel out others, but Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who believe! Raise not your voices …, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not,} [Al-Hujurat 49:2]
This is also indicated by the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.} [Al-Baqarah 2:264]
{Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so that it is burnt? Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) to you that you may give thought.} [Al-Baqarah 2:266]
Al-Bukhari  (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the people about it and they said: Allah knows best. Ibn `Abbas said: The verse gives a likeness of deeds. ‘Umar said: What deeds? Ibn `Abbas said: Deeds. ‘Umar said: A rich man may strive in obedience of Allah, then Allah sends the shaytan to him and he commits sins until they drown out his good deeds.
`Ata’ Al-Khursani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a man whose deeds end with polytheism or a
major sin
, so all his good deeds are cancelled out.
It is narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not pray `Asr, his deeds are cancelled out.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 553)
It also says in As-Sahih that a man said: By Allah, Allah will not forgive So and so. Allah said: ‘Who is the one who swore by Me that I will not forgive So and so? I have forgiven so and so and I have cancelled out your good deeds. (Narrated by Muslim, 2621)
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Tell Zayd that his Jihad with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will be cancelled out unless he repents. (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni, 3/52 and Al-Bayhaqi, 5/330)
This indicates that some bad deeds cancel out some good deeds, but they may be restored if one repents.
Ibn Abi Hatim narrated in his Tafsir from Abu Ja`far, from Ar-Rabi` ibn Anas, that Abu Al-`Aliyah said: The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) thought that no sin could do harm if one was sincere and that no good deed was of any avail if one associates others with Allah. Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger (Muhammad) and render not vain your deeds.} [Muhammad 47:33]
Then they began to fear
major sins
after they found out that they may cancel out good deeds.
It was narrated from Al-Hasan that he said concerning the words “and render not vain your deeds” i.e., by
committing sins
. It was narrated from Ma`mar from Az-Zuhri concerning the words “and render not vain your deeds” i.e., by committing major sins.
It was narrated that Qatadah said concerning this verse: Whoever among you can avoid rendering vain his righteous deeds by doing bad deeds, let him do so, and there is no strength except with Allah. Good cancels out evil, and evil cancels out good, and what matters is one’s final deeds.
Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There are very many reports from the Salaf about good deeds being cancelled out by major sins, and it would take too long to list them all. Hudhayfah said: Slandering a chaste innocent woman cancels out the good deeds of a hundred years.
It was narrated that `Ata’ said: A man may say a word in anger that destroys the good deeds of sixty or seventy years.
Imam Ahmad said, according to the report of Al-Fadl ibn Ziyad: No one of you can be sure that he will not steal a glance that will cancel out his good deeds.
As for those who say that the view that good deeds may be cancelled out by bad deeds is the view of the Khawarij and Mu`tazilah, this is a false view, and the views of the righteous Salaf do not agree with that. Yes, the Khawarij and Mu`tazilah said that faith is cancelled out by major sins and that major sin dooms one to spend eternity in Hell, but this is a false view which was held by them alone. (Sharh Kitab Al-Iman min Sahih Al-Bukhari, 206-210)
Ibn Al-Qayyim said: The things that cancel out or spoil good deeds are too many to count. It is not the deeds that count, rather it is the protection of one's good deeds from that which may spoil them or cancel them out. (Al-Wabil As-Sayyib, 18).

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise,"Many texts indicate that Paradise and Hell are two creations which currently exist, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise and Hell. This is proven by many events, for example:
The hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “There was an eclipse of the sun during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed… Then he said, ‘The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not become eclipsed because of the death of somebody or because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah.’ The people said, O Messenger of Allah, we saw you taking something from where you were standing, and then we saw you retreating.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ‘I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of its inhabitants were women.’ The people asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why is that?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ‘Because of their ungratefulness.’ It was asked, ‘Are they ungrateful to Allah?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘They are ungrateful to their life companions (husbands) and ungrateful for good deeds. If you are kind towards one of them throughout life, then she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, “I have never seen anything good from you.”’”

Paradise and Hell exist and they will abide so long as Allah wills them to abide,"The scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed that Paradise and Hell are two created things that exist at present. None of them doubt that because of the volume of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah which indicates that.
From the Quran:
Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“[Paradise] prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:133]
“Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers”[al-Hadeed 57:21]
“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him [Jibreel (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time).
Near Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass).
Near it is the Paradise of Abode”[al-Najm 53:13-15]
Allah says concerning Hell (interpretation of the meaning):
“prepared for the disbelievers”[al-Baqarah 2:24]
The word prepared indicates that they exist at present.
From the Sunnah:
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Sidrat al-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass), by which he saw the Paradise of Abode, as it says in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (336) and Saheeh Muslim (237) who narrated the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) which tells the story of the Isra’ (Prophet’s Night Journey). At the end of this hadeeth it says: “Jibraa’eel took me until we reached Sidrat al-Muntaha, which was covered with colours, I do not know what they are. Then I entered Paradise and saw that its domes were pearls and its soil was musk.”
In al-Bukhaari (1290) and Muslim (5111) it is narrated from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you dies, he is shown his place morning and evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is your abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”
According to the lengthy hadeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib, “A voice will call out from heaven, ‘My slave spoke the truth, so provide him with furnishings from Paradise and open for him a door to Paradise so that its fragrant breeze may reach him.’” This is a saheeh hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (4/337) and by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (59).
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (993) and Saheeh Muslim (1512), it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)… and he said: ‘I saw Paradise and I reached out for a bunch of its fruits. If I had managed to take it you would have eaten from it for as long as the earth remains. And I saw Hell, and I have never seen anything more terrifying than it…”
In Saheeh Muslim (646) it is narrated from the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One is Whose hand is my soul, if you had seen what I have seen, you would laugh little and weep much.” They said,  “What have you seen, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “I have seen Paradise and Hell.”
In Sunan al-Tirmidhi (2483) and elsewhere it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “When Allah created Paradise and Hell, he sent Jibreel to Paradise and said, ‘Look at it and at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ So he went and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared for its people therein. Then he went back to Him and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one will hear of it but he will enter it.’ Then He commanded that it should be surrounded with difficult things. Then He said, ‘Go back and look at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ He went back and saw that it was surrounded with difficult things. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will enter it.’ Allah said, ‘Go and look at Hell and see what I have prepared for its people therein.’  [He saw it] with parts of it consuming other parts. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.’ So Allah commanded that it should be surrounded with desires. Then he said, ‘Go back to it.’ So he went back, then he said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will be saved from it and that all will enter it.’” Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (6/320): its isnaad is qawiy (strong).
And there are very many ahaadeeth on this topic. In his Saheeh, al-Bukhaari wrote a chapter entitled Baab ma jaa’a fi Sifat al-Jannah wa annaha makhlooqah (Chapter on what was narrated concerning the description of Paradise and the fact that it has already been created), in which he listed ahaadeeth, such as the one quoted above, which say that Allah shows the dead person his place in Paradise or Hell after he has been placed in his grave.
All that remains for a person to do is to strive his utmost in worshipping his Lord and refraining from disobeying Him, in the hope that He may attain the victory of being admitted to Paradise and being saved from the painful torment. And Allah knows best.

[Translator’s note: the latter book is available in English under the title Paradise and Hell].",general,general,islam,islamqa.info,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14526,,Medium,High,Yes,Q&A,en,"The scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed that Paradise and Hell are two created things that exist at present. None of them doubt that because of the volume of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah which indicates that.
From the Quran:
Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“[Paradise] prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:133]
“Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers”[al-Hadeed 57:21]
“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him [Jibreel (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time).
Near Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass).
Near it is the Paradise of Abode”[al-Najm 53:13-15]
Allah says concerning Hell (interpretation of the meaning):
“prepared for the disbelievers”[al-Baqarah 2:24]
The word prepared indicates that they exist at present.
