I have heard many Muslims say that dogs are dirty and Satan has spit on them. Also, if we touch a dog, we have to wash our hands several times. I haven't been able to find anything concerning this in the Quran, Hadith, or Islamic books. Please help. Summary of answer If you touch a dog when it is not wet, then your hand does not become impure. If you touch a dog when it is wet, this means that the hand becomes impure and must be washed seven times, one of which should be with earth. Similar Topics Answer Is it haram to keep a dog? What to do after touching a dog Is it haram to keep a dog? It is haram to keep a dog unless it is for the purposes for which Islam permits keeping dogs. Whoever keeps a dog – except a dog for hunting or farming – his reward will decrease each day by one or two qirats. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog that is trained for hunting or a dog for herding livestock, his reward will decrease each day by two qirats.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5059; Muslim, 2941; according to another version narrated by them both, “one qeirat”). The word qirat refers to a large amount of reward; if a person’s reward decreases by one qirat, that means that he is sinning, for losing reward is like earning sin, ...",

A man had a wife whose name was Aaminah, and he had a concubine whose name was Sa’diyyah. Aaminah (his wife) breastfed a girl called Zaynab, and the slave woman Sa’diyyah had a daughter whose name was Haleemah. The daughter, Haleemah, got married and had a son called ‘Ali, who grew up and married Zaynab, who had been breastfed by Aaminah. They have been married for many years, and have several sons and daughters. My question is, what is the ruling on this marriage? Is it permissible for me not to tell them, if this marriage is not legitimate?. Answer One of the rulings on radaa’ah (breastfeeding) is that the milk of the wet nurse has an effect on the child she breastfeeds and on his or her children. If Zayd was breastfed by Faatimah, then Zayd and his children are regarded as children of the wet nurse (Faatimah), but his brothers are not connected to them through breastfeeding. But for the wet nurse, the bond established by breastfeeding includes all her relatives, so whoever is related to the wet nurse is also related to the child whom she breastfed. So the husband of the wet nurse is regarded as a father of the child through breastfeeding; her brothers are regarded as maternal uncles through breastfeeding, and her father and grandfathers ar...",

Question : 13359 Did Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever teach people not to eat Fish and Milk together? Summary of answer It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade drinking milk at the same time as eating fish. Similar Topics Answer It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade drinking milk at the same time as eating fish. Since no such thing has been proven, then we should refer to the doctors concerning this issue. If they say that eating these things together is harmful, then they should not be eaten together, rather they should be eaten separately. But if there is no harm in eating them together, then you may do so if you wish. It may be that eating them together is harmful for some people, because of individual sensitivities or allergies, or the nature of their bodies, whilst it is not harmful to others. In conclusion, this matter should be referred to the experts. For more details, please see the following answers: Ruling on eating certain foods only in Ramadan Can Muslims Eat Kosher?

Answer The one who is most entitled to lead the prayers is the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allaah and who has most knowledge of the fiqh of prayer and is most keen to ensure that his prayer is correct. That includes doing the essential parts and obligations of the prayer in the required manner. But if he does not do the prayer or one of its essential parts, such as rukoo’, properly, then the matter is subject to further discussion: -If he is unable to stand or bow or prostrate for a valid reason such as sickness etc., then there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. The most correct view is that his leading the prayers is valid because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The people should be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allaah.” This is the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him), as it says in al-Majmoo’, 4/264, and this was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) as was narrated from him in al-Insaaf, 4/374. If the reason is ignorance or stubbornness, then his mistake should be pointed out to him. If he responds, all well an...",

Question : 13361 If a person has property that he has prepared to rent out, does he have to pay zakaah on this property?. Answer Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is no zakaah on this property, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no zakaah due on the Muslim’s slave or horse.” Rather zakaah is due on the rents, if one hijri year passes from the time of the contract. For example: A man rents out this house for ten thousand, and receives ten thousand after the year is over. He has to pay zakaah on this money, because one year has passed since the contract was signed. Another man rented out his house for ten thousand, five thousand of which is paid at the time of signing the contract, which he spent within two months, and five thousand was to be paid halfway through the year, which he took and spent within two months. When the year ended he did not have anything left of the rent, so no zakaah was due on it, because no full year passed with the money in his possession. In order for zakaah to be obligatory, a full year should pass with it in the person’s possession. Source : Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/208 Have feedback about this content?

Question : 13363 I live in a western country, and I can practice my religion without much difficulty, praise be to Allah. I have seen on your site some ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which forbid Muslims to settle in kaafir lands or to live among the kuffaar. I am now confused about whether to go back to my country or to stay in this country, knowing that if I go back to my country, I will encounter hardship and persecution because of my adherence to the laws of Allah, and I will not be able to find freedom of worship such as I enjoy in the country where I live now. I hope that you can answer my question and explain the ruling on my staying in this country, especially since the Muslim countries are no longer very different from others with regard to adherence to the laws of Islam. Answer The basic principle is that it is not permissible for the Muslim to settle among the mushrikeen if he is unable to practice his religion openly while being able to emigrate to a Muslim country. This is indicated by evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): “In what (condition) were you?” They repl...",

What is the ruling on one who does Tawaf and Sa’i and does not have wudu? May Allah reward you with good. Summary of answer Your Sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah is valid, even if it was done without wudu because having wudu is not a condition of Sa`i. Similar Topics Answer Your Sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah is valid, even if it was done without wudu because having wudu is not a condition of Sa`i . But your Tawaf al-Wada` was not valid, because one of the conditions of Tawaf is that you should be pure.

While there is a specific time for Hajj, you can perform Umrah at any time in the year.3. RulingIn addition, Hajj and Umrah differ regarding the ruling of each of them.Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam. Allah says in the Qur’an{And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither} (Aal `Imran 3:97).📚 Read Also: Responding to the Precious Call of Hajj (Hadiths & Experiences)`Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted...",

    "question": "A brief look at Hinduism",
    "answer": "Definition\nHinduism, which is also called Brahmanism, is an idolatrous religion that is followed by most of the inhabitants of India. It is a set of beliefs, customs and traditions that took shape over a long time from the fifteenth century BCE until the present day. In the fifteenth century BCE, the original dark-skinned inhabitants of India had some primitive ideas and beliefs. Then the Aryan invaders came passing, by the Iranians on their way, and the Aryans’ beliefs were influenced by the lands they passed through. When they settled in India, there was a mixing of the beliefs of different groups that produced Hinduism as a religion of primitive ideas that promoted worship of nature, ancestors and cows in particular. In the eighth century BCE, Hinduism developed further and the Brahman sect emerged, which promoted the worship of Brahma.\nHinduism has no specific founder, and no specific authors are known for most of their scriptures. The religion developed and its scriptures were written over a long period of time.\nIdeas and beliefs\nWe can understand Hinduism from its scriptures, the way they speak of the divine, their beliefs and their castes, alongside other intellectual and ideological issues.\na) Their scriptures\nThe Hindus have a huge number of scriptures that are difficult to understand and are written in obscure language. Many other books were written to comment on and explain them and other books were written to summarize these commentaries. All of them are sacred to them. The most significant of them are:\ni) The Vedas\nVeda is a Sanskrit word meaning wisdom and knowledge. The Vedas depict the life of the Aryans, and the steps for developing intellectual life from naïveté to philosophy. They also contain prayers which express doubt and confusion, and claim divinity for everything to the point of wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence). There are four Vedas.\nii) The Mahabharata\nThis is an Indian epic, like the Iliad and Odyssey of the Greeks. Its author is Vyasa, the son of the sage Parasara who wrote it in 950 BCE. It describes a war between princes from royal families, in which the gods also participated.\nb) The Hindu concept of gods\nMonotheism\nThere is no monotheism in the precise sense. Rather, when they turn to one of their gods, they give him all their attention and focus, to the point that they disregard all other gods, and they address that one as “lord of lords” and “god of gods.”\nPolytheism\nThey say that for every natural phenomenon, beneficial or harmful, there is a god to be worshipped, such as water, air, rivers, mountains… There are many gods to which they seek to draw close by worshipping them and making offerings.\nTrinity (Trimurti)\nIn the ninth century BCE, the priests combined the gods into one god, who brought forth the universe from his essence. This is the one whom they call: 1. Brahma (the creator god); 2. Vishnu (the preserver god); and 3. Shiva (the destroyer god). Whoever worships one of the three gods is worshipping all of them, or is worshipping the one supreme god, as there is no difference between them. Thus they opened the door for the Christians to come up with their belief in the Trinity.\n-All Hindus are agreed on regarding as holy the cow, certain types of reptiles, such as snakes, and certain types of animals, such as monkeys, but out of all of these, the cow is venerated above all others. There are statues of cows in temples, houses and public squares, and cows have the right to go anywhere. It is not permissible for a Hindu to harm a cow or slaughter it, and if a cow dies, it is buried with religious rituals.\n-The Hindus believe that their gods were incarnated in a human called Krishna, and that in him, man and god met, or that the divine dwelt in the human. They talk about Krishna as the Christians talk about Christ. Shaykh Muhammad Abu Zahrah (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote a comparison between the two religions, showing an amazing resemblance; rather they are identical. At the end of this comparison, he said: Christians should research the origins of their religion.\nc) The caste system in Indian society\n-From the time the Aryans reached India, they formed castes which still exist up till now, and there is no way to abolish them, because they are eternal categories created by God, as they believe.\n-The castes are mentioned in the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), as follows:\n1) Brahmins: they are the ones whom the god Brahma created from his mouth. They are teachers, priests and judges, and everyone turns to them to perform rituals for marriage and death. It is not permissible to offer sacrifices except in their presence.\n2) Kshatriyas: they are the ones whom the god created from his forearms. They acquire knowledge, make offerings and carry weapons for defence.\n3) Vaishyas: They are the ones whom the god created from his thigh. They are farmers and traders; they accumulate wealth and spend it on religious institutions.\n4) Shudras: they are the ones whom the god created from his feet. They, along with the dark-skinned indigenous people, are the Dalits (“untouchables”) whose work is limited to serving the other three honourable castes, and they do menial and dirty jobs.\n-All Hindus are agreed on accepting this caste system for religious reasons.\n-It is permissible for a man to marry from a higher caste, and it is permissible to marry from a lower caste, on condition that the wife is not from the fourth caste, the Shudras. It is not permissible for a man from the Shudra caste to marry a woman from any other caste under any circumstances.\n-The Brahmins are the elite, and they are thought to be gods. They have the right to take the property of their Shudra slaves whenever they want.\n-The Brahmin who writes the holy book is a man who is forgiven, even if he destroys the three worlds with his sins.\n-It is not permissible for the king – no matter what the circumstances – to collect taxes from a Brahmin.\n-If a Brahmin commits a capital offence, it is not permissible for the ruler to do anything but shave his head. If anyone else commits a capital offence, he is to be executed.\n-A ten-year-old Brahmin is superior to a one-hundred-year old Shudra, as a father is superior to his son.\n-It is not appropriate for a Brahmin to die of starvation in his land.\n-The Dalits (“untouchables”) are inferior to animals and lower than dogs according to the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu).\n-It is good luck for Dalits (“untouchables”) to serve the Brahmins, and they are not entitled to any wage or reward.\n-If a Dalit raises his hand or a stick to strike a Brahmin, his hand is to be cut off, and if he kicks him, his foot is to be cut off.\n-If a Dalit even thinks of sitting with a Brahmin, the king must brand his buttocks and banish him from the land.\n-If a Dalit claims that he is teaching a Brahmin, he is to be forced to drink boiling oil.\n-The penalty for killing a dog, cat, frog, lizard, crow, owl or Dalit man is the same.\n-Recently there have been some small improvements in the conditions of the Dalits, for fear of others taking advantage of their situation and converting them to other religions, especially Christianity, which is making inroads among them, or communism, which attracts them through the idea of class warfare. And many Dalits have found dignity and equality in Islam, and have embraced the faith.\nd) Their beliefs\nTheir beliefs may be summed up as Karma, reincarnation, moksha (nirvana) and wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence).\n1) Karma is the law of requital; that is, the divine system of the universe is based on pure justice, and this justice will inevitably take place, either in this life or in the next life, and requital for one life may take place in another life. This earth is a realm of trial, and is also a realm of punishment and reward.\n2) Reincarnation: when a person dies, his body dies and his soul moves on to enter another body, according to his deeds in his previous life, and the soul begins a new cycle.\n3) Moksha (nirvana – liberation from the cycle of birth, death and rebirth): good and bad deeds lead to another cycle of life in which the soul will be rewarded or punished according to what it did in the previous cycle.\n-The one who does not desire anything and will never desire anything, is freed from servitude to whims and desires and feels at ease with himself, will not be returned to another body; rather his soul moves on and is united with Brahma.\n4) Wahdat al-wujud (oneness of existence): for the Hindus, their philosophical abstraction reached such a point that man can create ideas, systems and institutions, just as he can preserve them or destroy them. Thus man becomes one with the gods, and his soul becomes the essence of creating power.\na) The soul, like the gods, exists from eternity to eternity, is continuous and is not created.\nb) The connection between a man and the gods is like the connection between the spark of fire and the fire itself, and like the connection between the seed and the tree.\nc) This universe is nothing but a manifestation of true existence, and the human soul is part of the sublime soul.\nd) Other ideas and beliefs:\n-Bodies are to be cremated after death, because this allows the soul to ascend vertically, to reach the upper realms in the shortest time. Cremation also releases the soul from the container of the body in a complete way.\n-When the soul is released and ascends, there are three realms in front of it:\ni) The upper realm; ii) The realm of the angels; iii) The realm of humans, where humans are reincarnated. As for the realm of hell, it is for those who commit sins.\n-There is not only one hell; rather for each particular sin there is a hell for those who commit that sin.\n-Resurrection in the afterlife is only for souls, not bodies.\n-A woman whose husband dies cannot marry again after his death; rather she lives in perpetual misery and is subjected to humiliation and abuse; her status is lower than that of a servant. Hence a woman may burn herself after her husband’s death in order to avoid the suffering that she expects to live through. The law has forbidden this practice in modern India.\nWhere Hinduism prevails\nThe Hindu religion ruled the Indian subcontinent and spread throughout it despite the differences in demographics. But there is a huge difference between Muslims and Hindus in the way they see the universe and life, and in the way they view the cow, which Hindus worship whilst Muslims slaughter it and eat its meat. This was the cause of Partition, when the establishment of the state of Pakistan, with its eastern and western parts, most of whose inhabitants are Muslims, was announced. And there remained the Indian state, most of whose inhabitants are Hindus, and Muslims form a large minority in India.\nThese definitions are taken from\nAl-Mawsu`at al-Muyassarah fil-Adyan wal-Ahzab al-Mu`asirah\n, 2/724-731, with some alterations.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "question": "Description of al-Buraq which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’ (Night Journey)",
    "answer": "I.\nAl-Buraq is a mount that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj (Night Journey and Ascent to Heaven). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe linguists said: Al-Buraq is the name of the mount which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’. Ibn Durayd said: The word al-Buraq is derived from\nal-barq\n(lightning), in sha Allah, because of its speed. It was also said that it is named thus because of its shine and lustre, or because it is white. Al-Qadi said: It may be that it is named thus because it has two colours, as a sheep may be described as\nbarqa’\nif there are spots of black in its white wool. He said: In the hadith, al-Buraq is described as white, and the type of sheep that is described as\nbarqa’\n(having some black spots) is still regarded as being white.\nEnd quote from Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).\nIt may be that it is not a derived word. Ibn Abi Jamrah said: Al-Buraq was given this unique name as an indication of its uniqueness, because there is no report to suggest that anyone owned it, unlike other mounts of different categories. He said: Allah had the power to take the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) up by himself, without al-Buraq, but riding al-Buraq was by way of an additional honour, because if he had ascended by himself, he would have been like one who is walking, and it is more honourable to ride than to walk.\nEnd quote from\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 7/206.\nII.\nA description of the Buraq that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode is given in As-Sahihayn. Al-Bukhari (3207) and Muslim (162) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Buraq – which is a tall white mount, taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule, whose stride reaches as far as he can see – was brought to me, and I rode it until I reached Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets.”\nIt was narrated from Anas that Al-Buraq was brought to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the night on which he was taken on his Night Journey, already reined and saddled. It shied away from him, so Jibril said to it: Are you behaving like this with Muhammad? No one dearer to Allah than him has ever ridden you. And it began to sweat.\nClassed as authentic by al-Albani in\nSahih at-Tirmidhi\n.\nThis and the Prophet’s words “There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets” indicate that the prophets before our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had also ridden him.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nAn-Nasa’i and Ibn Mardawayh narrated, via Yazid ibn Abi Malik, from Anas, a report in which it says: The prophets before him were given this mount to ride. And something similar is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Sa`id that was narrated by Ibn Is-haq.\nThis indicates that al-Buraq was prepared for the prophets to ride, contrary to the view of those who deny that.\nTo sum up:\nAl-Buraq is a tall white mount, taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule which places its hoof as far as it can see. It has reins and a saddle, and the prophets (peace be upon them) rode it.\nIt was narrated by at-Tabarani in\nAl-Kabir\n(9976) and by Abu Ya`la in his\nMusnad\n(5036) from Ibn Mas`ud, that al-Buraq was brought to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he and Jibril (blessings of Allah be upon them both) mounted it and it set off with them. When it came to a mountain or hill, its back legs would come up, and when it came downhill, its front legs would come up.\nIts isnad includes Hamzah al-A`war, whose hadiths are to be rejected. Imam Ahmad said: His hadiths are to be rejected. Ibn Ma`in said: He is nothing; his hadiths are not to be written down. Al-Jawzjani and ad-Daraqutni said: He is very weak (da’if jiddan). Al-Bukhari said: He is weak and his narration is of no value. An-Nasa’i said: He is not trustworthy.\nTahdhib at-Tahdhib\n, 10/353.\nAl-Albani said in\nDa`if al-Jami`\n(131) regarding this hadith: It is very weak.\nIII.\nThere is no proof in any hadith, whether it is directly attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or otherwise – as far as we know – that al-Buraq had two wings. Rather that is narrated in some reports that cannot be cited as evidence because of the weakness of their isnads.\nAl-Hafiz said in\nAl-Fat-h\n(7/206):  In a report narrated by Ibn Sa`d from al-Waqidi with his isnads, it says: It [al-Buraq] has two wings, but I have not seen this narrated by anyone else. End quote.\nAl-Waqidi – whose name is Muhammad ibn `Umar – was classed as a liar by Imam Ahmad and others. Abu Dawud said: I do not write down his hadiths and I do not narrate from him; I do not doubt that he used to fabricate hadiths. Bandar said: I have not seen anyone more mendacious than him. Is-haq ibn Rahawayh said: In my view, he is one of those who fabricate hadiths.\nSee:\nTahdhib at-Tahdhib\n, 9/323-326.\nAth-Tha`labi narrated in his\nTafsir\n(6/56) from Ibn `Abbas a marfu` hadith, which says:\n“I saw al-Buraq, a mount which is taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule. Its cheeks were like the cheeks of a man, its tail was like the tail of a camel, its forelock was like the forelock of a horse, its legs were like the legs of camels, its hooves were like the hooves of cattle, its chest was like a red ruby, and its back was like a white pearl. On it was one of the saddles of Paradise, and it had two wings attached to its thighs. It travelled like lightning, and its stride reached as far as it could see.”\nIts isnad includes Muhammad ibn as-Sa’ib, who is also known as Abun-Nadr al-Kalbi al-Kufi al-Mufassir.

    "detailedExplanation": "I.\nAl-Buraq is a mount that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj (Night Journey and Ascent to Heaven). An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nThe linguists said: Al-Buraq is the name of the mount which the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode on the night of the Isra’. Ibn Durayd said: The word al-Buraq is derived from\nal-barq\n(lightning), in sha Allah, because of its speed. It was also said that it is named thus because of its shine and lustre, or because it is white. Al-Qadi said: It may be that it is named thus because it has two colours, as a sheep may be described as\nbarqa’\nif there are spots of black in its white wool. He said: In the hadith, al-Buraq is described as white, and the type of sheep that is described as\nbarqa’\n(having some black spots) is still regarded as being white.\nEnd quote from Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).\nIt may be that it is not a derived word. Ibn Abi Jamrah said: Al-Buraq was given this unique name as an indication of its uniqueness, because there is no report to suggest that anyone owned it, unlike other mounts of different categories. He said: Allah had the power to take the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) up by himself, without al-Buraq, but riding al-Buraq was by way of an additional honour, because if he had ascended by himself, he would have been like one who is walking, and it is more honourable to ride than to walk.\nEnd quote from\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 7/206.\nII.\nA description of the Buraq that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) rode is given in As-Sahihayn. Al-Bukhari (3207) and Muslim (162) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Buraq – which is a tall white mount, taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule, whose stride reaches as far as he can see – was brought to me, and I rode it until I reached Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets.”\nIt was narrated from Anas that Al-Buraq was brought to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the night on which he was taken on his Night Journey, already reined and saddled. It shied away from him, so Jibril said to it: Are you behaving like this with Muhammad? No one dearer to Allah than him has ever ridden you. And it began to sweat.\nClassed as authentic by al-Albani in\nSahih at-Tirmidhi\n.\nThis and the Prophet’s words “There I tethered it to the ring which was used by the Prophets” indicate that the prophets before our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) had also ridden him.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:\nAn-Nasa’i and Ibn Mardawayh narrated, via Yazid ibn Abi Malik, from Anas, a report in which it says: The prophets before him were given this mount to ride. And something similar is mentioned in the hadith of Abu Sa`id that was narrated by Ibn Is-haq.\nThis indicates that al-Buraq was prepared for the prophets to ride, contrary to the view of those who deny that.\nTo sum up:\nAl-Buraq is a tall white mount, taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule which places its hoof as far as it can see. It has reins and a saddle, and the prophets (peace be upon them) rode it.\nIt was narrated by at-Tabarani in\nAl-Kabir\n(9976) and by Abu Ya`la in his\nMusnad\n(5036) from Ibn Mas`ud, that al-Buraq was brought to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he and Jibril (blessings of Allah be upon them both) mounted it and it set off with them. When it came to a mountain or hill, its back legs would come up, and when it came downhill, its front legs would come up.\nIts isnad includes Hamzah al-A`war, whose hadiths are to be rejected. Imam Ahmad said: His hadiths are to be rejected. Ibn Ma`in said: He is nothing; his hadiths are not to be written down. Al-Jawzjani and ad-Daraqutni said: He is very weak (da’if jiddan). Al-Bukhari said: He is weak and his narration is of no value. An-Nasa’i said: He is not trustworthy.\nTahdhib at-Tahdhib\n, 10/353.\nAl-Albani said in\nDa`if al-Jami`\n(131) regarding this hadith: It is very weak.\nIII.\nThere is no proof in any hadith, whether it is directly attributed to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) or otherwise – as far as we know – that al-Buraq had two wings. Rather that is narrated in some reports that cannot be cited as evidence because of the weakness of their isnads.\nAl-Hafiz said in\nAl-Fat-h\n(7/206):  In a report narrated by Ibn Sa`d from al-Waqidi with his isnads, it says: It [al-Buraq] has two wings, but I have not seen this narrated by anyone else. End quote.\nAl-Waqidi – whose name is Muhammad ibn `Umar – was classed as a liar by Imam Ahmad and others. Abu Dawud said: I do not write down his hadiths and I do not narrate from him; I do not doubt that he used to fabricate hadiths. Bandar said: I have not seen anyone more mendacious than him. Is-haq ibn Rahawayh said: In my view, he is one of those who fabricate hadiths.\nSee:\nTahdhib at-Tahdhib\n, 9/323-326.\nAth-Tha`labi narrated in his\nTafsir\n(6/56) from Ibn `Abbas a marfu` hadith, which says:\n“I saw al-Buraq, a mount which is taller than a donkey and shorter than a mule. Its cheeks were like the cheeks of a man, its tail was like the tail of a camel, its forelock was like the forelock of a horse, its legs were like the legs of camels, its hooves were like the hooves of cattle, its chest was like a red ruby, and its back was like a white pearl. On it was one of the saddles of Paradise, and it had two wings attached to its thighs. It travelled like lightning, and its stride reached as far as it could see.”\nIts isnad includes Muhammad ibn as-Sa’ib, who is also known as Abun-Nadr al-Kalbi al-Kufi al-Mufassir. He was a well-known fabricator of hadith. Sufyan said: Al-Kalbi said to me: Everything I narrated to you from Abu Salih is a lie.\nAhmad ibn Zuhayr said: I said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: Is it permissible to read the tafsir of al-Kalbi? He said: No.\nIbn Hibban said: His religious views and the fact that he is clearly a liar mean that there is no need to say anything else about him.

    "question": "How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) see some people being punished in Hell on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj?",
    "answer": "It is soundly narrated in the authentic hadiths that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw some people being punished on the night of the Mi`raj. In fact, it says in these reports that he looked into Hell and saw some of them there.\nAhmad (13340) and Abu Dawud (4878) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the night on which my Lord took me up (into heaven), I passed by some people who had nails of copper with which they were scratching their faces and chests. I said: Who are these people, O Jibril? He said: They are the ones who consumed the people’s flesh (i.e., gossiped) and impugned their honour.” Classed as authentic (sahih) by al-Albani and Shu`ayb al-Arna’ut.\nAhmad (12211) and Ibn Hibban (53) narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “On the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey, I passed by some people whose lips were being cut with scissors of fire. I said: Who are these people? They said: Preachers from among the people of this world who used to instruct the people to do righteous deeds, but forget to do them themselves, and they would recite the Quran but they did not understand it.\nClassed as authentic (sahih) by al-Albani in\nAs-Silsilat as-Sahihah\n, no. 291; and by Shu`ayb (al-Arna’ut) in\nTahqiq al-Musnad\n.\nThere is nothing in these reports to indicate that he saw them in Hell. It may be that he saw them being punished during al-barzakh (the period between death and the Day of Resurrection), as we shall see below:\nBut Ahmad (2324) narrated from Ibn `Abbas in the story of the Isra’: “… Then he went on and was met by a respectable, dignified old man, who welcomed him and greeted him with salaam, and all of them greeted him with salaam. He said: ‘Who is this, O Jibril?’ He said: This is your father Ibrahim. Then he looked into Hell and saw people consuming corpses. He said: ‘Who are these people, O Jibril?’ He said: These are the ones who consume people’s flesh (i.e., gossip). And he saw a man who looked red and blue, of stocky build and dishevelled. He said: ‘Who is this, O Jibril?’ He said: This is the one who hamstrung the she-camel.”\nThis hadith was classed as authentic (sahih) by Ibn Kathir in his\nTafsir\nand Ahmad ash-Shakir in\nTahqiq al-Musnad\n. It was classed as weak (da`if) by Shu`ayb al-Arna’ut. Al-Albani said in\nAl-Isra’ wal-Mi`raj\n(p. 74): Ibn Kathir said regarding it: It is authentic, and as-Suyuti agreed with him in\nAl-Khasa’is\n, 1/397. But they are clearly lenient in their evaluation, because there are some reservations about Qabus – who is ibn Abi Zubyan – as he said in\nAt-Taqrib\n. End quote.\nThis seeing may be understood in one of two ways:\nThe first way is: that Allah showed him images of those who were being punished, depicting how they will be in the Fire after the resurrection.\nThis is similar to what Allah showed him of images of Hell and Paradise when he was offering the eclipse prayer, and he saw some people being punished in the Fire, when it is known that they had not yet entered the Fire of the hereafter; rather it was a depiction of what will happen to them. In the hadith of Jabir it says: The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on the day when Ibrahim, the son of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), died, and the people said: It has become eclipsed because of the death of Ibrahim. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stood up and led the people in prayer… And in this hadith it says that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that you have been promised but I saw it during this prayer of mine. Hell was brought and that is when you saw me stepping backwards for fear that its flames might touch me. I saw therein the owner of the curved staff, dragging his intestines in the Fire; he used to steal from the pilgrims with his curved staff, and if he was discovered he would say, ‘It got caught on my curved staff,’ but if he was not noticed then he would keep it. And I saw therein the woman who had a cat which she tied up and did not feed, and she did not let it eat from the vermin of the earth, until it died of starvation. Then Paradise was brought to me, and that is when you saw me move forward until I was back in my place. I stretched out my hand and I wanted to pick some of its fruits so that you could see them, then I thought that I should not do that. And there is nothing that you have been promised but I saw it during this prayer of mine.” Narrated by Muslim, 904. Also narrated in shortened form by al-Bukhari in several places.\nThe second way is that this is their punishment during al-barzakh (in their graves), which Allah showed to his Prophet, and the grave is the first stage of the hereafter, in which the disbelievers are exposed to the Fire. Allah, may He be Exalted, says:\n{and a terrible punishment overwhelmed Pharaoh’s people:\nthe fire, to which they are exposed morning and afternoon. And on the day when the Hour begins [it will be said]: Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment}[Ghafir 40:45-46].\nAl-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: {and a terrible punishment overwhelmed Pharaoh’s people } namely drowning in the sea, then being transferred from there to Hell. For their souls are exposed to the Fire morning and afternoon, until the onset of the Hour. Then when the Day of Resurrection comes, their bodies and souls will be together in the Fire. Hence Allah says: {And on the day when the Hour begins [it will be said]: Admit the people of Pharaoh to the severest punishment} That is, the most painful and grievous of torment. This verse is the main evidence quoted by Ahl as-Sunnah to prove that there is punishment during al-barzakh in the graves, specifically the phrase {the fire, to which they are exposed morning and afternoon}.\nEnd quote from\nTafsir Ibn Kathir\n, 7/146.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said, commenting on the lengthy hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub which speaks of the Prophet’s dream: Among the things that we learn from this hadith is that the Night Journey happened several times, both when he was awake and in his dreams, at various times. And we learn that some of the sinners are punished during al-barzakh. End quote from\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 12/445.\nShaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the hadith of the Isra’ and Mi`raj in which it was narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw some people being punished.\nQuestion: Will there be any punishment before the Day of Resurrection other than the punishment in the grave?\nHe replied: This may be understood as meaning that these people were depicted to him being punished because of their reprehensible evil deeds, or it may be understood as meaning that this punishment is for them in this world, or it may be understood as being a depiction of the punishment that will happen on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw in his dream two angels who took him by the hand and showed him some of those who are being punished: those who consume riba, the men and women who commit zina, those who sleep and miss the prayer, until the sun rises and they have not prayed, and those who memorise the Quran but do not act in accordance with it. So it may be interpreted in two ways: the first of which is that this punishment is happening to them in the grave, and is happening to their souls during al-barzakh; it is a punishment that has been hastened for them. Or it may be that what is meant by that is that this was showing the type of punishment that will happen to them on the Day of Resurrection, and this is some of the punishment that they will be subjected to on the Day of Resurrection in Hell – We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\nWhatever the case, this is a stern warning to be cautious and avoid these evil deeds, whether that punishment will happen during al-barzakh or in the hereafter. What is most likely to be the case – and Allah knows best – is that it will happen during al-barzakh – we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\nEnd quote from the website of Shaykh Ibn Baz.\nShaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: How did the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) see the condition of the people of Paradise and the condition of the people of Hell on the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj, even though the Hour has not yet begun?\nHe replied: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) has told us about that, and he told us that he saw Paradise and Hell, and he saw some people being punished and some people enjoying bliss. Allah knows best how he saw that, because matters of the unseen cannot be comprehended by human faculties. If such matters are narrated to us, we are obliged to believe in them as they were narrated, and not discuss how that happens.\nEnd quote from\nMajmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin\n, 2/53.\nConclusion:\nThe Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw those who are being punished as they were being punished during al-barzakh, or it was depicted to him how these people will be punished when they enter Hell after the reckoning.\nFor more information, please see the answer to question no.\n89813\n.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "question": "When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met his fellow prophets in Bayt al-Maqdis, he met their souls, without their bodies",
    "answer": "I.\nit is proven in the authentic Sunnah that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) led his fellow prophets in prayer during his journey to Bayt al-Maqdis.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “…And I remember when I was among a group of the Prophets, and I saw Musa standing and praying. He was a slim man with curly hair, as if he was one of the men of Shanu’ah. And I saw `Isa ibn Maryam standing and praying, and the closest in resemblance to him is ‘Urwah ibn Mas`ud ath-Thaqafi. And I saw Ibrahim standing and praying, and the closest in resemblance to him is your companion – meaning himself –. The time for prayer came and I led them in prayer.”\nNarrated by Muslim, 172.\nIt was narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) entered al-Masjid al-Aqsa, he stood and prayed, then he turned, and turned again, and saw the prophets all praying with him.\nNarrated by Ahmad, 4/167. There are some reservations about its isnad, but the report quoted above corroborates it.\nII.\nThe scholars differed as to whether this prayer occurred before the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was taken up to heaven or after he came back down. What is more likely to be correct is the former.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n`Iyad said: It may be that he led all the prophets in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis, then those of them regarding whom it is mentioned that he saw them in the heavens were taken up, or it may be that he led them in prayer after he came back down from heaven and they came down also…\nWhat is more likely to be the case is that he led them in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis before he was taken up.\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 7/209.\nIII.\nThe Muslim is required to believe that the life in al-barzakh [the period between death and the Day of Resurrection] is not subject to the same laws as life in this world. If the martyrs are alive during this time [al-barzakh] with their Lord in a perfect sense, then the prophets are alive in a more perfect sense. Hence the Muslim must believe in this life, without discussing how it is or what its true nature is, except on the basis of the revealed texts.\nAllah, may He be Exalted, says regarding the life of the martyrs:\n{And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision\nRejoicing in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve\nThey receive good tidings of favor from Allah and bounty and [of the fact] that Allah does not allow the reward of believers to be lost } [Al `Imran 3:169-171].\nIt was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophets are alive in their graves, and they pray.”\nNarrated by Abu Ya`la in his\nMusnad\n, 3425; classed as authentic by the commentators thereon.\nShaykh al-Albani also classed it as authentic in\nSilsilat al-Ahadith as-Sahihah\n, 621.\nIn\n`Awn al-Ma`bud\n, 3/261, it says:\nIbn Hajar al-Makki said: What the report affirms, that the prophets have a kind of life by means of which they worship and pray in their graves, in addition to their having no need of food and drink, like the angels, is something concerning which there is no doubt. Al-Bayhaqi wrote a book about that...\nThe text from the Book of Allah about the martyrs states that they are alive and given provision, and life in their case is connected to their bodies, so how about the prophets and messengers?  End quote.\nShaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nMoreover, you should understand that the life that is affirmed for the prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) in this hadith is the life of al-barzakh, which is not the same as life in this world at all, hence we must believe in it without comparing it to the life of this world, or trying to discuss how it is, or likening it to what we know of the life of this world.\nThis is the attitude that the believer must adopt regarding this matter: believing in what is mentioned in the hadith, without adding anything by way of comparison or personal opinion, as the innovators do, some of whom went so far as to claim that the life of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in his grave is life in a real sense, saying that he eats and drinks and has marital relations with his wives! Rather it is the life of al-barzakh, the nature of which no one knows except Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.\nAs-Silsilat as-Sahihah\n, 2/120.\nSee also the answer to question no.\n26117\n.\nIV.\nWhen the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met his fellow prophets, did he meet them body and soul, or their souls only, and not their bodies? There are two scholarly views.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nSome people wondered about how he saw the prophets in the heavens, even though their bodies are in their graves on earth. The response is that their souls appeared in the form of their bodies, or their bodies were brought on that night so that they could meet the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), as an honour to him.\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 7/210.\nWhat is most likely to be the case is that he met their souls which appeared in the form of their bodies, with the exception of `Isa (peace be upon him), as he was taken up body and soul. And there is a difference of opinion regarding Idris (peace be upon him), but the more correct view is that he is like his fellow prophets, and not like `Isa (peace be upon him).\nSo the bodies of the prophets (peace be upon them) are in their graves, and their souls are in heaven, and what Allah, may He be Exalted, decreed for them of meeting the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was only for their souls which appeared in the form of their real bodies. This is what Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Hafiz ibn Hajar and others thought was most likely to be the case.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWith regard to [the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)] seeing Musa (peace be upon him) and other prophets on the night of the Mi`raj in heaven, as he saw Adam in the lowest heaven, and he saw Yahya and `Isa in the second heaven, Yusuf in the third heaven, Idris in the fourth heaven, Harun in the fifth heaven, Musa in the sixth heaven and Ibrahim in the seventh heaven – or vice versa – he saw only their souls, which appeared in the form of their bodies.\nOne of the scholars said: perhaps he saw the same bodies that are buried in their graves, but this is not a credible view.\nMajmu` al-Fatawa\n, 4/328.\nAl-Hafiz Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nWhat he saw in heaven of the prophets (peace be upon them) was only their souls, except `Isa, for he was taken up to heaven physically.\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 2/113.\nThis is the favoured view of Abul-Wafa’ ibn `Aqil, as al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar narrated from him. But what appears to be the case is that it is the view of al-Hafiz himself. He refuted the view of some of his shaykhs who favoured the other view, as he (may Allah have mercy on him) said.\nThere was a difference of opinion regarding the state of the prophets when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met them: were their bodies taken up to meet the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) on that night? Or were the souls residing in the places where the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw them, and their souls appeared in the form of their bodies, as Abul-Wafa’ ibn `Aqil stated? Some of our shaykhs favoured the first view, and quoted as evidence the report that was soundly narrated by Muslim from Anas, according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I saw Musa on the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), standing and praying in his grave.” This indicates that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was travelling on his night journey when he passed by him.\nI say: that is not necessarily the case; rather it may be that his soul is connected to his body on earth, and that is why he is able to pray when his soul is residing in heaven.\nFat-h al-Bari\n, 7/212.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) explained that it is not possible for the body of Musa (peace be upon him) or anyone else to move from one place to another (when they are in their graves); rather this applies to the soul. Hence when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) saw Musa (peace be upon him) praying in his grave, then he saw him in Bayt al-Maqdis, then in the sixth heaven, it was only his soul that moved, not his body.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nIt is well known that the bodies of the prophets are in their graves, except for `Isa and Idris. If Musa was standing and praying in his grave, then he saw him in the sixth heaven within a short time, this is something that cannot happen to the body.\nMajmu` al-Fatawa\n, 5/526, 527.\nShaykh Salih Al ash-Shaykh (may Allah preserve him) said:\nThe more correct of the two views, in my opinion, is that this refers to the souls, not the bodies, except in the case of `Isa (peace be upon him). That is because when the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) met the other prophets and they prayed with him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), either they prayed with him physically, meaning that their bodies had been collected from their graves to meet him, then they were returned to the graves and their souls remained in heaven,\nor it was their souls only, because he met them in heaven.\nIt is well known that the only one who was taken up alive to heaven is `Isa (peace be upon him), and the idea that they were taken up body and soul to heaven on a permanent basis, and their bodies are not in their graves, is an idea for which there is no evidence; rather there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary, namely that the prophets are in their graves and will remain there until the onset of the Hour.\nThe fact that they died and were buried means that their bodies are on earth, and this is what is usually the case.\nAs for those who say otherwise, and say that this is something unique to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), that the other prophets were resurrected for him so that he could lead them in prayer and then meet them in heaven,\nthere must be clear evidence for this unique case, and as I mentioned, after examining the issue, the conclusion is that the evidence contradicts that view.\nWhatever the case, these are two scholarly views among both the earlier and later scholars.\nSharh al-`Aqidat at-Tahawiyyah\n, tape no. 14.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "answer": "Allah created the angels from light. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you.” [Muslim, 2996]\nThe angels are by nature obedient to Allah:\n“[they, i.e., angels] disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]\nThey are created in such a way that they do not eat or drink. Their food is tasbeeh (glorification of Allah) and tahleel (saying La ilaha ill-Allah), as Allah tells us concerning them (interpretation of the meaning):\n“They (i.e. the angels) glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so) [21:20]\nThe angels bear witness to the Oneness of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” [3:18]\nAllah has honoured some of the angels by choosing them as messengers, just as He has chosen some of mankind as messengers:\n“Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men.” [22:75 – interpretation of the meaning]\nWhen Allah created Adam and He wanted to honour him, He commanded the angels to prostrate to him:\n“And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam.’ And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).’” [2:34 – interpretation of the meaning]\nThe angels are a mighty creation, and they perform many tasks, and they are divided into many groups, which no one knows except Allah. Some of them carry the Throne:\n“Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah)…” [40:7 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them is the one who brings down the revelation to the messengers. He is Jibreel (peace be upon him), who brought the Quran down to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):\n“Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel] has brought down\nUpon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners.” [26:193 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them is Mikail, who is appointed in charge of the rain and vegetation, and Israfil who is appointed to blow the Trumpet when the Hour begins. And among them are the recording angels who are appointed to watch over the sons of Adam and their deeds:\n“But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,\nKiraman (Honourable) Katibeen —writing down (your deeds),\nThey know all that you do.” [82: 10-12 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are those who are entrusted with the task of writing down all deeds, whether good or evil:\n“(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions)\nNot a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).” [50:17-18 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the believers:\n“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [16:32 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd among them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the disbelievers:\n“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): ‘Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire.’” [8:50 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are the gatekeepers of Paradise and the servants of the people of Paradise:\n“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying):\nSalamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!” [13:23-24 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd among them are the gatekeepers of Hell:\n“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are some who strive in jihad (battle) with the believers:\n“(Remember) when your Lord revealed to the angels, ‘Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.’” [8:12 – interpretation of the meaning]\nOn Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Decree) in the month of Ramadan, the angels come down to witness goodness with the Muslims, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).\nTherein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel] by Allah’s permission with all decrees.” [97:3-4]\nThe angels do not enter a house in which there is a statue, picture (image) or a dog. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.” [Muslim].\nBelief in the angels is one of the pillars of faith, and whoever denies it is a kafir (disbeliever):\n“... and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [4:136 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd Allah knows best.",

And among them are the recording angels who are appointed to watch over the sons of Adam and their deeds:\n“But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,\nKiraman (Honourable) Katibeen —writing down (your deeds),\nThey know all that you do.” [82: 10-12 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are those who are entrusted with the task of writing down all deeds, whether good or evil:\n“(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions)\nNot a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).” [50:17-18 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the believers:\n“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [16:32 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd among them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the disbelievers:\n“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): ‘Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire.’” [8:50 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are the gatekeepers of Paradise and the servants of the people of Paradise:\n“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying):\nSalamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!” [13:23-24 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd among them are the gatekeepers of Hell:\n“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAmong them are some who strive in jihad (battle) with the believers:\n“(Remember) when your Lord revealed to the angels, ‘Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.’” [8:12 – interpretation of the meaning]\nOn Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Decree) in the month of Ramadan, the angels come down to witness goodness with the Muslims, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).\nTherein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel] by Allah’s permission with all decrees.” [97:3-4]\nThe angels do not enter a house in which there is a statue, picture (image) or a dog. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.” [Muslim].\nBelief in the angels is one of the pillars of faith, and whoever denies it is a kafir (disbeliever):\n“... and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [4:136 – interpretation of the meaning]\nAnd Allah knows best.",

Only this has been inspired to me, that I am a plain warner.’\" [38:69-70]\nIn his commentary on this ayah (verse), Shaykh al-Mufassireen Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \"‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high (al-mala al-a’ala) when they were disputing and discussing’: here Allah is telling His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , ‘O Muhammad, say to the mushrikeen (polytheists) among your people: \"I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing\" about the creation of Adam before Allah revealed this to me.’ What this means is: ‘My telling you about this is clear proof that this Quran is a Revelation from Allah, because you know that I had no knowledge of this before this Quran was revealed; it is not something I witnessed with my own two eyes – I know it only because Allah has informed me of it.’\"\nOther scholars of tafseer (exegesis) have said something similar to this.\nThe comments of other scholars:\nIbn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: \"Allah’s words (interpretation of the meaning) ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, when they were consulted about the creation of Adam, and they disputed it and said: Do not place a khaleefah (vicegerent) on earth.\"\nAl-Sa’adi said: \"‘… The chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ means: ‘… when your Lord said to the angels: \"Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth\"…’ [2:30]\nQutadah said: \"The words ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, who disputed the creation of Adam when Allah said to them, (interpretation of the meaning) ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay’.” [38:71].\nAs regards what was reported in the sunnah, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah spoke to him in a dream and said, \"O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high are disputing about?… about the things which expiate for sins. Things that expiate for sins are: staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so.

Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at their head because of their high status. They are described as al-a’ala either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the sight of Allah. Their \"dispute\" refers either to their competing or rushing to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people when they do these good deeds. It may have been called a \"dispute\" because it came in the form of questions and answers, which sounds like a dispute or a debate, hence it was appropriate to use the word \"dispute\" in this context.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "answer": "Table Of Contents\nRepentance is a blessing from Allah\nDoes Allah forgive all sins?\nDoes Allah forgive shirk?\nRepentance is a blessing from Allah\nWe praise Allah for having guided you to repent, and we ask Him to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to grant you a good end. You should note that you have been greatly blessed and must give thanks to Allah. How many sinners die without having repented? How many of those who are astray die before turning back to their Lord? Undoubtedly the fact that Allah has enabled you to repent is a great event in your life, and this should be a time when you start to obey Him and strive harder in worshipping Him.\nDoes Allah forgive all sins?\nYou should realize that what you have heard about\nrepentance\n, prayer and fasting not being accepted from one who has committed major sins is false, and it is speaking about Allah without knowledge. There is a great deal of evidence in the Book of Allah and the sunnah (teaching) of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that Allah accepts His slave’s repentance from all sins, no matter how great they are, and it is not permissible for anyone to try to stop a person from repenting, no matter how great and how heinous his sins.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [39:53]\nAllah says, stating that He\nforgives the greatest of sins\n(interpretation of the meaning):\n“And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such a person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.\nThe torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;\nExcept those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [25:68-70]\nDoes Allah forgive shirk?\nThis clearly indicates that Allah forgives all sins – even\nshirk\n– and it tells us of an immense bounty, which is that bad deeds are turned to good deeds.\nShaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\n“No sin is too great for Allah to forgive for the one who repents, rather He forgives shirk and other sins for those who repent, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins.

Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth, and was directed to a hermit, so he went to him, told him that he had killed ninety-nine people, and asked if he could be forgiven. The hermit said, ‘No,’ so he killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth and was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people, and asked whether he could be forgiven. The scholar said, ‘Yes, what could possibly come between you and repentance? Go to such-and-such a town, for in it there are people who worship Allah. Go and worship with them, and do not go back to your own town, for it is a bad place.” So the man set off, but when he was halfway there, the angel of death came to him, and the angels of mercy and the angels of wrath began to argue over him. The angels of mercy said: ‘He had repented and was seeking Allah.’ The angels of wrath said: ‘He never did any good thing.’ An angel in human form came to them, and they asked him to decide the matter. He said: ‘Measure the distance between the two lands (his home town and the town he was headed for), and whichever of the two he is closest to is the one to which he belongs.’ So they measured the distance, and found that he was closer to the town for which he had been headed, so the angels of mercy took him.”\nAl-Tirmidhi narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, said: ‘O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you and I would not mind.’” [Sahih al-Tirmidhi]\nIbn Majah narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.” [Sahih Ibn Majah]\nThese verses and hadiths (prophetic traditions) indicate that Allah forgives all sins, no matter how great or how many, for the one who repents to Him.\nSo strive in worship and obedience, regret the negligence and sins of the past, and note that Allah has no need of His slaves yet despite that He rejoices in their repentance, and even\nturns their bad deeds into good deeds\n.\nWe ask Allah to help you to remember Him, give thanks to Him and worship Him properly.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

    "question": "Have some people already been brought to account and admitted to Paradise or Hell?",
    "answer": "Firstly:\nIt is obligatory for every Muslim to believe that the reckoning after death is real, and that reward and punishment will come after the reckoning. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“So, by your Lord, (O Muhammad ), We shall certainly call all of them to account.\n93. For all that they used to do” [al-Hijr 15:92-93]\n“Then surely, We shall question those (people) to whom it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers” [al-A’raaf 7:6]\nMoreover this reckoning will be in two stages:\nThe first stage is in the grave, after death: that is when the two angels come and ask him about his Lord, his religion and his Prophet, as is mentioned in the mutawaatir ahaadeeth. This is the trial of the grave from which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined us to seek refuge with Allah.\nIt was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It has been revealed to me that you will be put to trial in the grave.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1049) and Muslim (584).\nIbn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fath al-Baari (1/165):\nThe basic meaning of the word fitnah (translated here as trial) is testing and examining. End quote.\nAl-Mannaawi narrated in Fayd al-Qadeer (6/234) that some of the scholars said:\nThe believer will be tested in the grave so that it will be easier for him in the place of standing (on the Day of Resurrection), so he will be purified in al-Barzakh so that he may emerge with all issues settled. End quote.\nThere may be reward or punishment after this reckoning, so the one who has succeeded will have blessing and happiness in his grave and the one who has lost will have torment and misery.\nAll of that happens in the grave or in the life of al-Barzakh. As for Paradise and Hell, no one will enter them fully until after the second stage of the reckoning, which is the reckoning in the Hereafter.\nBut some souls may enter Paradise, and taste some of its delights, as an honour from Allah, may He be blessed and exalted.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:\n“The soul of the believer is a bird hanging in the trees of Paradise, until Allah restores it to its body on the day when He resurrects him.”\nNarrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta’ (1/240); classed as saheeh by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Istidhkaar (2/614).\nHanging in the trees means moving about and eating.\nIbn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Haadi al-Arwaah (48):\nThis clearly shows that souls may enter Paradise before the Day of Resurrection. End quote.\nSome souls may also be exposed to the Fire and feel some of its heat and torment.\nAllah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!’” [Ghaafir 40:46]\nFor the one who passes the test in the grave, the reckoning in the Hereafter will be easier for him.\nIt was narrated that Haani’ the freed slave of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan said: when ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affaan stood by a grave he would weep until his beard became wet. It was said to him, “You remember Paradise and Hell and you do not weep, but you weep because of this?” He said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The grave is the first of the stages of the Hereafter; whoever is saved from it, whatever comes afterwards will be easier  for him, but if he is not saved from it, what comes afterwards will be worse for him.’” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have never seen any scene but the grave is more frightening than it.”\nNarrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi (2308); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.\nThe second stage of the reckoning will be after the Resurrection in the Hereafter; this is the great reckoning in which the people of Paradise will be distinguished from the people of Hell, and all scores will be settled along people. That Day is called the Day of Reckoning.\nAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“This it is what you (Al‑Muttaqoon — the pious) are promised for the Day of Reckoning!” [Saad 38:53]\n“Moosa (Moses) said: ‘Verily, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant who believes not in the Day of Reckoning!’” [Ghaafir 40:27]\nNo one will enter Paradise or Hell until after this reckoning. Some people will have an easy reckoning, and some will have a difficult reckoning. Our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will be the first one to enter Paradise in the full and real sense in the Hereafter.\nIt was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The keeper will say: ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say: ‘I was commanded not to open it for anyone before you.’” Narrated by Muslim (193).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that he saw someone in Paradise or in Hell, these are of two types:\n1 – Either they were dreams, as in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Bilaal at the time of Fajr prayer: “O Bilaal, tell me of the best deed you have done in Islam, for I heard the sound of your sandals in front of me in Paradise.”\nAl-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (3/35):\nAl-Karmaani said: The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that the hearing mentioned happened in a dream, because no one can enter Paradise except after death. The idea that it happened in a dream is supported by that which is quoted in the first part of (the chapter on) the virtues of ‘Umar from the marfoo’ hadeeth of Jaabir: “I saw myself entering Paradise and I heard footsteps, and it was said: This is Bilaal. And I saw a palace in the courtyard of which there was a girl, and it was said: This is for ‘Umar. …” After this hadeeth is the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: “Whilst I was sleeping I saw myself in Paradise, and I saw a woman doing wudoo’ beside a palace, and it was said: This is for ‘Umar. …” So it is known that this happened in a dream. This affirmed the virtue of Bilaal, because the dreams of the Prophets are wahy (Revelation), hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) affirmed that for him. End quote.\n2 – Or Allah showed His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what would happen in the Hereafter, so that he saw it with his own eyes or in his heart. That includes things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw on the night of the Mi’raaj of things that would happen in Paradise or in Hell. Al-Haafiz al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (6/207):\nal-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The scholars said: It may be understood as meaning that he saw it with his own eyes, as Allah showed it to him and lifted the barrier between him and it, as He showed him al-Masjid al-Aqsa when he described it.\nThey said: Or it may be understood as meaning that he saw it by way of knowledge and revelation, so he saw it and learned of it in details that he had not known before that.\nAl-Qaadi said: The first interpretation is more likely and is closer to the wording of the hadeeth, because it contains things that point to seeing with the eyes, such as his reaching out to take the bunch of grapes, and his stepping back in fear lest the heat of Hell reach him. End quote.\nSee also the answers to questions no.\n4003\n,\n5643\n,\n12478\nand\n14526\n.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

The keeper will say: ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say: ‘I was commanded not to open it for anyone before you.’” Narrated by Muslim (193).\nSecondly:\nWith regard to the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that he saw someone in Paradise or in Hell, these are of two types:\n1 – Either they were dreams, as in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Bilaal at the time of Fajr prayer: “O Bilaal, tell me of the best deed you have done in Islam, for I heard the sound of your sandals in front of me in Paradise.”\nAl-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (3/35):\nAl-Karmaani said: The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that the hearing mentioned happened in a dream, because no one can enter Paradise except after death. The idea that it happened in a dream is supported by that which is quoted in the first part of (the chapter on) the virtues of ‘Umar from the marfoo’ hadeeth of Jaabir: “I saw myself entering Paradise and I heard footsteps, and it was said: This is Bilaal. And I saw a palace in the courtyard of which there was a girl, and it was said: This is for ‘Umar. …” After this hadeeth is the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: “Whilst I was sleeping I saw myself in Paradise, and I saw a woman doing wudoo’ beside a palace, and it was said: This is for ‘Umar. …” So it is known that this happened in a dream. This affirmed the virtue of Bilaal, because the dreams of the Prophets are wahy (Revelation), hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) affirmed that for him. End quote.\n2 – Or Allah showed His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what would happen in the Hereafter, so that he saw it with his own eyes or in his heart. That includes things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw on the night of the Mi’raaj of things that would happen in Paradise or in Hell. Al-Haafiz al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (6/207):\nal-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The scholars said: It may be understood as meaning that he saw it with his own eyes, as Allah showed it to him and lifted the barrier between him and it, as He showed him al-Masjid al-Aqsa when he described it.\nThey said: Or it may be understood as meaning that he saw it by way of knowledge and revelation, so he saw it and learned of it in details that he had not known before that.\nAl-Qaadi said: The first interpretation is more likely and is closer to the wording of the hadeeth, because it contains things that point to seeing with the eyes, such as his reaching out to take the bunch of grapes, and his stepping back in fear lest the heat of Hell reach him.

    "question": "The Lives of the Prophets",
    "answer": "The Prophets (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) are dead as far as the people of this world are concerned. Allah says, addressing the last and best of them (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die”\n[al-Zumar 39:30]\nBut before Allah they are alive, for if the martyrs are alive with Allah, then the Prophets are undoubtedly higher in status before Allah. See Fath al-Baari, 6/444.\nIt was narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray.” (Narrated by al-Bazzaar; classed as authentic by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2790). This prayer is something that they are blessed with just as the people of Paradise are blessed with tasbeeh (glorifying Allah).\nThey (blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) are in their graves apart from ‘Eesa (Jesus)(peace be upon him), whom Allah raised up into heaven, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“But they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Eesa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]:\nBut Allah raised him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”\n[al-Nisa’ 4:157-158]\nWith regard to the Prophets praying behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the night of the Isra’ (Night Journey), they prayed behind him in spirit, but their bodies were in their graves. The same applies to his seeing the Prophets during the Mi’raaj (ascent into heaven), when he saw Adam in the lowest heaven, and ‘Eesa and Yahya in the second heaven, and Yoosuf in the third, and Idrees in the fourth, and Haroon in the fifth, and Moosa in the sixth, and Ibraaheem in the seventh, or vice versa. He saw their souls appear in the shape of their bodies.\nSome people say that he saw the same bodies that are buried in the graves, but this view does not carry any weight.\nBut ‘Eesa ascended into heaven body and soul, and the same is said of Idrees.\nBut with regard to Ibraaheem, Moosa and others, they are buried on earth.\nThe Messiah (may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him and all the other Prophets) will inevitably descend to earth, to the white minaret in the east of Damascus; he will kill the Dajjaal (“Antichrist”), break the cross and kill the pigs, as is proven in the saheeh ahaadeeth (authentic reports). Hence he is in the second heaven even though he is superior to Yoosuf, Idrees and Haroon, because he will descend to the earth before the Day of Resurrection, unlike the other Prophets. And Adam is in the lowest heaven because the souls of his descendents who are blessed (i.e., destined for Paradise) will be shown to him. As for the souls of the doomed (i.e., those who are destined for Hell) the gates of heaven will not be opened for them and they will not enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. So if they will be shown to him, he has to be near them. There is no contradiction in the fact that they (may blessings and peace of Allah be upon them) prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then he met some of them after he was taken up into the heavens, because the souls are like the angels, they may ascend and descend in an instant; they are not like bodies.\nAdapted from Majmoo’ al-Fataawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), 4/328-329.",

    "question": "What Is Shirk and its types?",
    "answer": "Table Of Contents\nWhat is shirk?\nLexical meaning of shirk\nMeaning of shirk in Shari`ah teminology\nTypes of shirk\nMajor shirk\nTypes of major shirk\nMinor shirk\nGuidelines to distinguish major shirk from minor shirk\nTypes of minor shirk\nTips for Muslims to avoid shirk\nDifference between major and minor shirk in terms of ruling\nWhat is shirk?\nOne of the most important obligations is to know the meaning of shirk, its seriousness and its different types, so that our Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and our Islam may be complete, and our faith may be sound. We say – And Allah is the Source of strength and true guidance comes from Him:\nLexical meaning of shirk\nKnow – may Allah guide you – that the word shirk in Arabic means taking a partner, i.e., regarding someone as the partner of another. It is said [in Arabic]: ashraka baynahuma (he joined them together) when he regarded them as two of equal status; or ashraka fi amrihi ghayrahu (he introduced another into his affair) when he made two people involved in it.\nMeaning of shirk in Shari`ah teminology\nIn terms of shari’ah or Islamic terminology,\nshirk\nmeans ascribing a partner or rival to Allah in Lordship (rububiyyah), worship or in His names and attributes.\nA rival is a peer or counterpart. Hence Allah forbids setting up rivals with Him and He condemns those who take them (rivals) as gods instead of or besides Allah in many verses of the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)” [al-Baqarah 2:22]\n“And they set up rivals to Allah, to mislead (men) from His path! Say: ‘Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!’” [Ibrahim 14:30]\nIn the hadith, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies claiming that Allah has a rival, will enter Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4497; Muslim, 92.\nTypes of shirk\nThe texts of the Quran and Sunnah indicate that shirk and the ascribing of rivals to Allah sometimes puts a person beyond the pale of Islam and sometimes does not. Hence the scholars divided shirk into two types which they call shirk akbar (major shirk) and shirk asghar (\nminor shirk\n). There follows a brief description of each type:\nMajor shirk\nThis means ascribing to someone other than Allah something that belongs only to Allah, such as Lordship (rububiyyah), divinity (uluhiyyah) and the divine names and attributes (al-asma’ wa’l-sifat).\nThis kind of shirk may sometimes be outward, such as the shirk of those who worship idols and graves, or the dead or absent.\nOr it may sometimes be hidden, such as those who put their trust in other gods besides Allah, or the shirk and kufr of the hypocrites. For even though  their (hypocrites’) shirk puts them beyond the pale of Islam and means that they will abide  forever in Hell, it is a hidden shirk, because they make an outward display of Islam and conceal their kufr and shirk, so they are inwardly mushriks but not outwardly.\nTypes of major shirk\nShirk may sometimes take the form of beliefs\nSuch as the belief that there is someone else who creates, gives life and death, reigns or controls the affairs of the universe along with Allah.\nOr the belief that there is someone else who must be obeyed absolutely besides Allah, so they follow him in regarding as permissible or forbidden whatever he wants, even if that goes against the religion of the Messengers.\nOr they may associate others with Allah in love and veneration, by loving a created being as they love Allah. This is the kind of shirk that Allah does not forgive, and it is the shirk of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals(to Allah). They love them as they love Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:165]\nOr the belief that there are those who know the Unseen as well as Allah. This is very common among some of the deviant sects such as the Rafidis (Shi’ah), extreme Sufis, and Batinis (esoteric sects) in general. The Rafidis believe that their imams have knowledge of the unseen, and the Batinis and Sufis believe similar things about their awliya (“saints”), and so on. It is also shirk to believe that there is someone who bestows mercy in a manner that is befitting only for Allah, so he shows mercy as Allah does and forgives sins and overlooks the bad deeds of his worshippers.\nShirk may sometimes take the form of words\nSuch as those who make du’a or pray to someone other than Allah, or seek his help or seek refuge with him with regard to matters over which no one has control except Allah, whether the person called upon is a prophet, a wali (“saint”), an angel or a jinn, or some other created being. This is a kind of major shirk which puts one beyond the pale of Islam.\nOr such as those who make fun of religion or who liken Allah to His creation, or say that there is another creator, provider or controller besides Allah. All of these are major shirk and a grave sin that is not forgiven.\nShirk may sometimes take the form of actions\nSuch as one who sacrifices, prays or prostrates to something other than Allah, or who promulgates laws to replace the rulings of Allah and makes that the law to which people are obliged to refer for judgement; or one who supports the kafirs and helps them against the believers, and other acts that go against the basic meaning of faith and put the one who does them beyond the pale of Islam. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\nMinor shirk\nThis includes everything that may lead to major shirk, or which is described in the texts as being shirk, but does not reach the extent of being major shirk.\nThis is usually of two types:\n1 – Being emotionally attached to some means which have no basis and  for which Allah has not given permission, such as hanging up “hands”, turquoise beads etc on the grounds that they offer protection or that they ward off the evil eye. But Allah has not made them the means of such protection, either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe.\n[Translator’s note: the “hands” referred to are objects made of metal, pottery etc, usually blue or turquoise in colour, that some people hang up to ward off the evil eye, according to their mistaken belief]\n2 – Venerating some people or things in a way that does not go so far as ascribing lordship to them, such as swearing by something other than Allah, or saying, “Were it not for Allah and So and So,” etc.\nGuidelines to distinguish major shirk from minor shirk\nThe scholars have stipulated guidelines to distinguish\nmajor shirk from minor shirk\nwhen shirk is mentioned in the texts of shari’ah. These guidelines include the following:\n1 – When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) states clearly that this action is minor shirk, such as in al-Musnad (27742) where it is narrated that Mahmud ibn Labid said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The thing that I fear most for you is minor shirk.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is minor shirk?” He said: “Showing off, for Allah will say on the Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom you were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find with them.’” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 951)\n2 – When the word shirk is used in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah in the indefinite form [without the definite article al-]. This usually refers to minor shirk, and there are many examples of this, such as when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Incantations, amulets and love spells are shirk.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3883; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 331)\nWhat is meant by shirk here is minor shirk, not major shirk.\nAmulets\nare things that are hung on children such as turquoise beads and the like, which they claim will protect them from the evil eye.\nLove spells are something that they do, claiming that it will make a woman beloved to her husband and a man beloved to his wife.\n3 – If the Sahabah understood from the texts of Shari’ah that what was meant by shirk here was minor shirk, not major. Undoubtedly the understanding of the Sahabah carries weight, because they are the most knowledgeable of the people concerning the religion of Allah, and the most knowledgeable as to the intent of the Lawgiver.\nFor example, Abu Dawud (3910) narrated from Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (superstitious belief in omens) is shirk, tiyarah is shirk,” three times, and there is no one among us but (will have some of that) but Allah will rid him of it by means of tawakkul (putting his trust in Allah). The words “there is no one among us…” are the words of Ibn Mas’ud, as was explained by the prominent scholars of hadith. This indicates that Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) understood that this was minor shirk, because he could not have said, “There is no one among us…” referring to major shirk. Moreover, major shirk cannot be eliminated by means of tawakkul, rather it is essential to repent therefrom.\n4 – If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) interpreted the words shirk or kufr in a manner which indicates that what is meant is a minor form thereof and not the major form.\nFor example al-Bukhari (1038) and Muslim (74) narrated from Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led the morning prayer for us at al-Hudaybiyah following rainfall during the night. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished, he turned to face the people and said to them: “Do you know what your Lord has said?” They said: “Allah and his Messenger know best.” He said: “This morning one of My slaves became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by the grace of Allah and His mercy,’ that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the stars; and as for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by such-and-such a star, that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the stars.’”\nThe interpretation of the word\nkufr\nhere is given in another report narrated from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not know what your Lord said? ‘I do not send any blessing upon My slaves but a group among them become kafirs thereby because they refer to the stars and attribute things to the stars.'\" This explains that if a person attributes rainfall to the stars by believing that they caused it to fall – when in fact Allah has not made the stars a means of causing rainfall – his kufr is a kind of ingratitude for the blessing of Allah. It is well known that ingratitude for the blessing of Allah is minor kufr. But if a person believes that the stars are controlling the universe and they are the ones that cause the rain to fall, then this is major shirk.\nTypes of minor shirk\nMinor shirk may sometimes take the form of outward actions, such as wearing talismans, strings, amulets and the like, and other words and deeds. And sometimes it may be hidden, like a little bit of showing off.\nIt may also take the form of beliefs:\nSuch as the belief that something may be a cause of bringing benefit or warding off harm, when Allah has not made it so; or believing that there is barakah (blessing) in a thing, when Allah has not made it so.\nIt sometimes takes the form of words:\nSuch as when they said, “We have been given rain by such and such a star,” without believing that the stars could independently cause rain to fall; or swearing by something other than Allah, without believing in venerating the thing sworn by or regarding it as equal with Allah; or saying, “Whatever Allah wills and you will,” and so on.\nIt sometimes takes the form of actions:\nSuch as hanging up amulets or wearing a talisman or string to dispel or ward off calamity, because everyone who attributes powers to a thing when Allah has not made it so either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe, has associated something with Allah. This also applies to one who touches a thing seeking its barakah (blessing), when Allah has not created any barakah in it, such as kissing the doors of the mosques, touching their thresholds, seeking healing from their dust, and other such actions.\nThis is a brief look at the division of shirk into major and minor. We cannot go into great detail in this short answer.\nTips for Muslims to avoid shirk\nWhat the Muslim must do is to avoid shirk in both its minor and major forms.\nThe greatest sin is shirk\nand transgression against the unique rights of Allah, which are (for Him) to be worshipped and obeyed Alone, with no partner or associate.\nHence Allah has decreed that the mushrikin will abide forever in Hell and has told us that He will not forgive them, and He has forbidden Paradise to them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin” [al-Nisa 4:48]\n“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers” [al-Maidah 5:72]\nEvery wise and religiously-committed person should fear shirk for himself and should turn to his Lord, asking Him to help him avoid shirk, as al-Khalil [Ibrahim – peace be upon him] said:\n“and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols”\n[Ibrahim 14:35 – interpretation of the meaning]\nOne of the salaf said: “Who can claim to be safe from this after Ibrahim?”\nSo the sincere believer’s fear of shirk should increase as should his desire for his Lord to keep him away from it, and he should say the great du’a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to his Companions when he said to them: “Shirk among you will be more subtle than the footsteps of an ant, but I will teach you something which, if you do it, both minor and major shirk will be kept away from you. Say: Allahumma inni a'udhu bika an ushrika bika wa ana a’lam wa astaghfiruka lima la a’lam (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from associating anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for that of which I am unaware).” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 3731)\nDifference between major and minor shirk in terms of ruling\nThe above refers to the difference between major and minor shirk, defining each and describing its types.\nWith regard to the difference between them as far as the ruling is concerned:\nMajor shirk puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, so the one who does that is judged to be out of Islam and to have apostatized therefrom, so he is a kafir and an apostate.\nMinor shirk does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam, rather it may be done by a Muslim but he still remains in Islam; but the one who does that is in great danger because minor shirk is a major sin. Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If I were to swear by Allah falsely, that is better for me than if I were to swear by something other than Him sincerely.” So he regarded swearing by something other than Allah (which is minor shirk) as being worse than swearing by Allah falsely, and it is well known that swearing by Allah falsely is a major sin.\nWe ask Allah to make our hearts steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him, and we seek refuge in His Might – may He be glorified – from going astray, for He is the Ever-Living Who never dies, but the jinn and mankind will die. And Allah knows best and is most wise, and to Him is the final return of all.\nAnd Allah knows best.",

We say – And Allah is the Source of strength and true guidance comes from Him:\nLexical meaning of shirk\nKnow – may Allah guide you – that the word shirk in Arabic means taking a partner, i.e., regarding someone as the partner of another. It is said [in Arabic]: ashraka baynahuma (he joined them together) when he regarded them as two of equal status; or ashraka fi amrihi ghayrahu (he introduced another into his affair) when he made two people involved in it.\nMeaning of shirk in Shari`ah teminology\nIn terms of shari’ah or Islamic terminology,\nshirk\nmeans ascribing a partner or rival to Allah in Lordship (rububiyyah), worship or in His names and attributes.\nA rival is a peer or counterpart. Hence Allah forbids setting up rivals with Him and He condemns those who take them (rivals) as gods instead of or besides Allah in many verses of the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)” [al-Baqarah 2:22]\n“And they set up rivals to Allah, to mislead (men) from His path! Say: ‘Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!’” [Ibrahim 14:30]\nIn the hadith, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies claiming that Allah has a rival, will enter Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4497; Muslim, 92.\nTypes of shirk\nThe texts of the Quran and Sunnah indicate that shirk and the ascribing of rivals to Allah sometimes puts a person beyond the pale of Islam and sometimes does not. Hence the scholars divided shirk into two types which they call shirk akbar (major shirk) and shirk asghar (\nminor shirk\n). There follows a brief description of each type:\nMajor shirk\nThis means ascribing to someone other than Allah something that belongs only to Allah, such as Lordship (rububiyyah), divinity (uluhiyyah) and the divine names and attributes (al-asma’ wa’l-sifat).\nThis kind of shirk may sometimes be outward, such as the shirk of those who worship idols and graves, or the dead or absent.\nOr it may sometimes be hidden, such as those who put their trust in other gods besides Allah, or the shirk and kufr of the hypocrites. For even though  their (hypocrites’) shirk puts them beyond the pale of Islam and means that they will abide  forever in Hell, it is a hidden shirk, because they make an outward display of Islam and conceal their kufr and shirk, so they are inwardly mushriks but not outwardly.\nTypes of major shirk\nShirk may sometimes take the form of beliefs\nSuch as the belief that there is someone else who creates, gives life and death, reigns or controls the affairs of the universe along with Allah.\nOr the belief that there is someone else who must be obeyed absolutely besides Allah, so they follow him in regarding as permissible or forbidden whatever he wants, even if that goes against the religion of the Messengers.\nOr they may associate others with Allah in love and veneration, by loving a created being as they love Allah. This is the kind of shirk that Allah does not forgive, and it is the shirk of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals(to Allah). They love them as they love Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:165]\nOr the belief that there are those who know the Unseen as well as Allah. This is very common among some of the deviant sects such as the Rafidis (Shi’ah), extreme Sufis, and Batinis (esoteric sects) in general. The Rafidis believe that their imams have knowledge of the unseen, and the Batinis and Sufis believe similar things about their awliya (“saints”), and so on. It is also shirk to believe that there is someone who bestows mercy in a manner that is befitting only for Allah, so he shows mercy as Allah does and forgives sins and overlooks the bad deeds of his worshippers.\nShirk may sometimes take the form of words\nSuch as those who make du’a or pray to someone other than Allah, or seek his help or seek refuge with him with regard to matters over which no one has control except Allah, whether the person called upon is a prophet, a wali (“saint”), an angel or a jinn, or some other created being. This is a kind of major shirk which puts one beyond the pale of Islam.\nOr such as those who make fun of religion or who liken Allah to His creation, or say that there is another creator, provider or controller besides Allah. All of these are major shirk and a grave sin that is not forgiven.\nShirk may sometimes take the form of actions\nSuch as one who sacrifices, prays or prostrates to something other than Allah, or who promulgates laws to replace the rulings of Allah and makes that the law to which people are obliged to refer for judgement; or one who supports the kafirs and helps them against the believers, and other acts that go against the basic meaning of faith and put the one who does them beyond the pale of Islam. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.\nMinor shirk\nThis includes everything that may lead to major shirk, or which is described in the texts as being shirk, but does not reach the extent of being major shirk.\nThis is usually of two types:\n1 – Being emotionally attached to some means which have no basis and  for which Allah has not given permission, such as hanging up “hands”, turquoise beads etc on the grounds that they offer protection or that they ward off the evil eye. But Allah has not made them the means of such protection, either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe.\n[Translator’s note: the “hands” referred to are objects made of metal, pottery etc, usually blue or turquoise in colour, that some people hang up to ward off the evil eye, according to their mistaken belief]\n2 – Venerating some people or things in a way that does not go so far as ascribing lordship to them, such as swearing by something other than Allah, or saying, “Were it not for Allah and So and So,” etc.\nGuidelines to distinguish major shirk from minor shirk\nThe scholars have stipulated guidelines to distinguish\nmajor shirk from minor shirk\nwhen shirk is mentioned in the texts of shari’ah. These guidelines include the following:\n1 – When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) states clearly that this action is minor shirk, such as in al-Musnad (27742) where it is narrated that Mahmud ibn Labid said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The thing that I fear most for you is minor shirk.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is minor shirk?” He said: “Showing off, for Allah will say on the Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom you were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find with them.’” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 951)\n2 – When the word shirk is used in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah in the indefinite form [without the definite article al-].

    "question": "Do Bad Deeds Erase Good Deeds in Islam?",
    "answer": "Table Of Contents\nDisbelief and its Impact on Good Deeds\nDo Sins Erase Good Deeds in Islam?\nThe Fear of Hypocrisy and Losing Good Deeds\nDisbelief and its Impact on Good Deeds\nOne of the basic principles among Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that good deeds are not accepted if they are accompanied by disbelief, and that nothing cancels out all good deeds except disbelief.\nThis is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say: Spend (in the Cause of Allah) willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).}\n{And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad), and that they came not to As-Salah (the prayer) except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.} [At-Tawbah 9:53-54]\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNothing cancels out good deeds except disbelief, because the one who dies as a believer will inevitably enter Paradise, and he will be brought out of Hell if he does enter it, but if all his good deeds are cancelled out, he will never enter Paradise. Good deeds can only be cancelled out by that which is their opposite, and nothing can be the opposite of all good deeds except disbelief. This is well known from the principles of Sunnah. (End quote from  As-Sarim Al-Maslul, p. 55)\nThe followers of innovation, such as the Khawarij, Mu`tazilah and Murji’ah differed. The Khawarij and Mu`tazilah went to extremes and said that\nmajor sins erase and cancel out all good deeds\nand acts of worship. In contrast, the Murji’ah said that the good deed of faith cancels out all bad deeds.\nDo Sins Erase Good Deeds in Islam?\nOnce it is understood that nothing can cancel out all good deeds except that which cancels out faith altogether, namely disbelief, then can some sins cancel out and erase some good deeds?\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (10/638):\nIf bad deeds do not cancel out all good deeds, can they cancel out a proportional amount of them, or can some good deeds be erased by sin that is less than disbelief?\nThere are two views among those who claim adherence to the Sunnah, some who deny that and some who affirm it. End quote.\nThe first view is that bad deeds do not cancel out good deeds, rather good deeds are the ones that cancel out bad deeds, by the grace and bounty and kindness of Allah.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jami` li Ahkam Al-Quran (3/295):\nThe correct `Aqidah is that bad deeds do not cancel out good deeds. (End quote)\nThe second view is that sins and innovations may cancel out the reward for good deeds as a form of punishment. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah attributed this view in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (10/322) to the majority of Ahl As-Sunnah.\nThis was also the view favored by Shaykh Al-Islam and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim. He said in Madarij As-Salikin (1/278):\nAhmad stated that in one report and said: A person should get married if he fears for himself; he should borrow money and get married, lest he fall into haram actions which would cancel out his good deeds. (End quote)\nThe Fear of Hypocrisy and Losing Good Deeds\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Kitab Al-Iman (the Book of Faith) in his Sahih:\nChapter: Fear of the believer inadvertently cancelling out his good deeds. Ibrahim At-Taymi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When I compare my words with my deeds, I am afraid that my deeds belie my words. Ibn Abu Mulaykah said: I met thirty of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all of whom feared that they might be guilty of hypocrisy, and not one of them said that his faith was like that of Jibreel and Mika’eel. It was narrated from Al-Hasan: No one fears it (hypocrisy) but a believer and no one feels safe from it but a hypocrite. And one should be afraid of persisting in hypocrisy and sin\nwithout repenting\n, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {and [they] do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.} [Al `Imran 3:135]\nImam Muslim also entitled a chapter: The believer’s fear of his good deeds being cancelled out.\nImam Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Bukhari’s title for this chapter is suited to what is mentioned in it of good deeds being cancelled out by some sins, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not.} [Al-Hujurat 49:2]\nImam Ahmad said: Al-Hasan ibn Musa said: Hammad ibn Salamah narrated from Habib ibn Ash-Shahid, that Al-Hasan said: These people do not think that some deeds can cancel out others, but Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Raise not your voices …, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not,} [Al-Hujurat 49:2]\nThis is also indicated by the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.} [Al-Baqarah 2:264]\n{Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so that it is burnt? Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) to you that you may give thought.} [Al-Baqarah 2:266]\nAl-Bukhari  (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the people about it and they said: Allah knows best. Ibn `Abbas said: The verse gives a likeness of deeds. ‘Umar said: What deeds? Ibn `Abbas said: Deeds. ‘Umar said: A rich man may strive in obedience of Allah, then Allah sends the shaytan to him and he commits sins until they drown out his good deeds.\n`Ata’ Al-Khursani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is a man whose deeds end with polytheism or a\nmajor sin\n, so all his good deeds are cancelled out.\nIt is narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not pray `Asr, his deeds are cancelled out.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 553)\nIt also says in As-Sahih that a man said: By Allah, Allah will not forgive So and so.

    "detailedExplanation": "Table Of Contents\nDisbelief and its Impact on Good Deeds\nDo Sins Erase Good Deeds in Islam?\nThe Fear of Hypocrisy and Losing Good Deeds\nDisbelief and its Impact on Good Deeds\nOne of the basic principles among Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that good deeds are not accepted if they are accompanied by disbelief, and that nothing cancels out all good deeds except disbelief.\nThis is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{Say: Spend (in the Cause of Allah) willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).}\n{And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad), and that they came not to As-Salah (the prayer) except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.} [At-Tawbah 9:53-54]\nIbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nNothing cancels out good deeds except disbelief, because the one who dies as a believer will inevitably enter Paradise, and he will be brought out of Hell if he does enter it, but if all his good deeds are cancelled out, he will never enter Paradise. Good deeds can only be cancelled out by that which is their opposite, and nothing can be the opposite of all good deeds except disbelief. This is well known from the principles of Sunnah. (End quote from  As-Sarim Al-Maslul, p. 55)\nThe followers of innovation, such as the Khawarij, Mu`tazilah and Murji’ah differed. The Khawarij and Mu`tazilah went to extremes and said that\nmajor sins erase and cancel out all good deeds\nand acts of worship. In contrast, the Murji’ah said that the good deed of faith cancels out all bad deeds.\nDo Sins Erase Good Deeds in Islam?\nOnce it is understood that nothing can cancel out all good deeds except that which cancels out faith altogether, namely disbelief, then can some sins cancel out and erase some good deeds?\nShaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (10/638):\nIf bad deeds do not cancel out all good deeds, can they cancel out a proportional amount of them, or can some good deeds be erased by sin that is less than disbelief?\nThere are two views among those who claim adherence to the Sunnah, some who deny that and some who affirm it. End quote.\nThe first view is that bad deeds do not cancel out good deeds, rather good deeds are the ones that cancel out bad deeds, by the grace and bounty and kindness of Allah.\nAl-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jami` li Ahkam Al-Quran (3/295):\nThe correct `Aqidah is that bad deeds do not cancel out good deeds. (End quote)\nThe second view is that sins and innovations may cancel out the reward for good deeds as a form of punishment. Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah attributed this view in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (10/322) to the majority of Ahl As-Sunnah.\nThis was also the view favored by Shaykh Al-Islam and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim. He said in Madarij As-Salikin (1/278):\nAhmad stated that in one report and said: A person should get married if he fears for himself; he should borrow money and get married, lest he fall into haram actions which would cancel out his good deeds. (End quote)\nThe Fear of Hypocrisy and Losing Good Deeds\nImam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Kitab Al-Iman (the Book of Faith) in his Sahih:\nChapter: Fear of the believer inadvertently cancelling out his good deeds. Ibrahim At-Taymi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When I compare my words with my deeds, I am afraid that my deeds belie my words. Ibn Abu Mulaykah said: I met thirty of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all of whom feared that they might be guilty of hypocrisy, and not one of them said that his faith was like that of Jibreel and Mika’eel. It was narrated from Al-Hasan: No one fears it (hypocrisy) but a believer and no one feels safe from it but a hypocrite. And one should be afraid of persisting in hypocrisy and sin\nwithout repenting\n, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {and [they] do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.} [Al `Imran 3:135]\nImam Muslim also entitled a chapter: The believer’s fear of his good deeds being cancelled out.\nImam Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said:\nAl-Bukhari’s title for this chapter is suited to what is mentioned in it of good deeds being cancelled out by some sins, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak aloud to him in talk as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not.} [Al-Hujurat 49:2]\nImam Ahmad said: Al-Hasan ibn Musa said: Hammad ibn Salamah narrated from Habib ibn Ash-Shahid, that Al-Hasan said: These people do not think that some deeds can cancel out others, but Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Raise not your voices …, lest your deeds should be rendered fruitless while you perceive not,} [Al-Hujurat 49:2]\nThis is also indicated by the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n{O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.} [Al-Baqarah 2:264]\n{Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein, while he is stricken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so that it is burnt? Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) to you that you may give thought.} [Al-Baqarah 2:266]\nAl-Bukhari  (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the people about it and they said: Allah knows best.

    "question": "Paradise and Hell exist and they will abide so long as Allah wills them to abide",
    "answer": "The scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed that Paradise and Hell are two created things that exist at present. None of them doubt that because of the volume of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah which indicates that.\nFrom the Quran:\nAllah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n“[Paradise] prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:133]\n“Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers”[al-Hadeed 57:21]\n“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him [Jibreel (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time).\nNear Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass).\nNear it is the Paradise of Abode”[al-Najm 53:13-15]\nAllah says concerning Hell (interpretation of the meaning):\n“prepared for the disbelievers”[al-Baqarah 2:24]\nThe word prepared indicates that they exist at present.\nFrom the Sunnah:\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Sidrat al-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass), by which he saw the Paradise of Abode, as it says in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (336) and Saheeh Muslim (237) who narrated the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) which tells the story of the Isra’ (Prophet’s Night Journey). At the end of this hadeeth it says: “Jibraa’eel took me until we reached Sidrat al-Muntaha, which was covered with colours, I do not know what they are. Then I entered Paradise and saw that its domes were pearls and its soil was musk.”\nIn al-Bukhaari (1290) and Muslim (5111) it is narrated from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you dies, he is shown his place morning and evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is your abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”\nAccording to the lengthy hadeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib, “A voice will call out from heaven, ‘My slave spoke the truth, so provide him with furnishings from Paradise and open for him a door to Paradise so that its fragrant breeze may reach him.’” This is a saheeh hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (4/337) and by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (59).\nIn Saheeh al-Bukhaari (993) and Saheeh Muslim (1512), it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)… and he said: ‘I saw Paradise and I reached out for a bunch of its fruits. If I had managed to take it you would have eaten from it for as long as the earth remains. And I saw Hell, and I have never seen anything more terrifying than it…”\nIn Saheeh Muslim (646) it is narrated from the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One is Whose hand is my soul, if you had seen what I have seen, you would laugh little and weep much.” They said,  “What have you seen, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “I have seen Paradise and Hell.”\nIn Sunan al-Tirmidhi (2483) and elsewhere it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “When Allah created Paradise and Hell, he sent Jibreel to Paradise and said, ‘Look at it and at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ So he went and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared for its people therein. Then he went back to Him and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one will hear of it but he will enter it.’ Then He commanded that it should be surrounded with difficult things. Then He said, ‘Go back and look at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ He went back and saw that it was surrounded with difficult things. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will enter it.’ Allah said, ‘Go and look at Hell and see what I have prepared for its people therein.’  [He saw it] with parts of it consuming other parts. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.’ So Allah commanded that it should be surrounded with desires.

    "detailedExplanation": "The scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed that Paradise and Hell are two created things that exist at present. None of them doubt that because of the volume of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah which indicates that.\nFrom the Quran:\nAllah says (interpretation of the meanings):\n“[Paradise] prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:133]\n“Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers”[al-Hadeed 57:21]\n“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him [Jibreel (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time).\nNear Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass).\nNear it is the Paradise of Abode”[al-Najm 53:13-15]\nAllah says concerning Hell (interpretation of the meaning):\n“prepared for the disbelievers”[al-Baqarah 2:24]\nThe word prepared indicates that they exist at present.\nFrom the Sunnah:\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Sidrat al-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass), by which he saw the Paradise of Abode, as it says in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (336) and Saheeh Muslim (237) who narrated the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) which tells the story of the Isra’ (Prophet’s Night Journey). At the end of this hadeeth it says: “Jibraa’eel took me until we reached Sidrat al-Muntaha, which was covered with colours, I do not know what they are. Then I entered Paradise and saw that its domes were pearls and its soil was musk.”\nIn al-Bukhaari (1290) and Muslim (5111) it is narrated from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you dies, he is shown his place morning and evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is your abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”\nAccording to the lengthy hadeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib, “A voice will call out from heaven, ‘My slave spoke the truth, so provide him with furnishings from Paradise and open for him a door to Paradise so that its fragrant breeze may reach him.’” This is a saheeh hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (4/337) and by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (59).\nIn Saheeh al-Bukhaari (993) and Saheeh Muslim (1512), it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)… and he said: ‘I saw Paradise and I reached out for a bunch of its fruits. If I had managed to take it you would have eaten from it for as long as the earth remains. And I saw Hell, and I have never seen anything more terrifying than it…”\nIn Saheeh Muslim (646) it is narrated from the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One is Whose hand is my soul, if you had seen what I have seen, you would laugh little and weep much.” They said,  “What have you seen, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “I have seen Paradise and Hell.”\nIn Sunan al-Tirmidhi (2483) and elsewhere it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “When Allah created Paradise and Hell, he sent Jibreel to Paradise and said, ‘Look at it and at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ So he went and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared for its people therein. Then he went back to Him and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one will hear of it but he will enter it.’ Then He commanded that it should be surrounded with difficult things. Then He said, ‘Go back and look at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ He went back and saw that it was surrounded with difficult things. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will enter it.’ Allah said, ‘Go and look at Hell and see what I have prepared for its people therein.’  [He saw it] with parts of it consuming other parts. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.’ So Allah commanded that it should be surrounded with desires. Then he said, ‘Go back to it.’ So he went back, then he said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will be saved from it and that all will enter it.’” Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (6/320): its isnaad is qawiy (strong).\nAnd there are very many ahaadeeth on this topic. In his Saheeh, al-Bukhaari wrote a chapter entitled Baab ma jaa’a fi Sifat al-Jannah wa annaha makhlooqah (Chapter on what was narrated concerning the description of Paradise and the fact that it has already been created), in which he listed ahaadeeth, such as the one quoted above, which say that Allah shows the dead person his place in Paradise or Hell after he has been placed in his grave.\nAll that remains for a person to do is to strive his utmost in worshipping his Lord and refraining from disobeying Him, in the hope that He may attain the victory of being admitted to Paradise and being saved from the painful torment.
