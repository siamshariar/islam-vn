The desire to achieve\n Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all\nother desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on\nwealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of\nmaking it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of\ndevotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on\npleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One\nmust remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.\nTo be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams\nand realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!\nUltimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate\ngoal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. \nParadise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of\nGod, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence\nof pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is\nan abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel\nthe least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally\nrealized.\nIslamic Gardens\nJannah\n(a\nbeautiful garden) has historically inspired beauty, something which ca"

In order\nto enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,\nand vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise\n“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most\nable to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and\nstrength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose\ntheir youth.”\nThe faithful will enter Paradise in the best and\nmost perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their\neternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.\nThe faithful will enjoy specially crafted\nmaidens, or\nhouris\n, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of\nmortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,\nand inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public\nview in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of\ngratification.\nVision of Allah\nIn heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly\nand distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through"

It describes a state of awareness of Allah in everything one\ndoes.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\nRemembrance of Allah\nAlmost every person in the\nmodern world is involved in some basic worldly activity like earning a living,\ngoing to school, eating, sleeping, and socializing.  Naturally, we forget Allah\nand the obligations due to Him.  When we forget Allah, this life and its\nworries become the central occupation of the human mind.  Desires run wild.  A\nperson begins to ‘chase his shadow’, something he can never catch.  For many,\nmoney becomes the sole goal of life.  The more you make, the more you spend,\nthe more you want.\nAllah has set times to break\nregularly from the daily chores of life for a few minutes and worship Him.  First\nthing in the morning before we begin our day, in the middle of the day, in the\nlate afternoon, in the evening, and at night before we go to sleep.  When done\nwith concentration and properly, it awakens and stimulates the soul.  A Muslim\nreminds himself that Allah is in charge of everything, he is Allah’s faithful\nservant, and Allah’s pleasure is His aim.  For a few minutes, five times a day,\na Muslim leaves this world and meets  His Lord:\n“And establish the prayers (\nsalah\n)\nin order to remember Me.” (Quran 20:14)\nTaqwa\n(God-consciousness)\nThe prayers (\nsalah\n) also\nmakes a person God-conscious.  When a person prays five times a day, he becomes\naccustomed to feeling the presence of God and develops the sense that Allah is watching\nHim at all times.  He is never hidden from Allah, even when alone.  A sense of\nGod-consciousness keeps the heart suspended between fear and hope.  Fear of\nAllah keeps a Muslim away from the prohibited and encourages him to do the\nobligatory; a mix of divine love and devout reverence that keeps him\nreligiously observant. Regular performance of the prayers increases one’s awareness\nof Allah.\nSeeking Forgiveness\nTo err is human, and even the\nmost pious of Muslims sin and need to repent.  We all need to constantly ask\nfor Allah’s forgiveness and try our best not to repeat our mistakes.  Without\nregular contact with Allah, a person is unlikely to feel guilty for his sins\nand repent.  Sometimes if a person has not asked Allah to forgive him in a long\ntime, he might become insensitive to sinning and may even forget that he fell\ninto it, thus not even seeking forgiveness for it.  Certain prayers in the formal\nprayers (\nsalah\n) reminds the Muslim of his sins and makes him seek\nforgiveness for them  This in turn causes Muslims to feel guilty for their sins\nand seek repentance as soon as they are committed. A Muslim learns to constantly\nseeks forgiveness for his sins and never feels too distant from his loving Lord.  \nThe prayer places man directly before Allah seeking pardon for his short-comings.\nThe prayer itself is a means of\nerasing sins, albeit the lesser ones\n[1]\n.\nMessenger of Allah, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked:\n“What do you think if\nthere was a river by the door of any one of you and he bathed in it five times\na day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?”\nThey (his companions) said,\n“No trace of dirt would be left on him.”\nThe Prophet said, “This is\nlike the five daily prayers, through which Allah erases sin.” (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nControl and Discipline\nThe prayer has the capacity to\ncatalyze change for the better in people’s life.  The fact that we give up\nwhatever we are doing and line up behind a prayer leader (called\nimam\n) five\ntimes a day in the mosque, or find room to pray in at work or school by\nourselves, instills discipline in life.  People join the army to learn\ndiscipline and everyone admires it.  Similarly, the prayer trains us to go\nthrough specific motions and utter special words at specific times.  All the\nbody parts are under control, obeying and worshipping Allah, and if this\ndiscipline is broken, the prayer may have to be repeated.\nIslam recognizes that we are all\ndifferent, so it allows flexibility in many cases.  The prayer leader (\nimam\n)\nshould keep the prayer short.  Women are not required to attend the prayers in\nthe mosque.  A sick person may pray sitting, and if unable, he may even pray\nlaying down.  The discipline learned in the prayer is to be acquired in other\naspects of one’s religious and mundane life as well.  Just as we should not\nlook around when praying, we should control our eyes outside of the prayer not\nto fall on forbidden objects.  Just like we use our tongue to prai"

Those and\nother similar questions have been asked by people as long\nas human life has existed.  It is expressed by someone, somewhere all the time. \nIt is expressed in many different forms, such as What should I do?,\nWhy are we here?, What is life all about?, and\nWhat is the purpose of existence? and even Does life exist at\nall?  In the great scheme of things Muslims are in a very privileged position\nbecause when these existential questions pop into our minds we are able to\ncomprehend the answer.\nThe reason that we (humankind) are here, on this tiny\nplanet spinning in a seemingly infinite universe, is to worship Allah and Allah\nAlone.   This is the purpose for which we were created.  It is not a secret or\na mystery nor is it an enigma or a puzzle.   Finding the meaning of life is\npossible with only one thing, a desire to fulfil Allah’s plan.  There is no\nneed for hours or months or years of searching and yearning.\n“And I (Allah) created not the\njinn\nand humankind,\nexcept to worship Me (Alone).” (Quran 51:56)\n“Oh humankind, worship Allah, you have no other Allah but\nHim.” (Quran 7:59)\nHowever it is important to understand that Allah is not\nin need of human worship.  If not a single human worshipped Allah, it would not\ndiminish His glory in any way, and if all of humankind worshipped Him, it would\nnot increase His glory in any way.\n[1]\n“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes\nyou, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let\nbelievers put their trust. (Quran 3:160)\nO humankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but\nAllah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise. (Quran\n35:15)\nBecause we are fragile humans we need the comfort and\nsecurity of worshipping Allah.  In addition to that we will not find true\nhappiness and contentment until we at the very least attempt to fulfil our\npurpose in life.  The purpose of our existence is more meaningful than being\nslaves to the\ndunya\n.  Allah states that the reality of this\ndunya\nis full of deception and warns us not to fall for its temporary enjoyments.  We\nshould focus on our purpose in life in order to secure our place in the\nAkhirah.\nIn a\nhadith\nProphet Muhammad tells us that,\n“Allah says, 'Son of Adam, fill your time with my worship and I will fill your\nheart with richness, and end your poverty.  But if you do not, I will make your\nhands busy (in\ndunya\naffairs) and I would not end your poverty.’”\n[2]\nThe religion of Islam explains our purpose plainly,\nwhilst giving us clear guidelines to follow in order to make our worship easier\nand more fulfilling.  Everything is explained in the Quran and the\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad.  They are our guide books for a life full of purpose and\ncontentment.    They are the only means to true happiness but this however does\nnot mean that we will not be tried and tested.   Allah states very clearly in\nQuran that He will test us.\n“He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of\nyou is best in deed...” (Quran 67:1-2)\nOf course the life of a human being can be filled with\nplay and pleasure, but this is not the purpose of our lives.  Allah says in the\nQuran that we were indeed created for a purpose beyond that of mere delight and\nenjoyment.  The reality of life is that we will be resurrected to account for\nevery detail of our lives.\n“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any\npurpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?” (Quran 23:115)\nOne of the easiest ways to have the best of everything\nis to worship Allah in everything that we do.  Islam makes this easy.  It is as\nsimple as following the guidelines set out for us.  To remember Allah at every\nopportunity and to conduct our lives knowing that Allah is watching us, and\nangels are recording our every move.  By worshipping Allah we are doing ourselves\na favour.  When we are God-conscious we act in an upright manner and stay away\nfrom being evil and oppressing others.  And we also know that the laws of Islam\nare designe"

True justice should\nestablish an equilibrium by way of fulfilling rights and obligations and by\neliminating excess and disparity in all spheres of life.  The standard of\njustice in the Quran is referred to in some fifty passages.  People are urged\nto be just to others at all levels, whether personal or public, in words or in\nconduct, in dealing with friends or enemies, Muslim or non-Muslim, all must be\ntreated with justice.  Allah says in the Quran,\n“We sent Our messengers with evidences and revealed the Book\nand the balance through them so as to establish justice among people…” (Quran\n57:25)\n6.\nShari"

    "fullText": "Objective\n·To understand why the three sacred cities\nare important\n.\nArabic Terms\n·\nMasjid\n- the Arabic term for mosque.\n·\nSahabah\n- the plural form of “Sahabi,”\nwhich translates to Companions.   A\nsahabi\n, as the word is commonly used\ntoday, is someone who saw Prophet Muhammad, believed in him and died as a\nMuslim.\n·\nKabah\n- The cube-shaped\nstructure located in the city of Mecca.   It serves as a focal point towards\nwhich all Muslims face when praying.\n·\nHajj\n- A pilgrimage to Mecca where\nthe pilgrim performs a set of rituals.   The\nHajj\nis one of the five\npillars of Islam, which every adult Muslim must undertake at least once in\ntheir life if they can afford it and are physically able.\n·\nQiblah\n- The direction one faces\nduring the formal prayers.\nOne of the\nsahabah\nonce asked Prophet Muhammad\nwhich was the first\nmasjid\nbuilt on earth.  He replied, “The Sacred Mosque\nin Mecca”.  “Which was next?” the\nsahabi\nasked and the Prophet replied “Al-Aqsa\nMosque in Jerusalem”.\n[1]\nProphet Muhammad advised his followers not to prepare\nfor a religious journey except to three mosques.\n[2]\nThese three mosques are the three holiest sites in Islam\nand are situated in three sacred cities, Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.  All\nthree cities are in the Middle East, two in present day Saudi Arabia and the\nother in the Holy Land, now known as either Palestine or Israel.  In two\nlessons we will look closely at the significance of the three cities and\ndiscuss what they mean to Muslims around the globe.\nMecca\nMecca is home to the largest\nmasjid\nin the world,\nMasjid Al-Haraam\n(The Sacred Mosque).  It surrounds the\nKabah\n, a\ncube shaped structure that Muslims believe is the world’s first house of\nworship.  In the 21\nst\ncentury the\nmasjid\nhas a large outdoor\nterrace with white marble floors that reflect the bright light during the day\nand are floodlit at night.   It is a huge space that allows for the influx of\nup to 4 million people in the\nHajj\nseason.  It is a space that is always\nawake and where people from all over the globe congregate to spend their days\nand nights in worship and contemplation.   Mecca nowadays is a far cry from its\nhumble beginnings.\nThe area in which Mecca stands has been the subjects of stories\nstretching back to the very beginning of time.  Both the Quran and the Bible\nmention Mecca’s earlier name of Becca as a place of worship.  “…Blessed are\nthose whose strength is in You who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.  As\nthey pass through the valley of Becca, they make it a place of springs…”\n[3]\n“Verily the first house of worship appointed for mankind was\nat Becca…” (Quran 3:96)\nThe first Muslims prayed towards MasjidAl-Aqsa in\nJerusalem.   While in exile in Medina Prophet Muhammad received a revelation\nfrom God instructing him to turn towards the\nKabah\n.   Thus it became the\nqibla\nfor Muslims throughout the world.  The historians and scholars of\nIslam have differed on who built the\nKabah\n.  Some say that it was built\nby the angels.   Others say the father of humankind, Adam built the\nKabah\nbut over many centuries it fell into disrepair only to be rebuilt by Prophet\nIbrahim and his son Ishmael.   All agree that the\nKabah\nwas either built\nor rebuilt by Prophet Ibrahim.\n“And remember when Ibrahim and his son were raising the\nfoundations of the House (the\nKabah\nat Mecca), (saying), ‘Our Lord!\nAccept this service from us.  Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower’”\n(Quran 2:127)\nProphet Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in 570\nBCE.  At that time Mecca was an oasis on the trade routes between Yemen and the\nMediterranean Sea.  There is historical evidence indicating that goods from all\nover the known world flowed through the markets of Mecca.   And pilgrims used\nto come to visit the\nKabah.\nAt that historical point in time, it was filled\nwith statues and idols.\nEach year pilgrims travelled to Mecca and Prophet Muhammad’s\ntribe, the Quraish\n[4]\n,\nmade a very good living by trading with the pilgrims.  Muhammad’s prophethood\nput their very lucrative livelihoods into jeopardy and this was one of a\ncomplex myriad of reasons why they wrought havoc upon the Muslims and\neventually drove them from the city.\nProphet Muhammad once said of Mecca, “By Allah, you are\nthe best and the dearest of all lands of Allah to Him.  Had I not been driven\nout of you, I would have never left you.”\n[5]\nAnd, he once observed, “Allah, not the people, has made Mecca a sanctuary;\ntherefore, any person who believes in Allah and the Last Day should neither\nshed blood in it nor cut down its trees.”\n[6]\nWhen Prophet Muhammad returned to Mecca he took control\nof the city with great diplomacy, and with boundless mercy towards its\ninhabitants.  He purged the\nKabah\nof idols and the Arabian Peninsula of\nany worship except to Allah.   Mecca took its place in history as the spiritual\ncentre of Islam.\nMedina\nMedina, also in present day Saudi Arabia, is\nthe second most sacred city in Islam.  Its importance derives from the

It serves as a focal point towards which all\nMuslims face when praying.\nMedina (\ncontinued\n)\nThe second most sacred city in Islam is Medina. It\nis in the western region of Saudi Arabia in the area known as the Hejaz. Medina\nis the Arabic word for city and it is known as “the city” meaning it is the\ncity of Prophet Muhammad. It is also sometimes known as Medina Munawwarah\nmeaning the city of enlightenment.  Originally called Yathrib, Medina is the\ncity to which Prophet Muhammad and the fledgling Muslim community migrated when\nlife became too difficult in Mecca.\nThe original Prophet's Mosque was an open-air\nbuilding with a raised platform for sermons. It was a square enclosure of approximately\n30 by 35 meters and was built from palm trunks with mud walls. It could be accessed\nthrough three doors and its basic plan has since been adopted in the building\nof many other mosques throughout the world.\nThe\nMasjid\nalso contained a shaded area to the south\nand a prayer area facing north towards Jerusalem. When the\nqiblah\nwas\nchanged to Mecca, the\nMasjid\nwas re-oriented to face Mecca. This space\nalso served as a community centre, court, and school. In only seven years the\nMasjid\nspace was doubled to accommodate the ever increasing number of Muslims.\nIt is here in the\nMasjid\nthat the tomb of Prophet\nMuhammad is located. Because prophets are generally buried where they die,\nProphet Muhammad was buried in the home of his wife Aisha. This was originally\nattached to the\nMasjid\nbut in the intervening centuries the\nMasjid\nhas expanded to such a degree that even the cemetery known as Al-Baqi, once on\nthe outside of the city, now marks the outer precincts of the\nMasjid\n.  The\ngraves of some of Prophet Muhammad’s family members and many\nsahabah\nand\nearly generations of scholars can be found here.\nOne of the most significant and important reasons why\nMuslims all over the world long to visit this city filled with light and\nlearning is the fact that it has many blessings.\nThe person who offers 40 prayers consecutively in\nmy\nMasjid\n, without missing a prayer in between, will secure immunity\nfrom the fire of Hell and other torments and also from hypocrisy.\n[1]\nProphet Muhammad said, I was ordered to migrate to\na town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that\nis Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities\nof iron.” And he also said, There are angels guarding the entrances (or\nroads) of Medina, neither plague nor\nthe Dajjaal\n(Antichrist) will be\nable to enter it.”\n[2]\nMedina and its surrounds are filled with the places and\nsights that are infused with Islamic history. The site of the Battle of Badr is\napproximately 20 miles south west of Medina, and four miles north is the site\nof the Battle of Uhud. Also within a short distance is the place where the Battle\nof the Ditch was fought.  Masjid Al-Quba the first mosque built  in Islam and\nwhose foundation stone was laid by Prophet Muhammad himself can be found here\nin Medina, so too is Masjid Al-Qiblatain, the mosque built on the  site where\nthe revelation  to change the\nqiblah\ndirection came. Before this\nrevelation the first Muslims prayed facing towards Jerusalem.\nJerusalem\nThe city of Jerusalem is the third most sacred site in\nIslam. According to Islamic history, Prophet Jacob, built a\nmasjid\non\nthe Al-Aqsa site approximately 40 years after his grandfather Prophet Abraham\nbuilt the\nKabah\nin Mecca. It was later rebuilt or expanded by King\nSolomon, a man considered by Islam to also be a Prophet.\nGlorified be He Who took His slave on a journey by night from Masjid\nAl-Haraam to Masjid Al-Aqsa, the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in\norder that We might show him of Our signs.  Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the\nAll-Seer. (Quran 17:1)\nMuslims are much attached to Jerusalem because God\nrefers to it in the Quran as “the neighbourhood whereof we have blessed”.  A compound\ncalled Masjid Al-Aqsa lies within the city of Jerusalem.  The name Al-Aqsa translates\nto the farthest\nmasjid\n. However there are multiple mosques and centres\nof learning on the 144,000 square metre site including the most identifiable\nbuilding in Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock.\nThe golden shining dome stands out on the Jerusalem\nskyline and can be recognized by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. In an event\nknown as the Night Journey and Ascension, Prophet Muhammad ascended to the\nlowest heaven from a rock that is now found inside this most famous symbol.  On\nthe same journey Prophet Muh"

Through the belief and attestation of these two phrases one enters\nthe fold of Islam. It is the central belief that a believer maintains\nthroughout his life, and is the basis for all his beliefs, worship and existence\nin this world.\nEvery Muslim, including someone new to Islam, has to\nunderstand the meanings of these two phrases, and try to live his life\naccordingly.\nThe Importance of the Testimony of\nFaith\nThis Testimony is by far the most important aspect of\nthe religion of Islam, upon which the whole religion is built. Islam is the\nonly true monotheistic religion, stressing that no worship should be directed\nto any other except Allah. It is a way of life in which a person obeys and\nworships the orders of Allah and none else.\nThis Testimony of Faith (\nShahadah\n) reminds us of\nour purpose in life, which is the worship of Allah alone.  Allah says in the\nQuran:\n“And I have not created neither jinn nor humans, except to\nworship Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)\nThe message of the Oneness of God (\nTawheed\n) found\nin the Testimony was not particular to the message of Prophet Muhammad, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. It was the universal message of all\nProphets of Allah. Since the dawn of humanity, Allah sent Messengers to every\npeople and nation, commanding them to worship Him Alone, and to reject all\nfalse deities. Allah says:\n“And indeed We have raised amongst every nation a Messenger,\n[commanding them] ‘Worship Allah, and reject all false deities.” (Quran 16:36)\nThe Meaning of\nLa ilaha illa Allah\nThe meaning of each word in the\nphrase is:\nLa\n: There is no;\nilaha\n:\ngod (deity);\nilla\n: except;\nAllah\n: Allah (God)\nAnd therefore the literal\nmeaning of this phrase is “There is no god (deity) except Allah”\nFirst Part of this phrase: Rejection\n‘There is no god (deity)’… Here, god with a small case\n‘g’ is anything which is worshipped. Many people have taken things in creation\nas their gods and deities, but they are all false and are wrongfully worshipped,\nmeaning that they have no right to that worship, nor do they deserve it. This\nrejection extends to all superstitions, ideologies, ways of life, or any\nauthority figures who claim divine devotion.\nSome people imagine the Divine Kingdom of God to be like\nearthly kingdoms. Just as a king has many ministers and trusted associates,\nthey imagine ‘saints’ and minor deities to be our intercessors to God.  They\ntake them as agents through whom God is approached. In truth, there are no\nintercessors in Islam, nor any class of clergy to whom one must ‘confess’ their\nsins to be forgiven. A Muslim prays directly and exclusively to God. We also\nreject superstitious practices such as astrology, palm reading, good luck\ncharms, and fortune-telling.\nSecond Part of this phrase: Affirmation\n‘Except Allah’… After denying the right of any created\nbeing to be worshipped, the Testimony affirms divinity for Allah alone, with ‘…\nexcept\nAllah.’\nAllah, in the Quran, mentions in many places that all\nthings which people take as objects of worship besides Allah do not deserve any\nworship, nor do they have any right over it, as they themselves are creations\nand have no power to bring any benefit.\nYet they have taken besides Him other gods that created\nnothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for\nthemselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor\nof raising the dead. (Quran 25:3)\nThus,\nla ilaha illa Allah\nmeans, “There is no\ntrue\ngod except Allah” or “There is no god rightfully worshipped except Allah.”\nThe Meaning of\nMuhammad rasoolu Allah\nThe meaning of each word in the\nphrase is:\nMuhammad\n: Prophet\nMuhammad;\nrasoolu\n: Messenger;\nAllah\n: Allah (God)\nAnd therefore this phrase means,\n“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”.\nBy testifying to this fact, one affirms that Prophet\nMuhammad is in fact a Prophet and Messenger raised by God, amongst mankind to\ndeliver the message of God, as were other Prophets and Messengers. Attesting to\nthis fact implies a multitude of meanings. These include:\n1.  To believe\nthat he was the\nlast\nProphet and Messenger.\n“Muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the\nMessenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets and Allah is Ever All-Aware of\neverything” (Quran 33:40)\n2. To believe\nthat he delivered the message of Allah faithfully just as he r"

the types of\nshirk\n.\n·To learn\nshirk\nin Allah’s:\noLordship.\noNames & Attributes.\nArabic Terms\n·\nShirk\n- a word that implies ascribing\npartners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or\nbelieving that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another\nbesides Allah.\n·\nTawheed\n- The Oneness and Uniqueness\nof Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and in His\nright to be worshipped.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas several\nmeanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally\naccepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.\nIntroduction\nThe Arabic word\nshirk\n[1]\nis the opposite of\ntawheed\n, Allah’s oneness and uniqueness, and is more\ninclusive than polytheism and idolatry.\nShirk\ncontradicts the very\npurpose of creation as expressed in the Quran:\n“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship Me.”\n(Quran 51:56)\nProphets were sent with the mission to eradicate\nshirk\nand to invite humanity to single out Allah in worship.\nWhat is\nShirk\n?\nShirk\nis to associate someone other than Allah in\nthose aspects which are unique to Allah and His exclusive right.\nShirk\nis to worship created beings like Allah is worshipped, to venerate created\nbeings like Allah must be venerated, and to assign a portion of His divinity to\nsomeone else.\nSeverity of\nShirk\nThere is no issue upon which Islam is so strict as the\none of\ntawheed\n(monotheism).  Therefore,\nshirk\nis considered the\ngreatest\nviolation with which the Lord of the heavens and the earth is defied.  The\nseverity of\nshirk\ncan be summarized in the following points:\n(1)\nShirk\nmakes the Creator like His\ncreation, in that matters that are exclusive to Allah are associated with\nothers who have no right to it.  Therefore, Allah declares\nshirk\nto be\nthe greatest wrong,\n“Indeed to ascribe partners (unto Him) is a tremendous wrong.”\n(Quran 31:13)\n(2)  Allah has declared that He will not forgive\nthe sin of\nshirk\nunless the person repents from it,\n“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner should be set up\nwith Him, and forgives all besides that to whom He pleases.” (Quran 4:48)\n(3)  Allah has forbidden Paradise to those who do\nnot repent from committing\nshirk\n, condemning him to Hell for eternity,\n“Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has\nforbidden to him Paradise and his abode is the Fire.” (Quran 5:72)\n(3)  All the good works a person may have done are\nlost, become worthless, and are rendered vain if a person dies unrepentant of\nshirk\n,\n“And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those\nbefore you: if you should associate (anything) with Allah, your work would\nsurely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Quran\n39:65)\n(4)\nShirk\nis the deadliest of all major\nsins.  On one occasion, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, asked his companions if they knew what was greatest of all major sins. \nHe then explained to them,\n“The major sins are:\nshirk\n, not being kind\nto one’s parents…” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nTypes of Shirk\n(1)  Greater\nShirk\n(\nShirk\nAkbar)\n(2)  Lesser\nShirk\n(\nShirk\nAsghar)\nDefinition of Greater\nShirk\nGreater\nShirk\nis associating others with Allah in\nthose aspects which are unique to Allah in his person taking a rival or associate\nunto Allah and making it an equal to Allah.\nShirk\nin Allah Being the Lord\nThis category includes:\n(i)   Atheism (the belief that human beings have no\nLord).\nPharaoh denied the existence of Allah and claimed his\nown self to be the Lord over Moses and the people of Egypt.  He announced to\npeople:\n“I am your Lord, Most High.” (Quran 79:24)\nModern day philosophers that deny the existence of Allah\nor scientists who consider the universe created itself or has no beginning or\nend fall under this category.  Also, the idea that nature itself is God, or\nthat God dwells within His creation is also\nshirk\n.\n(b)  The belief that Allah shares His rule and\ncontrol over the creation.\nPeople who fall into this category are those who may believe\nin Allah’s powers and abilities, but also believe that Allah is several\n“persons,” that He is somehow “split” into different beings.  An example is\nChristians who believe that Allah is God the Father, God the Son, and God the\nHoly Spirit, all at the same time.  Also, Hindus believe in One God who takes\nthe forms of Brahma – the creator-god, Vishnu – the preserver-god, and Shiva –\nthe destroyer-god.  Islam teaches that Allah is One in every sense: perfect,\nindivisible, and complete.\nAnother example of this\nshirk\nis held by people\nwho pray to the dead.  They believe the souls of the saints and other people\ncan meddle in the affairs of mortal men, that somehow the departed souls can\ncause change in the life of men and women by answering their prayers or in\nother ways.  The truth"

A Muslim should not be\nattached to anything else to a level where it enslaves his heart.  Hearts get attached\nto power, money, glamour, women, music, drugs, and alcohol, to name a few.  These\nthings can become the ‘god’ in one’s life who a person chases day and night,\nand, once he gets the thing he loves, he works hard to please it.  That is why\nthe Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said a man who\nworships money will always be miserable\n[1]\nand\nthe Quran says,\n“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides\nAllah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But those who\nbelieve love Allah (more than anything else).” (Quran 2:165)\n(2)\nShirk\nin supplication.  First, supplication\nor invocation (known as\ndu’a\nin Arabic) is part of worship as the\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“Supplication is the essence of worship.” (\nAbu\nDaud, Al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad\n)\nCalling upon dead saints, righteous men or those who are\nabsent and far away for help and assistance as Allah should have been prayed to\nis greater\nshirk\n.  It includes praying, invoking or supplicating to a\nfalse deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides Allah.  Christians\npray to a man, the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, whom they claim to have been God\nincarnate.  Catholics pray to saints, angels, and Mary as the “mother of God.”  It\nis also\nshirk\nto pray to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings\nof Allah be upon him, or to deceased holy men believing that they can answer prayers,\nas Allah says,\n“Say: ‘Behold, I have been forbidden to worship those whom you\ninvoke instead of Allah.’” (Quran 6:56)\n“And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits\nyou nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.”\n(Quran 10:106)\n“If you pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they\nheard they could not grant it you.  On the Day of Resurrection they will disown\nassociation with you.  None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.” (Quran 35:14)\n(3)\nShirk\nin obedience.  Allah is the only\nRuler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver\n[2]\n,\nthe Absolute Judge, and the Legislator.  He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just\nlike the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the\nmoral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from\nwrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,\ndetermine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human\ninteraction and behavior.  His is the command:\n“His is the Creation and Command.” (7:54)\n“Legislation is not but for Allah.  He has commanded that you\nworship not except Him.  That is the correct religion, but most of the people\ndo not know.” (Quran 12:40)\nObeying religious leaders in matters of clear\ndisobedience to Allah is a form of greater\nshirk\nas Allah says:\n“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and\ntheir monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)\nThey made partners unto Allah not by directly praying to\nthem, but by willfully accepting their rabbis and clergy changing the lawful\ninto prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave\ntheir religious men the authority only Allah has - to set the divine law.  For\nexample, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church has the authority to determine\nhow God is t"

Thus the word\nriyaa\nmeans showing\noff, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically\nriyaa\nmeans to perform\nacts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than\nAllah.\nDefinition of Lesser\nShirk\nLesser\nShirk\nis what has been specifically called\nshirk\nin the Quran and\nSunnah\n, but does not reach the level of greater\nshirk\n.  \nAlso, lesser\nshirk\nis said to lead to greater\nshirk\n.   Some\nscholars have said lesser\nshirk\nis so vast that it is difficult to\ndefine it precisely.   The most important examples of lesser\nshirk\nare:\nCharms & Omens\nWearing charms, talismans, and amulets for protection\nagainst the evil eye, bad luck and the like thinking that Allah has placed\nthese powers in them constitute lesser\nshirk\n.  This is discussed in more\ndetail\nhere\n.\nSwearing an Oath in the Name of Other than Allah\nTaking an oath, or swearing, in the name of someone\nother than Allah is a type of lesser\nshirk\ngiven that a person does not\nintend to venerate the one in whose name the oath is being taken, else it turns\ninto greater\nshirk\n.   The Messenger of Allah, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said,\n“The one who takes an oath in the name of other\nthan Allah commits disbelief or\nshirk\n.”\n[1]\nRiyaa\n(Showing-Off)\nThe Messenger of Allah said:\n“The thing that I fear most for you is lesser\nshirk\n.”\nThey said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is lesser\nshirk\n?”\n He said:\n“\nRiyaa\n(showing off), for Allah will say on\nthe Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom\nyou were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find\nwith them.’” (\nAhmad\n)\nRiyaa\nis to perform worship in order to be seen\nand praised by people.\nRiyaa\nrenders a deed void; the person earns sin\ninstead of reward from Allah, and it exposes him to punishment.\nHuman beings, by nature like to be praised, are not fond\nof criticism, and do not like to be seen deficient in any way.   Islam views doing\nreligious acts to impress others instead of pleasing Allah - what should have\nbeen done for Allah is done for people - as\nshirk\n.   The Messenger of\nAllah said:\n“Allah (glorified and exalted be He) said: ‘I am so\nself-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate.  Thus he who does\nan action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action\nrenounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.’” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nThere is a good chance of a believer falling into\nriyaa\nbecause it is hidden, it sits in the heart, pollutes the intention, and a\nperson has to be extremely vigilant to correct it.  Ibn Abbas, one of the\nProphet’s companions, said,\n“\nShirk\nin the Muslim nation is more hidden\nthan a black ant crawling on a black stone in the middle of a moonless night.”\n[2]\nIntention is a simple matter, but sometimes changing it\ncan be difficult.   A person has to listen to their heart and see what motivates\na certain action.  A Muslim has to carefully watch his intention to keep it\npure whenever he performs a good deed like\nsalah\n(ritual prayer), giving\ncharity, fasting, serving his parents, or even smiling.  Perhaps this is why\nthe saying of Allah’s Name has been prescribed before all acts of importance in\ndaily life – eating, drinking, sleeping, going to the toilet, waking up, and\ngoing to sleep.  Remembering Allah keeps the heart aware of Allah and the\nintention pure.\nLet us understand with simple examples how\nriyaa\nmay affect worship:\n(a)  Let us say the basic motive when you stand up\nto pray is for people to see you, or notice you are praying, wishing to be praised. \nThis invalidates the act of worship.\n(b)  Let us say you started off to pray with\nsincerity, your intention was to pray for Allah, but then you started thinking\nabout pleasing people, and slowly your intention changed.  You do one of the\ntwo things.  If you resist the temptation of getting noticed, it will not have\nany effect on you because the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, said:\n“Allah has forgiven my ummah"

Allah.  Nothing else.  The\nProphet of Islam was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, where was our Lord before He\ncreated His creation?” He said: “Nothing existed but Him, with nothing beneath\nHim and nothing above Him.”\n[1]\nThink about how amazing that is, basically it tells us\nthat there is nothing but Allah that is truly worthy; creation needs Allah and\nnothing else because in the beginning there was Allah while there was nothing\nelse.\nAllah says in the Quran:\n“Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the Guardian\nover all things.” (Quran 39:62)\nSo everything besides Allah was created by Him, is under\nHis dominion and His disposal, and He brought it into existence.\nJubayr, a contemporary of Prophet Muhammad describes\nhimself, saying, “I was one of the greatest enemies of the Prophet,” and he\nsaid, “I hated him more than any other human being on the face of this earth,”\nbut then something strange happened.   “One time I walked into the mosque and I\nheard the Prophet reciting verses from\nSurah\nat-Toor (Quran 52:35-36),\n‘Were they created from absolutely nothing or are they themselves suggesting\nthat they are the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth?\nRather they have absolutely no idea, they are at confusion!’”\nJubayr says that at that moment when the Prophet said\nthat, even though he wouldn't officially accept Islam until later on in his life,\n“faith entered my heart.   I knew at that point that there is absolutely no way\nthat there is no God!”\nIf you just sit with yourself and you go through the\nprocess of elimination of the possibilities of how we and everything else\naround us is here, you will find that there is no other way to explain it\nexcept by Allah.\nCreation of Water and the Throne (\nArsh\n)\nProphet Muhammad said: “Nothing existed but Him,\nwith nothing beneath Him and nothing above Him.   Then He created His Throne\nabove the water.”\n[2]\nThe Prophet tells us that there was Allah first and\nnothing else.   Then, He created the water and the Throne (\nArsh\n).   They\nwere created independent of any angels and were created before the creation of the\nheavens and the earth.   Prophet Muhammad said, “There was Allah, and there was\nnothing else besides Him, and His Throne was over the wat0er.   He wrote all\nthings in the Book (in heaven) and He created the heavens and the eart0h.”\n[3]\nAll stars,\nplanets, galaxies comes under the “first heaven” (\nAs-sama ad-dunya\n).\nGod mentions many times in the Quran that He is the Lord\nof the Glorious Throne, because it is one of the foremost and most magnificent\nof his creations.\nDescription\nof the Throne\n1.  Allah Created His Throne Above Water\nAllah said, “\nAnd\nHe it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne\nwas on the water.”\n(Quran 11:7)\n2.  Throne is the Roof of Paradise\nThe Prophet said:\n“If you ask Allah, then ask him the (Paradise of)\nFirdaws\n,\nfor it is in the highest point of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the\nMost Merciful, and from it burst the rivers of Paradise.”\n[4]\n3.  Throne is Above the Heavens & Above\nAll Creation\nAbdullah Ibn Masud, a Companion of the\nProphet, said, “Between the lowest heaven and the one after it is the distance\nof five hundred years, and between every two heavens is the distance of five\nhundred years, and between the seventh heaven and the\nKursi\nis the\ndistance of five hundred years, and between the\nKursi\nand the water is\nthe distance of five hundred years, and the Throne (\nArsh\n) is above the\nwater.  Allah the Almighty is above the Throne.  And nothing is hidden from\nAllah of your deeds.”\n[5]\n4.  Throne has Pillars\nThe Prophet said:\n“The people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection\nand I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold, I will find Musa\nclinging to one of the pillars of the Throne.  Then I will not know whether he\nregained consciousness before me or he has been exempted because of his\nunconsciousness at the mountain of Toor (at Sinai).”\n[6]\n)\n5.  Angels Who Carry It\nAllah said:\n“Those\n(angels) who bear the Throne and those around it glorify the praises of their\nLord.”\n(Quran 40:7)\nHe also said:\n“And\nthe angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the\nThrone of your Lord above them.”\n(Quran 69:17)\nMoreover, Allah talks about the great angels that carry\nthe Throne.  They are huge magnificent creatures from the best of Allah’s\nangels.  On the Day of Judgement, Allah tells us there will be eight angels\nthat will bear His Throne (Quran 69:17).  The Prophet said, “I was permitted to\nspeak about one of the angels of Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, who is\none of the"

They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\nThe Pen\nAfter the creation of the water and the Throne, God\ncreated the Pen.  When the Prophet says that God created the Pen, he says that\nHis Throne was settled upon water, that there was a layer of water under the\nThrone of God.\n“God ordained the measures of the creation fifty thousand\nyears before He created the heavens and the earth while His Throne was over the\nwater.”\n[1]\nWhat are the dimensions of the Pen?  How does it look?  We\nhave absolutely no idea.\nThe Prophet said, “God said to the Pen: ‘Write.’ It\nsaid: ‘O Lord, what should I write?’ He said: ‘Write down the decrees of all\nthings until the Hour begins.’”\n[2]\nThe Preserved Tablet (\nAl-Lawh Al-Mahfuz\n)\nThe Pen, which was created 50,000 years before the\nheavens and the earth, wrote in what’s known as\nal-Lawh al-Mahfuz\n, the\nPreserved Tablet.  God calls it\nal-Lawh Al-Mahfuz\nbecause it’s protected\nfrom any changes and is also protected from access.  Everything is within that\nBook, even, as God tells us, a leaf falling from the tree.  Everything that\nwould have happened, that has happened, and will happen is written there.\nWhat it does is it establishes the trust of a believer\nin Allah that what He wrote was written for our good, and that everything\nhappens for a wisdom.  Sometimes we can figure it out, but at other times we\nare comforted and content knowing that God knows what He is doing.\nHeavens and Earth\nReferring to what scientists call the Big Bang today,\nthe Quran says,\n“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and\nthe earth were joined together as one piece, then We parted them and We have\nmade from water every living thing? Will they not then believe?”\n(Quran\n21:30)\nBased on the following verse, some scholars state that Allah\ncreated the heavens before He created the earth,\n“Are you more difficult to\ncreate or is the heaven that He constructed.  He raised its height, and has\nperfected it.  Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.  And after\nthat He spread the earth.  And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. \nAnd the mountains He has fixed firmly, as provision and benefit for you and\nyour cattle.”\n(Quran 79:27-30)\nAllah says in the Quran,\n“Indeed, your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the\nearth in six days.” (Quran 7:54)\nAllah really does not need six days, God could simply\nhave said, “Be,” and it would have come into existence.  Why would God create\nin six days as opposed to just one second or less? Perhaps, God wanted to teach\nus one of the beloved qualities to Him, which is to take things slowly and\nplanning them out properly.\nSeas, Rivers, & Rain\nAllah tells us that He is the One who created the\nheavens and the earth, sent down rain from the sky, producing fruits and\nsustenance for our survival.  Allah provided for us seas and ships to sail\nthrough these seas.  He put the rivers at our service and placed the sun and\nthe moon in their circuits.  He put for our service the night and the day.  Allah\nsays that He gave us everything that we need to survive.  If we were to try to\ncount the blessings of Allah, we would not be able to do so (see Quran\n14:32-34).\nThe earth benefits us in innumerable ways.   If you look\nat the surface of the earth, Allah says He made it special for us, meaning that\nit is ease to tread.  Now imagine if the surface of the earth was all like\nmountains and we all had to live in regions that were rough and difficult to\nwalk.  He made the surface soft so we can dig into it and plant things.  But at\nthe same time, He made the earth stable and firm enough to allow construction\nand building from its materials.  He also created gravity so we’re not just\nflying all over the place.\nSun & Moon\nThe sun is a magnificent creation of Allah and you will\nfind that Allah swears by the sun in Chapter Ash-Shams in order to bestow\ngreater appreciation for this gift that He gave us.  Many religions in the past\nassigned special qualities to the sun; a lot of people worshipped the sun.  Allah\nsays,\n“And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. \nDo not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostate to God, who created\nthem, if you [really] worship Him.” (Quran 41:37)\nWith the sun, moon, and the stars you have a lot of\nsuperstitions and even rational human beings will have these very strange\nsuperstitions.  People often put logic aside when it comes to superstitions. \nYou have astrology, horoscopes and other similar things that make absolutely no\nsense, but they give people either hope that’s not really there or they give\npeople a reason for t"

In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\nThe human mind is a true marvel, but in certain areas it\nis limited.  Allah is different from anything the human mind can think of or\nimagine.  Therefore, if the mind tries to picture Allah, certain aspects will\nbe ambiguous and open to indefinite interpretation.  Nevertheless, it is\npossible to understand the attributes of Allah which do not require making any\nmental pictures.  For example, one of Allah’s names is\nal-Ghaffar\n, which\nmeans ‘Oft-Forgiver’.  Everyone can understand this easily because that is how\nthe human mind can clearly think of Allah.  Jewish and Christian teachings on\nGod are confused partly because of their incorrect understanding of this issue. \nThe Jewish Torah teaches God is like man:\n“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image,\nafter our likeness…so God made man in His own image.’ (Genesis 1:26-27)\nMoreover, certain Christians put statues or images of an\nold white bearded man depicting God in their churches.  Some of these were  produced\nby the likes of Michelangelo, who depicted the Face and Hand ‘of God’ – a tough\nlooking old man - in paintings.\nRendering images of God in Islam is an impossibility,\nand amounts to disbelief, as Allah tells us in the Quran that nothing resembles\nHim:\n“There is nothing like Him, but He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.”\n(Quran 42:11)\n“There is nothing comparable to Him.” (Quran 112:4)\nThe Request of Moses to See Allah\nEyes can not grasp Allah, He tells us in the Quran:\n“Vision cannot grasp Him, but He his grasp is over all vision.”\n(Quran 6:103)\nMoses, to whom God spoke and gave great miracles, was\nchosen by Allah to be His Prophet.  It is said, that Moses thought that, since\nAllah used to speak to him, he might be able to actually see Allah if he asked. \nThe story is in the Quran, where Allah tells us what happened:\n“And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord\nspoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show me (Yourself) that I may look at You.’  (Allah)\nsaid, ‘You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in\nplace, then you will see Me.’  But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He\nrendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious.  And when he awoke, he said,\n‘Exalted are You!  I have repented to You, and I am the first of the\nbelievers.’” (Quran 7:143)\nAllah made it clear that no one, including the great\nprophet Moses, can bear the sight of the divine, for Allah is too great to be grasped\nby human eyes in this life.  According to the Quran, Moses realized his request\nwas in error; therefore, he sought forgiveness from Allah for having even\nthought to ask.\nThe Prophet Muhammad Did Not See Allah in This Life\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, traveled in a miraculous journey through the heavens to meet Allah. \nPeople thought that since Prophet Muhammad spoke to Allah in that journey, he\nprobably saw Allah too.  One of the companions, Abu Dharr, asked him about it. \nThe Prophet replied:\n“There was only light, how could I see Him?’\n[1]\nWhat was the light he saw?  The Prophet explained:\n“Surely, Allah does not sleep nor is it befitting\nfor Him to sleep.  He is the one who lowers the scales and raises them.  The\ndeeds of the night go up to Him before the deeds of the day and those of the\nday before those of the night, and His veil is the light.”\n[2]\nVision of God in Spiritual Experiences\nSome people, including some who claim to be Muslims,\nreport spiritual experiences where they have claimed to have seen God.  Common\nreported experiences also include seeing lights, or a magnificent being seated\non a throne.  Such an experience is usually accompanied by dropping basic\nIslamic practices like\nsalah\nand fasting, under the mistaken opinion\nthat such practices are only for common people who had not had their type of\nexperience.\nOne of the fundamental foundations of Islam is that the\nlaw revealed to Prophet Muhammad cannot be changed or canceled.  God neither\nmakes lawful for some what He has made unlawful for others, nor does He communicate\nHis Law thro"

So he came to Allah’s\nMessenger and told him the story, upon which the Messenger asked him to bring\nher.\nWhen\nshe came, the Prophet asked her,\n‘Where is Allah?’\nShe answered, ‘Above\nthe sky.’  The Prophet asked her,\n‘Who am I?’\nShe said, ‘You are the\nMessenger of Allah.’  He said,\n‘Free her, for she is a believer.’\n[1]\nHere, the Prophet affirmed her statement that Al"

He, the Exalted, says:\n“And We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), except as a mercy to\nthe worlds.” (Quran 21:107)\nProphet Muhammad was the embodiment of mercy.   He\nshowed gentleness and compassion to all those he came in contact with; his\nfamily, orphans, friends, slaves, and strangers.\n“And by the Mercy of God, you dealt with them gently.   And\nhad you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about\nyou; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah’s) Forgiveness for them...”\n(Quran 3:159)\n·The Quran\nThe Quran is Allah’s greatest gift to humanity – it is a\nbook like no other.  The Quran guides humankind to high standards of morality\nand exhorts them to strive to be the best human beings possible.   Whenever\nlife becomes too difficult or we are beset by injury, illness or unhappiness, the\nQuran will light our way and lighten our burdens.   It is a source of solace\nand ease.  It is a mercy to humankind.\n“And We have not sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (O\nMuhammad), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which\nthey differ, and (as) a guidance and a\nmercy\nfor a people who believe.”\n(Quran 16:64)\n“And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent\ndown, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e.  do not disobey His Orders), that you\nmay receive mercy.”(Quran 6:155)\n·Leniencies in matters of worship.\nIslam teaches that every\nsingle aspect of life can be an act of worship.  Everything from eating and\ndrinking to sleeping and going to the bathroom can be done in a way that\npleases Allah.\nIslam is a faith that is flexible, lenient and merciful.\nFor instance, if a believer is sick and cannot fast\nduring the month of Ramadan, he is not mandated to fast.  In fact he is\nencouraged to not fast.  Similarly if a Muslim cannot make the\nHajj\ndue\nto physical or financial difficulties he or"

all\nqualities that a Muslim is expected to cultivate in this life.  Because of this\nIslam places great emphasis on developing the qualities of compassion,\nsympathy, forgiveness, and love.   Both the Quran and the\nSunnah\nof\nProphet Muhammad display and encourage these ideals.  Allah blesses Muslims who\nare kind to others and dislikes behaviour that is hard hearted or cruel.  Consequently\nProphet Muhammad could often be heard invoking God’s Mercy on the believers.\nMercy & Forgiveness\nAllah’s mercy should never be underestimated and the qualities\nof mercy and forgiveness are linked together throughout the Quran and the\nauthentic traditions - the\nSunnah\n- of Prophet Muhammad.  Allah asks us\nto seek forgiveness from Him and Prophet Mohammad reminded us that God forgives\nwhen we turn to Him.   In the last part of the night, when darkness lies\nheavily across the land, God descends to the lowest heaven and asks His slaves. \n“Who is saying a prayer to Me that I may answer it?  Who is asking something of\nMe that I may give it to him?  Who is asking forgiveness of Me that I may\nforgive him?”\n[2]\n“Say, ‘O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves\n[by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah.  Indeed, Allah forgives all\nsins.  Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’ And return [in\nrepentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you;\nthen you will not be helped.” (Quran 39: 53 – 54)\nAllah created humankind with an inclination to commit\nsins and make mistakes, however when a person repents he or she is able to see\nand experience Allah’s divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness.  Prophet\nMuhammad said, “If you did not commit sins, Allah would wipe you out of\nexistence and replace with another people who would commit sins and in turn\nseek Allah’s forgiveness.\n[3]\nFalling into error, realizing the mistake, and seeking Allah’s forgiveness\nwhilst hoping for His mercy, is spiritual growth that develops a person’s love\nfor Allah.  Allah loves those who constantly turn to Him seeking forgiveness.\nAlthough Allah is eager for all human beings to turn to Him\nand ask forgiveness, and although His mercy is vast and all-encompassing, this\nis not a license to commit sins.  In order for a person to feel the mercy of\nAllah and be forgiven for his or her transgressions, the conditions of\nrepentance should be fulfilled\n[4]\n. \nThen and only then will the mercy of Allah descend.\nThe mercy of Allah is made manifest when Allah counts\nthe sin of the sinner as one sin.  It is further manifested when Allah rewards\nthe righteous person ten times what his good deed is worth and then Allah may multiply\nhis reward even more than ten times.  “Allah ordered (the appointed angels over\nyou) that the good and the bad deeds be written, and He then showed (the way)\nhow (to write).  If someone intends to do a good deed and he does not do it,\nthen Allah will write for him a full good deed; and if he intends to do a good\ndeed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him (its reward equal) from\nten to seven hundred times to many more times.  And If someone intends to do a\nbad deed and he does not do it, then Allah will write for him a full good deed\n(in his account) with Him, and if he intends to do a bad deed and actually did\nit, then Allah will write for him one bad deed.”\n[5]\nAlso, Allah erases sins with each good deed performed.\n“…Verily, the good\ndeeds r"

If the image was\ndistorted, it was taken as a sign of impending disaster. Thus the ‘unbreakable’\nmetal mirrors of the early Egyptians and Greeks were valued items because of\ntheir magical properties (such as possessing undistorted reflecting properties).\nAfter glass mirrors were introduced, the Romans took the broken mirror as a\nsign of bad luck, since each piece reflected and multiplied their ‘other self’.\nThe length of the prescribed misfortune came from the Roman belief that man's\nbody was physically rejuvenated every 7 years, and he became, in effect, a new\nman.\n(2) Knocking on wood: the ancient belief that\nspirits either dwelled in, or guarded trees.  Greeks worshipped the oak as it\nwas sacred to Zeus, Celts believed in tree spirits, and both believed touching\nsacred trees would bring good fortune.  Irish lore holds that ‘touching wood’ is\na way to thank the leprechauns for a bit of luck.  Pagans also held similar\nbeliefs of protective tree spirits.  Chinese and Koreans thought the spirits of\nmothers who died in childbirth remained in nearby trees.  Another explanation\npoints to the wooden Christian cross as the origin of  ‘good luck,’ although\nthis is likely a Christian adaptation of earlier pagan practices.\n(3)  The inadvertent spilling of salt is believed\nto be followed by misfortune, so it is deliberately spilled, or cast, over the\nleft shoulder to counter it.  Superstitions about salt date back to biblical\ntimes when salt was a highly prized commodity.  It was expensive, crucial in\npreserving food, and was often used in place of currency.  So spilling salt was\nconsidered an almost sacrilegious offence, and left one exposed to the devil's\nmachinations.  Throwing salt over your shoulder is thought to be a way of\nkeeping the devil at bay while you are in especially vulnerable.  The salt is\neither intended to blind the devil so he can not witness your error, or keep\nhim from sneaking up on you while you are cleaning up the mess.\n(4)  Friday 13\nth\n: Western culture has\nconsidered Friday 13th particularly unlucky for hundreds of years.  The 13\nth\nfloor in many high-rise buildings in America is called the 14\nth\nfloor.  The sixth day of the week has often been considered unlucky, as has the\nnumber 13.  The combination, which occurs one to three times a year, leads inevitably\nto this reinforced superstition.\nPeople\navoid traveling on this day. Some say the number 13 was purposely vilified by\nthe priests of patriarchal religions because it represented femininity.  Thirteen\ncorresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year, and the\nnumber was revered in prehistoric goddess-worshipping cultures.  Hindus\nbelieved that it was unlucky for 13 people to gather in one place.  This\nconviction was shared by the ancient Scandinavians.  Many biblical events of\nnegative import supposedly occurred on a Friday, including the ejection of Adam\nand Eve from the Garden of Eden, the start of the Great Flood, and the purported\ncrucifixion of Jesus.\nIslamic Ruling on Omens\nBefore Islam the Arabs used to consider the direction in\nwhich birds flew to be a sign of good or bad omen.  If a person set out on a\njourney and saw a bird fly over"

the\nKingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs exclusively to Him, and He owns them. \nHe alone brought existence out of non-existence and it depends on Him for its\nconservation and continuance.  His power is required at every moment to sustain\nall creatures.  Angels, prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant\nkingdoms are under His control.  Only Allah knows what the future holds.  Good\nluck and bad fortune are from Allah alone.\nFaith in charms, amulets, and talismans contradict\nbelief in Allah’s Lordship by attributing the ability to bring good luck or\navert bad fortune to these created brings whereas only Allah can bring good and\navert harm.  Consequently, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, opposed these superstitious practices and taught people to have firm\nbelief in their Lord, rather than amulets, which cannot change what Allah has\ndestined and can bring no good fortune to anyone.  Even though they are not\ncapable of averting any harm, belief in amulets usually leads to idolatry over\ntime.  This can be s"

It serves as a focal\npoint towards which all Muslims face when praying.\n·\nSalah -\nthe Arabic word to\ndenote a direct connection between the believer and Allah.

Umar, one of the closest of companions\nto the Prophet, related the following occurrence:\n“Once, while we were\nsitting with the Prophet, a man appeared before us whose clothes were\nexceedingly white and hair exceedingly black.  No signs of traveling were seen\non him and no one among us knew him.  He sat towards the Prophet, resting his\nknees against his knees and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs. He then\nsaid: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’\nThe Messenger replied: ‘Islam\nis to testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad\nis the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the compulsory\ncharity (\nzakah\n), to fast in\nRamadan\n, and to make the pilgrimage\nto the House if you are able to do so.’\nHe said: ‘You have spoken the\ntruth.’\nWe were amazed at him\nasking questions and then saying he had spoken the truth!\nHe then inquired: ‘Tell me\nabout faith (\nImaan\n)?’\nThe Prophet replied: ‘It\nis to believe in Allah, His angels, His scriptures, His messengers, and the\nLast Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its sweetness and its bitterness.’\nHe said: ‘You have spoken the\ntruth.’\nUmar then related some more\nquestions he asked and the answers given by the Prophet.  Finally, when the man\nleft, the Prophet asked:\n‘O ‘Umar, do you know who\nwas the questioner?’\nI said: ‘Allah and His\nMessenger know best.’\nThe Prophet said: ‘It was\nGabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.’”\n[1]\nThe Meaning of ‘Islam’\nThe Arabic word\n‘Islam\n’\nmeans to submit, a total surrender, a total resignation to God.  Therefore, a\n‘Muslim’ is ‘one who submits to God.’ Islam means to submit to Allah alone, to\nworship and serve Allah alone, and to believe and follow the prophet sent to\nthem.  To many non-Muslims, ‘Islam’ is a religion that began in the seventh\ncentury in the Middle East, but to Muslims, Islam has always been the only\nreligion of Allah since the time of Adam, the first man.  Thus, Islam was the\nreligion of all prophets who came after him.  In the time of Moses, Islam was\nto worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings Moses had brought,\nand Islam in the time of Jesus was to worship Allah alone and believe and\nfollow the teachings Jesus had brought, as they were both prophets sent by God\nto teach his religion.  After the coming of Prophet Muhammad, Islam is to\nworship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.\nAlthough the teachings of all the prophets about God, the Afterlife, and all\nother realities of belief were the same, there were slight differences in the\nmethods of practice, worship and service, for each prophet was sent to a\nspecific nation and specific period of time. Even though previous religions\ncome under the general heading of Islam, the religion of Muhammad has specifically\nbeen given the name ‘Islam’ by God, as it is the final religion prescribed for\nhumanity until the Day of Judgment.\nThe Five Pillars of Islam\nAllah has mandated five acts upon\nwhich the whole religion of Islam is built. Due to their importance, the\nProphet stated in another\nhadith\n:\n“Islam has been built upon\nfive…”\n…and\nthen proceeded to mention the same acts of worship described in the\nhadith\nof Gabriel above.\nThese acts\nof worship are called the Pillars of Islam, and they are as follows:\n1. Testimony of faith (\nShahadah\n)\nOne\nmust profess this testimony of faith, summarized in the two testimonies:\n(a) There\nis no deity rightfully worshipped but Allah\n(b)\nMuhammad is His Messenger.\nThrough\nthe belief and attestation of the Testimony of Faith (\nShahadah\n) one\nenter"

Islamic doctrine revolves around six aspects described by the\nProphet.\n1. Belief in Allah\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief in Allah’s\nexistence.\n(ii)  Allah is the Lord.\nHe is the Creator, the Provider, the Sustainer, and the Owner of the entire\nuniverse. None has any share in these roles.\n(iii) Allah is the only\nbeing entitled to worship. No worship, service or veneration is to be offered\nto others besides Allah or along with Him, whether they be prophets, priests,\nsaints, angels, idols, or stones.\n(iv) Allah has the most\nbeautiful and perfect of names and attributes, which none can be compared to. He\nis Unique, separate and unlike His creation. No evil or deficiency can be\nattributed to Him.\n2. Belief in the Angels\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief in the existence\nof angels, a creation of Allah.\n(ii)  Belief that they\nhave no right to receive any form of worship\n(iii) Belief in the names by\nwhich the angels are identified in the Quran and\nSunnah\n(teachings of\nProphet Muhammad).\n(iv) Belief in the special\ntasks assigned to each of them by Allah in the Quran and\nSunnah\n(teachings of Prophet Muhammad).\n3. Belief in the Revealed Scriptures\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief that Allah\nrevealed scriptures to various prophets.\n(ii)  Belief that they\ncontained the truth from Allah.\n(iii) Belief that all\nprevious scriptures other than the Quran have been altered.\n(iv) Belief in the Quran has\nseveral aspects:\na)\nBelief that it is one of the scriptures of Allah.\nb)\nBelief that it is the Final Revelation to humanity, and that no other scripture\nwill be revealed after it.\nc)\nBelief that everything in it is true, containing no falseness.\nd)\nBelief that it has remained unchanged, and will remain so for eternity.\ne)\nBelief that it has abrogated all previous scriptures before it.\n4. Belief in the Messengers\n, which entails the following:\n(i)    Belief that Allah sent prophets to every nation, calling them\nto worship and obey Allah Alone. One must believe in all of them, known or\nunknown, without rejecting any of them.\n(ii)   Belief that they were the best of humanity, chosen due to\ntheir virtuousness.\n(iii)  Belief that they were mere humans, not divine in any way, and\nthat they do not have any right to receive worship, nor did they claim so.\n(iv)  Belief that they merely conveyed the message from Allah and\ndid not legislate from their own selves.\n(v)   Belief that they did not err in conveying the message.\n(vi)  Belief that obedience to them is a must.\n(vi)  Belief that Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, was a prophet, which entails those issues discussed in the lesson\nentitled\nThe Testimony of Faith\n.\n5. Belief in Life after Death and\nthe Final Day of Judgment, which\nentails the following:\n(i)   Belief that a day\nwill come when everything will come to an end, and Allah will raise the\ncreation and judge them according to their deeds.\n(ii) Belief that those who\nbelieved and practically followed the correct religion by following the\nprophets will enter Paradise for eternity, and that those who disbelieved will\nenter the Hellfire for eternity.\n6.       Belief in Divine Decree\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief that Allah’s\nForeknowledge is all inclusive and complete. He has always known everything\nthat would or would not happen, even before the creation of mankind.\n(ii)  Belief that Allah\nhas recorded everything that was going to occur until the Day of Judgment in a book\nknown as “The Mother of the Books” or “The Preserved Tablet”.\n(iii) Belief that whatever\nAllah willed has occurred, is occurring, and will occur. Nothing occurs against\nor without this Will.\n(iv) Allah created\neverything.\nWe have mentioned here the\nminimal requirements of faith in each of these six categories that Muslims\nbelieve in, as the Prophet mentioned that these articles form the basis of Islamic\nbelief and faith.\nIn subsequent lessons, we will\nexplore the essential teachings by studying each of the Five Pillars of Islam\nand the Six Articles of Faith in detail."

 Or who owns hearing and sight?  And who brings out the living\nfrom the dead and brings out the dead from the living?  And who disposes the\naffairs?’  They will say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s\npunishment (for setting up rivals with Allah)?’” (Quran 10:31)\nHe is the ever-ruling King and the Savior, the\nLiving God, full of wisdom.  No one can change His decisions.  Angels,\nprophets, human beings, and the animal and plant kingdoms are under His control. \nHistorically, few people have denied the existence of the Lord; throughout ages\npeople for most part have believed in One God, a Supreme Being, a supernatural\nCreator.\n(ii)  Allah is the only Ruler of the\naffairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver\n[1]\n,\nthe Absolute Judge, the Legislator, He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just\nlike the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the\nmoral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from\nwrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,\ndetermine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human\ninteraction and behavior.  His is the command:\n“His is the Creation and Command.” (Quran 7:54)\n(c) Allah is Entitled to Worship\nAllah has the exclusive right to be worshipped\ninwardly and outwardly, by one’s actions and by one’s heart.  Not only can no\none be worshipped\napart\nfrom Him, absolutely no one else can be\nworshipped\nalong\nwith\nHim.  He has no partners or associates in\nworship.  Worship, in its comprehensive sense and in all its aspects, is for\nHim alone.\n“There is no true god worthy of worship but He, the\nMost Merciful, the Most Compassionate.” (Quran 2:163)\nAllah’s right to be worshipped can not be over\nemphasized.  It is the essential meaning of\nLaa ilaaha ill-Allaah\n.  A\nnon-Muslim enters Islam by testifying to Allah’s sole right to be worshipped.  It\nis the crux of Islamic belief in Allah, even all of Islam.  It was the central\nmessage of all prophets and messengers sent by Allah.  They all declared\nclearly:\n“Worship Allah!  You have no other god but Him.” (Quran 7:59, 11: 50, 23:32)\nIt was the central message of Abraham, Isaac,\nIshmael, Moses, the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, and Muhamma"

Thus the word\nriyaa\nmeans showing\noff, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically\nriyaa\nmeans to perform\nacts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than\nAllah.\nThe Arabic word\nshirk\nis the opposite of\ntawheed\n,\nAllah’s oneness, and is more inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.  It means\nassociating Allah with other deities.\nShirk\nis to associate others with\nAllah in certain aspects designated as unique to Him and exclusively His in the\nQuran and\nSunnah\n.\nThere is no issue upon which Islam is so strict\nas the one of monotheism (\ntawheed\n). Associating partners with God (\nshirk\n)\nis the deadliest sin, the greatest violation with which the Lord of the heavens\nand the earth may be defied.  Death in the state of\nshirk\npermanently severs\na person from divine grace:\n“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner be set with\nHim (i.e.  the sin of\nshirk\n), and forgives all besides that to whom he\npleases.” (Quran 4:48)\nShirk\nhas many forms, some of which will\nbe discussed below.\nThe Greater\nShirk\nActs which fall under this category of\nshirk\nare regarded as unforgivable. Allah will not forgive them unless one repents.\n“Verily, Allah does not forgive\nshirk\n, but He\nforgives other than that to whom He pleases”\nThis category contradicts the very purpose of\ncreation, as expressed in Allah’s statement:\n“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship\nMe Alone.” (Quran 51:56)\nIn this category of\nshirk\n, acts of\nworship are directed to beings\nother than\nAllah or\nalongside\nHim,\nas is their rewards.  Allah gives an example of this type in the Quran, in His saying:\n“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah,\nbeing sincerely obedient to Him, but when he brings them safe to the land, lo,\nthey commit\nshirk\nwith Him.” (Quran 29:65)\nThe Quran stresses in many verses that Allah\ndoes not share His powers with any partner.  It warns those who believe their\nidols will intercede for them that they, together with the idols, will become\nfuel for Hellfire on the Day of Judgment.\nThe greater\nshirk\nincludes invoking or\nsupplicating to a false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides\nAllah.  Christians pray to a man who they believe to share divinity with Allah,\nthe Prophet of Allah Jesus, peace be upon him.  Catholics direct certain types\nof worship to saints, angels, and Mary, which they regard as “veneration”. All\nthese things are regarded as\nshirk\n.\nIt is also considered\nshirk\nto pray to\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, or to\ngraves of holy men.\nBelieving in the legislation of others, whether\ngovernments or religious leaders in opposition to the clear teachings of Islam is\nalso a major form of\nshirk\n, as Allah says:\n“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their\nrabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)\nThey took them as lords besides Allah not by directly\npraying to them, but by willfully accepting their changing the lawful into\nprohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave them\nthe authority that only Allah has - to legislate in divine law.\nAnother form of major\nshirk\nis giving any\ncreation a portion of divine love reserved for Allah.\n“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others\nbesides Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But\nthose who believe love Allah (more than anything else)...” (Quran 2:165)\nLesser Forms of\nShirk\nSwearing by other than Allah and carrying out\nreligious acts for worldly gain, like showing off or to win favors are two of\nthe lesser forms of\nshirk\n.  Allah’s Messenger said:\n“The thing I fear for you the most is ‘lesser\nshirk\n.’ The companions asked ‘Oh!  Messenger of Allah, what is “lesser\nshirk\n?”\n He replied showing off, for surely Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection\nwhen people are receiving their rewards, ‘Go to those for whom you were showing\noff in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.’” (\nAhmad\n,\nat-Tabarani\n,\nal-Baihaqi\n)"

It is the system of\ncommunication between the Creator and the created.  Allah does not send the angels\nto every single individual, nor does He ‘open the skies’ so people can climb up\nto receive the message.  His way of communication is through human messengers who\nreceive the message through the angels. Allah only sent men as prophets and messengers.\nNo angels were sent with a message to mankind. He, the Exalted, says:\n‘And they say, “Why was there not sent down to him an angel?\nBut if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they\nwould not be reprieved. And if We had made him [i.e. the Messenger] an angel,\nWe would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with\nthat in which they cover themselves.’ (6:8-9)\nWhat Does the Belief in the Messengers Entail?\nFaith in messengers is to firmly believe Allah chose\nmorally upright men to bear His message and pass it on to humanity.  Blessed\nwere those who followed them, wretched were those who refused to obey.  They\nfaithfully delivered the message, without hiding, altering, or corrupting it.  Rejecting\na messenger is rejecting the One who sent him.  Disobeying a messenger is\ndisobeying the One who commanded to obey him.\nDisbelieving in one messenger is like disbelieving in\nall the messengers. In the following verse, Allah, the Exalted, says that the\npeople of Noah disbelieved in all the messengers, even though they were\ncommanded only to follow Noah:\n‘The people of Noah disbelieved in the messengers.’\n(Quran 26:105)\nMore specifically, belief in messengers means:\n(1)  Allah sent to every nation a prophet from\namongst them, to call them to worship Allah alone and to shun false gods.\n“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our messengers whom We sent\nbefore you: ‘Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most\nMerciful (that is Allah)?’” (Quran 43:45)\nThey did not add or omit anything from the Divine\nMessage.\n“Are the messengers charged with anything but to convey\nclearly the Message?” (Quran 16:35)\n(2)  Belief in those have been specifically\nmentioned, such as Muhammad, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Noah, peace be upon them\nall.  We hold a general belief in those not mentioned by name as Allah says:\n“And indeed, We have sent messengers before you (O Muhammad); of\nsome of them We have related to you their story.  And of some We have not\nrelated to you their story” (Quran 40:78)\nWe believe the final messenger was our Prophet Muhammad\nand there is no prophet or messenger after him as Allah has said in the Quran:\n“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the\nMessenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.  And Allah is Ever All‑Aware\nof everything.” (Quran 33:40)\nThe Prophet stated categorically:\n“There will be no prophet after me.” (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nPrevious prophets were sent with laws and commandments\nspecific to that people in that time. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings\nof Allah be upon him, however was sent with a message applicable for all time,\npeople and places; thus, there is no need for more prophets to come. Another\nimportant reason is that some nations were sent more than one prophet due to the\nchanges they introduced into the religion. Since God has promised that the\nteachings of Prophet Muhammad will never undergo change and will always be preserved\nin the original language in their primary sources – the Quran and Sunnah, there\nis no need for another prophet.  In the cases of earlier prophets, scriptures were\nlost or their message became corrupted to the point that truth was hardly\ndistinguishable from falsehood.  The message of Prophet Muhammad is clear and\npreserved till the end of times.\n(3)  Belief in the sound reports that have"

Allah, the Exalted, says:\n‘Indeed, it is We who sent down the message and\nindeed, We will be its guardian.’ (15:9)\n(4)In\norder that Allah’s conclusive argument brought by the messengers against human\nbeings remains after their death.\n“Messengers\nas bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that humankind should\nhave no plea against Allah after the messengers. And Allah is Ever All\nPowerful, All Wise.” (Quran 4:165)\nNo one\ncan plea that the prophets and their messages are no longer in existence as\nlong as the scriptures are present.\nBelief in scriptures entails:\n(i)   Allah truly revealed them.\n(ii)  Belief in the names of certain scriptures.\n(iii) Belief that they contain the truth. As for\nthe scriptures prior to the Quran, since they have been changed, we believe in\nthe\noriginal\nscriptures that were revealed to the prophets.\n(iv) Belief that the Quran is a witness over them\nand confirms them. The truth remains one and the same, and thus the Quran\nconfirms the truth which was in them. As for the laws, the Quran has abrogated\nthe previous scriptures.\nFirst, a Muslim firmly believes that Divine Scriptures\nwere revealed by Allah to His messengers to guide mankind.  Muslims believe the\nQuran is not the only spoken Word of Allah, but that Allah also spoke to\nprophets before Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon\nhim.\n“…and to Moses Allah spoke directly.” (Quran 4:164)\nAllah describes true believers are those who:\n“…believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad) and\nwhat has been sent down before you.” (Quran 2:4)\nThe most important and central message of\nall\nscriptures was to worship Allah alone.\n“And we sent never a messenger before you except that we\nrevealed to him, saying, ‘there is no God but I so worship Me.” (Quran 21:25)\nSecond, we believe in the scriptures mentioned in the Quran:\n(i)   the Quran itself, revealed to Prophet\nMuhammad.\n(ii)  the Torah (\nTaurah\nin Arabic) revealed\nto Prophet Moses (different from the Old Testament read today).\n(iii) the Gospel (\nInjeel\nin Arabic) revealed\nto Prophet Jesus (different from the New Testament read in churches today).\n(iv) the Psalms (\nZabur\nin Arabic) of David.\n(v)  The scriptures (\nSuhuf\nin Arabic) of\nMoses and Abraham.\nWe have a general belief that there were other\nscriptures revealed by Allah whose names and specifics are not known to us.\nThus we cannot definitely affirm that scriptures of other religions prior to\nMuhammad other than those mentioned were revealed from Allah.\nThird, Muslims believe whatever is true in them and has\nnot been altered or corrupted in the previous scriptures.  This point will be\nelaborated below so it becomes clear and no confusion remains.\nFourth, belief that Allah revealed the Quran as a\nwitness over the previous scriptures and to confirm them, as Allah says:\n“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran)\nin truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and trustworthy in\nhighness and a witness over it (old Scriptures)” (Quran 5:48)\nMeaning the Quran confirms whatever is true in previous\nscriptures and rejects whatever alterations and changes human hands have made\nin them, and that the laws brought by the Quran overrule and abrogate any laws brought\nby the previous religions.\nOriginal Scriptures & the Bible\nWe must distinguish between two matters: the\noriginal\nTorah, Gospel, and Pslams and the\npresent day\nBible.  We believe the\noriginals\nwere Allah’s revelation, but the\npresent day\nBible does\nnot\nhave\nthe exact original scripture.\nNo scripture exists today in the original language it\nwas revealed in, except the Quran.  The Bible was not revealed in English.  Different\nbooks of today’s Bible are translations of translations and different versions\nexist.  These multiple translations were done by people whose knowledge or\nhonesty is not known.  As a result, some Bibles are bigger than others and"

 Only Allah knows.\nAl-Bayt\nal-Ma’moor\nis a sacred house in the heavens above the\nKabah\n, the\nblack cubical sacred house in Mecca.  Every day seventy thousand angels visit\nit and leave, never returning to it again, another group coming after them.\n[1]\nThe Messenger of Allah said:\n“Hell will be brought forth that day by means of\nseventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand\nangels.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nThe Names of Angels\nWe are required to believe in the names of the angels\nthat have been mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah.  They include:\nGabriel (\nJibreel\nin Arabic), Michael (\nMikaa’eel\n),\nIsrafeel\n,\nMalik\n- the gatekeeper of Hell,\nMunkar\nand\nNakeer\n,\nand\nHaarut\nand\nMaarut\nand others.\nThe names Raphael and Azra’eel are not furnished in\nIslamic texts.  Of the above, only Gabriel and Michael are mentioned in the\nBible.\nAngelic Abilities\nThe angels have great powers given to them by Allah.\nThey have the ability to take on different forms other\nthan their own.  At the moment of Jesus’ conception, Allah sent Gabriel to Mary\nin the form of a man, as Allah says in the Quran:\n“…Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as\na man in all respects.” (Quran 19:17)\nAngels also came to Abraham in human form, and he did\nnot know that they were angels until they told him so.  Similarly, angels came\nto Lot to deliver him from danger in the form of young men with beautiful faces. \nGabriel used to come to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, in different forms.  Sometimes he would appear in the form of one\nof his handsome disciples, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin.\nAngels have the ability to take human forms in some\ncircumstances involving common people, such as the ones who came to the man who\nkilled a hundred people and those who came to the blind, the bald and the leper.\nThe greatest speed known to man today is the speed of\nlight; the angels are able to travel much faster than thi"

    "fullText": "Prerequisites\n·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and\nArticles of Faith (2 parts).\nObjectives\n·To learn what the belief in life after death\nentails.\n·To learn some of the major events that will\ntake place on the Day of Judgement.\n·To learn about the types of intercession\nthat will be granted on that Day.\n·To understand the nature of Paradise and\nHell.\nArabic Terms\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is\ngenerally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or\napproved.\nSimply stated, there will be a Day when\nGod will resurrect and gather the first and the last of His creation and judge\neveryone justly. People will enter their final abode, Hell or Paradise.\n(A) Belief in Events of the Grave\nMuslims believe that after a person\ndies, the second, intermediate phase of life begins. Many events will take\nplace in this new “world.”\nOne of the first events is the “trial”\nof the grave - everyone will be questioned by angels about their religion,\nprophet, and Lord.\nSecond, a Muslim should also believe in\nthe punishment and the bliss of the grave. Basically a Muslim must believe in\nthe details of the events that will take place in the grave as they have come\nin the Qur’an and\nSunnah\n.\n(B) Events of the Day of Judgment\nAfter the duration of this earth is\nover, Allah will command a great angel named\nIsrafeel\nto blow the\nTrumpet. At the first blowing, all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth\nwill fall unconscious, except those spared by God. The earth will be flattened\nand the mountains turned into dust.\nThe skies will rain for forty days,\npeople will be resurrected into their original bodies from their graves,\nthereby entering the third and final phase of life.\nIsrafeel\nwill blow the Trumpet for the second time upon which people will rise up from\ntheir graves, alive. The disbelievers and the hypocrites will be caught by\nsurprise and regret, whereas the believers will find it exactly as they were\ntold.\nThe angels will drive all human beings\nnaked, uncircumcised, and bare-footed to the Great Plain of Gathering called\nHashr\n.\nThe first one to be dressed on that Day will be Abraham. At the Great Plain of\nGathering, a re-created sun will shine close to their heads, and they will\nsweat according to their deeds. Some people will be sheltered under the shade\nof God’s Magnificent Throne.\nWhen the conditions will become\nunbearable, people will request God to allow the Prophets and the Messengers to\nintercede on their behalf to save them from distress. All prophets will excuse themselves,\nuntil Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, will\nbe allowed to intercede and thus Judgment will begin.\nThe Balances\nThe balances will be set and the deeds\nof men will be weighed. These balances will be real. God will give the deeds of\nHis creatures a material existence with weight. Good deeds will be placed in\none pan and the evil deeds will be placed in the other, as Allah has informed\nin the Qur’an.\nThe Records\nDisclosure of the Records of the deeds\nperformed in this life will follow. The person who will receive his record in\nhis right hand will have an easy reckoning. He will happily go back to his\nfamily. However, the person who will receive his record in his left hand would\nwish he were dead as he will be thrown into the Fire. He will be full of\nregrets as will wish that he were not handed his Record or that he had not\nknown it.\nThen Allah will judge His creation.\nThey will be reminded and informed of their good and evil deeds. The faithful\nwill acknowledge their sins and be forgiven. The disbelievers will have no good\ndeeds to declare because an unbeliever is rewarded for his good deeds in this\nlife. Some scholars are of the opinion that the punishment of an unbeliever may\nbe reduced in lieu of his good deeds, except the punishment of the great sin of\ndisbelief.\nThe Prophet’s Pond\nEvery prophet will have a pond, but the\nPond of our Prophet will be the largest, sweetest, and with the largest number\nof visitors. Its water will be sweeter than honey and whiter than milk; its\nutensils will be as numerous as the stars; and anyone who quenches his thirst\nonce from it will never thirst again.\nThe\nSiraat\nThe\nSiraat\nis a real bridge that\nwill be established over Hell extending between Paradise and the Fire. Anyone\nwho is steadfast on God’s religion in this life will find it easy to pass it.\nIt will be thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword! People will pass over\nit as fast as the blinking of an eye, lightening, wind, fast moving horses,\nrunning camels, or at a normal walking pace. Some will barely crawl over it.\nThey will be grabbed by iron hooks and thrust into the Fire. The one who\ncrosses the\nSiraat\nwill get into Paradise.\nThose who cross itwill be\nassembled at a place between Paradise and Hell. They will get their mutual\ndebts settled and then allowed to enter Paradise.\n(C) Intercession Granted to the Prophets\n& the Ri"

    "fullText": "Prerequisites\n·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and\nArticles of Faith (2 parts).\nObjectives\n·To realize the importance and emphasis laid\ndown by Islam with regards to belief in divine decree (\nQadr\n).\n·To learn the first two components that the\nbelief in divine decree entails, i-e Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive and\ncomplete and that Allah has recorded everything in the Preserved Tablet.\nArabic Terms\n·\nQadr\n– divine decree.\n·\nAl-Lawh Al-Mahfuz\n- the Preserved\nTablet.\nThe sixth and last article of Islamic faith is\nbelief in divine decree (\nQadr\nin Arabic).  The divine decree (\nQadr\n)\nis an extremely important article of faith, and people of various faiths have\ndiffered among themselves concerning this issue for a long time.\nThe divine decree is Allah’s ‘hidden mystery’\nwhose depths are inaccessible for human beings to fathom.  A Muslim should\nlearn the correct belief regarding the divine decree and stick to the advice of\nthe Prophet:\n“When the divine decree (\nQadr\n) is\nmentioned, take to silence.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nAt the same time, we have been given enough\ninformation about this subject in order for us to be at peace with it, even if\nwe may not know its intricacies. For this reason, it is a compulsory aspect of\nfaith, and emphasizing the importance of this belief, Ibn Umar, the famous\nCompanion of Prophet Muhammad, once swore and said of those who rejected it, ‘If\none of them were to spend gold equal to Mount Uhad in the way of Allah, it will\nnever be accepted by Allah from them, unless they believe in the divine decree\n.\n’\nUbada bin Samit, a Companion of the Prophet, was\non his death bed when his son visited him and asked,\n‘O Father, give me advice so I may hold to it.’\nUbada said,\n‘Sit down.  O my son, you shall never taste\nfaith, and shall not reach the reality of the knowledge of Allah until you have\nfaith in the divine decree, the good of it and the evil of it.’\nSo I said,\n‘O my father, how do I know what is the good of the\ndivine decree and the evil of it?’\nHe said,\n‘Know that what afflicted you, could never have missed\nyou; and what missed you, could never have afflicted you.  O my son, I heard\nthe Prophet of Allah say that the first thing Allah created was the Pen.  He\nsaid to it, ‘Write’.  So it wrote everything that would take place till the Day\nof Judgment.  O my son, if you die while not believing in this, then you will\nenter the Fire.’\nAd-Daylami says:\n“I went to Ubayy bin Ka’b and told him that I had\nsome doubts regarding the divine decree, so tell me something so that perchance\nAllah makes it leave my heart.  He said, ‘If Allah were to punish the\ninhabitants of the heavens and the earth, He would punish them and He would not\nbe unjust to them; and if He were to show Mercy to them, it would be better for\nthem than their deeds.  And if you were to spend gold the like of Mount Uhad,\nit will not be accepted by Allah until you had faith in the divine decree.  And\nknow that what afflicted you could never have missed you, and what missed you\ncould never have afflicted you.’”\nSo he went to Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud who told him\nthe same thing.  So he went to Hudthaifah bin al-Yaman\n[1]\nwho told him the same thing.  He went to Zayd bin Thabit who also told him the\nsame thing.\n[2]\nWhat is this faith in the divine decree (\nQadr\n)\nthat these great Companions considered as salvation from the Fire?  What\nexactly does one have to believe in?\n(1)  Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive\nand complete.\n(2)  Allah has recorded everything in the\nPreserved Tablet.\n(3)  Allah’s Will always comes to pass, and\nHis Ability is perfect.\n(4)  Allah created everything.\n(1)    Allah’s Foreknowledge is All Inclusive and\nComplete\nThe first necessary component is to believe in Allah’s\ninfallible foreknowledge.  Allah knows what the creatures will do, encompassing\neverything by His knowledge.  He knows all that exists, in entirety and\ntotality, by virtue of His ancient and eternal foreknowledge.  It is the same\nto Him whether it is related to His Actions or the acts of His slaves.  He\nknows their state, obedience and disobedience, sustenance, life span, successes\nand failures, and all their movements.  Before He created them, and even before\nHe created the heavens and the earth, Allah knew exactly who will enter Paradise and who will abide in Hell.\n“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or\nin the heavens.” (Quran 3:5)\n“Do you not know that Allah knows all that occurs in\nheaven and on earth?” (Quran 22:70)\nWhoever refuses it denies Allah’s perfection,\nbecause the opposite of knowledge is either ignorance or forgetfulness.  It\nwould mean Allah would have been mistaken in His foreknowledge of future\nevents; He would no longer be Omniscient.  Both are deficiencies which Allah is\nfree of.  When Pharaoh asked Moses:\n“(Pharaoh said:) ‘What about the generations of old?’\n(Moses) said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord,\nin a Record.  My Lord is neither unaware nor He forgets’” (Quran 20:51, 52)\nAllah is not unawar"

    "fullText": "Lesson Objectives:\n·To recognise Satan and understand his\nmission.\nArabic terms:\n·\nShaytan\n- sometimes spelled\nShaitan\nor\nShaytaan\n.  It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to\ndenote the devil or Satan, the personification of evil.\n·\nJinn\n- A creation of Allah that was\ncreated before humankind from smokeless flame. They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\n·\nShirk\n- a word that implies ascribing\npartners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or\nbelieving that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another\nbesides Allah.\n·\nKhushoo\n- the act of being completely\nsolemn, submissive and humble towards Allah during the prayer.\nUnlike\nthe descriptions of the devil in Christian doctrine,\nShaytan\nis not a\nfallen angel; rather he is a\nJinn\nwho can think, reason and has free\nwill. Allah allowed him to reside amongst the Angels, but because of his pride\nand arrogance that you can read about in the story of Prophet Adam on the\nwebsite\nwww.islamreligion.com\n, he despairs\nof ever knowing Allah’s mercy and has vowed not to inhabit the depths of Hell\nalone. Satan’s wish is to take as many human beings with him to the Hellfire as\nhe can. Make no mistake about it; Satan is humankind’s mortal enemy. He is\ncunning, crafty and supremely arrogant. Quran warns us of his enmity over and\nover.\n“O children of Adam.  Let not\nShaytan\ndeceive you...”\n(Quran 7:27)\n“Surely\nShaytan\nis an enemy to you so take him as an\nenemy...” (Quran 35:6)\n“...And whoever takes\nShaytan\nas a protector or helper\ninstead of Allah, has surely suffered a manifest loss.” (Quran 4:119)\nIt is important to understand that even Satan himself\nrecognises the Oneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped. Allah has\ninformed us that the promises of Satan are nothing but deceptions and lies, and\nSatan concurs, for he can offer nothing.\n“And\nShaytan\nwill say when the matter has\nbeen decided: Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too\npromised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I\ncalled you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves...”\n(Quran 14:22)\nEvery\nact of disobedience that is hated by Allah is loved by\nShaytan\n, he loves\nimmorality and sin.  He whispers into the ears of the believers, he\ndisrupts prayer and the remembrance of Allah. One of Islam’s greatest scholars,\nIbn ul Qayyim, may God have mercy on him, said: “One of his (Satan’s) plots is\nthat he always bewitches people’s minds until they are deceived, he makes\nattractive to the mind that which will harm it”.\nSatan\nhas\nwide-ranging\nexperience in the field of deception; he has tricks and temptations and he\nwhispers relentlessly. Satan is able to pinch and poke, implanting thoughts and\ndesires. However Allah has not left humankind defenseless. He has provided us\nwith weapons and one of the greatest is information.\nSatan is our\nmortal enemy and in order to combat his tricks and illusions we need to know\nhim well. The long term goal of Satan is to deprive as many people as possible\nof Paradise and to lead them to Hell.  To achieve this aim he has set many\nshort term goals. Being aware of these goals means we are able to arm ourselves\nwith weapons of defence.\nShort Term Goals\n1.To cause people to commit the great sin of\nshirk\n. Everyone\nwho worships something other than Allah, be it an idol, a statue, the sun, the\nmoon, a person or a principle, is in essence worshipping Satan.\n[1]\n2.To encourage people to commit sins and acts of disobedience. When\nSatan despairs of ever being worshipped he is content with being obeyed in\nmatters that seem insignificant.\n[2]\nHe loves immorality and sin because it has a direct effect on a person’s religious\ncommitment.\n3.To prevent people from doing good deeds. Satan not only causes\npeople to commit sin and acts of disobedience, he is also content with\npreventing them from doing acts of good.  Satan is patient; he lays in wait,\nfilling our minds with doubts, and superstitions. When a person is planning on\ndoing a good deed or action, he whispers to them to avoid it and plants small\nnagging doubts in their mind.\n4.To damage acts of worship. If Satan is not able to prevent\npeople from obeying Allah and performing righteous actions, he strives to\ncorrupt their acts of worship. When a person is praying he whispers and\ndistracts him. Satan’s desire is to prevent a person from taking their reward\nfor praying with\nkhushoo\nand eventually to lead him or her away from\nAllah altogether.\n5.\nTo cause mental and physical harm.In addition to causing\nbelievers to commit acts of\nshirk\n, Satan also aims to cause physical and\nmental harm. For instance he sends bad dreams to cause a person distress and\nfear. He disturbs people from the time they are born right up until the moment\nof death. In their final moments, he continues his whispering and harassment to\nprevent a person from calling on Allah and confirming their belief in God"

They often claim the knowledge of the future\nand use various methods and mediums from which they claim to extract their\ninformation, like reading tea-leaves, drawing lines, writing numbers,\npalm-reading, casting horoscopes, crystal ball gazing, rattling bones, and\nthrowing sticks.\nDo they truly know what they claim?\n1.    Some of them have no real knowledge.  They go\nthrough a series of meaningless rituals and then make calculated general\nguesses.  Some of their guesses may coincide with the truth.  People tend to remember\nthe few predictions that come true and forget about the many which do not.\n2.    Another group has contact with the\nJinn\n. \nIt usually involves the grave sin of\nshirk\n, and those involved tend to\nbe more accurate in their information.\nRole of\nJinn\nThe evil\nJinn\ncan often be summoned by performing\nsacrilegious acts forbidden in the religion to aid their human partners in sin\nand disbelief.  Once contact with the\nJinn\nis made by fortune-tellers,\nthe\nJinn\nmay inform them of certain events in the future.  The Prophet,\nmay the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, described how the\nJinn\ngather information about the future.   He related that the\nJinn\nwere\nable to travel to the lower reaches of the heavens and listen in on some of the\ninformation about the future, which the angels pass among themselves.   They\nwould then return to the earth and feed the information to their human contacts. \n(\nBukhari\n).  From this it is clear that the\nJinn\ndo\nnot\nhave knowledge of the unseen, rather they steal words that they hear from the\nangels; in fact, the angels themselves do not have any knowledge of that until\nAllah tells them of it.\nThe\nJinn\nare also able to inform their human\ncontact of the future through another channel.  When someone comes to a\nfortune-teller, the fortune-teller’s Jinn gets information from the man’s\nQareen\n(the\njinn\nassigned to every human being) of what plans he had made prior\nto his coming.  So the fortune-teller is able to tell him that he will do this\nor that, or go here or there.  By this method, the real fortune-teller is also\nable to learn about a stranger’s past in vivid detail.  He is able to tell a\ntotal stranger of his parents’ names, where he was born, and his childhood.\nVisiting Fortune-tellers\nThe Prophet laid down principles which clearly forbade\nany form of visitation of fortune-tellers.  He said:\n“The prayer of whoever approaches a fortune-teller\nand asks him about anything will not be accepted for 40 days and nights.” (Muslim)\nThe punishment is for simply approaching a\nfortune-teller and asking him questions out of curiosity.\nBelief in Fortune-tellers\nAnyone who visits a fortune-teller\nbelieving\nthat\nhe knows the unseen and the future has committed\nkufr\n(disbelief).  The\nProphet said:\n“Whosoever approaches a fortune-teller and believes\nwhat he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.” (Abu\nDawud)\nSuch a belief assigns to creation some of Allah’s\nattributes with regard to the knowledge of the unseen and the future.\nThe same applies to anyone who reads the books and\nwritings of fortune-tellers, listens to them on the Internet, radio, or the TV.\nAll the various methods used around the world by\noracles, fortune-tellers, and the likes, are forbidden to Muslims.\nPalm-reading, I-Ching, fortune cookies, tea leaves as\nwell as Zodiacal signs and Bio-rhythm computer programs, all claim to inform\nthose who believe in them about their future.   However, Allah has stated in no\nuncertain terms that He alone knows the future:\n“Indeed, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone.  It is\nHe who sends down the rain and knows the contents of the wombs.   No one knows\nwhat he will earn tomorrow nor in which land he will die, but Allah is\nall-knowing and aware.”(Quran 31:34)\nAstrology\nAstrology is the study of the relationship between the\nmovements of the stars and their influence on people and events.\nAstrology has dramatically spread in recent years.  Books,\nmagazines and newspapers are published, under various titles such as"

Rather, everything that occurs can only be if Allah wills it. If He did\nnot will it to occur, it could have never come into being.\nLikewise the actions of the creation occur by\nthe Will of Allah:\n“And you do not will except that Allah wills – Lord of\nthe worlds.” (Quran 81:29)\nNo one can do anything except if Allah wills it\nto be, had He willed that they do not take place, they would not have occurred.\n(4)    Allah Created Everything\n“He has created everything, and has measured it\nexactly according to its own measurement.”\n“For it is He who creates everything and determines\nits nature in accordance with (His own) design.” (Quran 25:2)\nThis includes our characteristics and our deeds.\nThe human beings are created by Allah and so are\nthe actions and statements that result from them.  This is because the actions\nand the statements of a person are his characteristics; if the person is a\ncreation, then so are his characteristics a creation of Allah.\n“While Allah has created you and what you do.” (Quran 37:96)\nWe are given the physical ability and a choice. \nOur abilities like intelligence and memory differ just like our characteristics\nlike height, weight, and color.  Also, we are given a will and have a choice.\nIf one of them does not exist, the act would not\nbe performed.  The One who has created the choice and the ability is Allah, the\nCreator of the cause and the effect.  Since Allah has created both, the ability\nand the choice in us, hence the acts that we perform are also created by Allah.\nHuman Freedom of Will\nIslamic belief in the divine decree (\nQadr\n),\nevery human act both in material and spiritual life is predestined, keeps human\nliberty intact without denying divine interference in human affairs.  It does\nnot undermine the principle of man’s moral freedom and responsibility.  Man is\nnot a helpless creature borne along by destiny.  It is incorrect to believe the\naction of fate is blind, arbitrary, and relentless.\nAll is known, but freedom is also granted.\nMan is responsible for his acts.  Lethargic\nnations and individuals indolent to ordinary affairs of life are to blame\nthemselves, not Allah.  Man is bound to obey the moral law; and he will receive\nmerited punishment or reward as he violates or observes that law.  However, if such\nis so, man must have it in his power to break or keep the law.  Allah would not\nhold us responsible for something unless we were capable of doing it:\n“Allah does not burden any human being with more than\nhe is well able to bear.” (Quran 2:286)\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as\nyou can.” (Quran 64:16)\nEveryone knows the difference between being\ncompelled to do something and being free; having the choice of doing it, between\na gun put to one’s head and being free in making decisions.\nSome people mistakenly imagine the divine decree\nof each individual’s future life is so rigorously predetermined in all its\ndetails by Allah that his own volitions or desires have no power to alter the\ncourse of events.  It defeats common sense to reject faith or commit a sin even\nbefore knowing whether or not it was destined! Everyone has the ability to\nchoose between righteousness and evil, so how can a person willfully choose the\nroad to perdition and use the divine decree (\nQadr\n) as an excuse?  It is\nmore appropriate to walk on the blessed path and attribute it to one’s destiny. \nAllah knows from eternity with infallible certainty who will be saved and\ndoomed, while Allah has this infallible foreknowledge, we, on our part, cannot\nhave an absolutely certain assurance as to how we will end.  The Prophet, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, spoke the truth when he said:\n“Seek what is beneficial to you, and ask\nAllah for help.  Do not lose hope, and if something were to afflict you, do not\nsay ‘If I had done so and so’, because saying ‘If’ opens the doors for the\ndevil.”\n“If he is from the successful ones, then\nthe deeds of the successful ones are made easy for him.” (\nSaheeh"

Allah cautions us not to take part in such\nconversations. He says:\n“And when you see those who engage in a false conversation\nabout Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till\nthey turn to another topic.  And if Satan causes you to forget, then after the\nremembrance sit not you in the company of the wrongdoing people.” (Quran 6:68)\nMaking people afraid of his\nallies.\nAnother way Satan misguides people is to make them afraid of his (Satan’s)\ntroops and allies.  He has surrounded himself with evil minions, jinn and human\nbeings.  He instills the thoughts that they are powerful and fearsome, and if\nnot obeyed they can harm us.\n“It is only\nShaytan\nthat suggests to you the fear of\nhis supporters and friends; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true)\nbelievers.” (Quran3:175)\nSatan\nmisguides a\nperson through what he loves and desires.\nSatan finds out what we love or\ndesire and uses it against us.  He also passes this information on to his\nhelpers and they attack us with the very things we are attached to.  How often\nare our prayers disturbed by thoughts of our children or spouse? Are we guilty\nof shopping and delaying our prayer? Satan senses what we like and then sets\nabout to twist our thoughts.\nBy instilling doubts.\nShaytan\ndoes not want anyone to turn to Allah in repentance, regretting (past mistakes)\nand turning towards what is right and good.  Instead he wants to divert people\naway from Allah by using many kinds of temptations and baseless arguments.  He instills\ndoubts to make a person feel anxious and uncertain.\nThrough alcohol, gambling,\nidolatry, witchcraft and fortunetelling.\nAlthough Allah warns us against\nthese practices, human beings are weak and Satan takes advantage of this by\nmaking these practices look attractive or worthwhile.  He encourages people to\nengage in these pra"

    "fullText": "Objective\n·To understand how Islam views dreams and dream\ninterpretation.\nArabic Terms\n·\nIstikarah\n– the prayer for Guidance.\n·\nShaytan\n- sometimes spelled\nShaitan\nor\nShaytaan\n.    It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to\ndenote the devil or Satan, the personification of evil.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas\nseveral meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is\ngenerally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or\napproved.\nThe significance of dreams\nA dream\nis a series of thoughts, images and sensations that occur in the mind whilst a\nperson is asleep.  Dreams are a universal human experience and the dreamer has\nvery little control over the content.  Our experiences in dreams have very lifelike\nqualities and can be extremely vivid and often bizarre.  Some people report\nvery emotional experiences during dreams and frightening or upsetting dreams\nare often referred to as nightmares.  Throughout the history of humankind\npeople have tried to interpret their dreams and many people believe they\ncontain important messages or symbols.  There are many superstitions and\nbeliefs associated with dreams and Islam has cleared up many misconceptions\ninvolving dreams and their interpretation.\nThe scholars of Islam say that while dreams can be\nmeaningful, not all dreams should be considered important.  Ibn Siren is\nconsidered the Islamic world’s foremost expert on dream interpretation and he\ncalls it a difficult science that should be treated with the utmost care.  The importance\nof a dream is usually determined by the impression it makes on the dreamer,\nhowever most dreams have no real value and thus no need for interpretation.\nThe three types of dreams\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, told us that there are three types of dreams\n[1]\n. \nA true dream (sometimes called a good dream) that comes to us from Allah, a bad\nor frightening dream that comes from the\nShaytan\nand the third is a\ndream that comes from a person’s experiences and thoughts.  Each one should be\nmanaged differently.\nProphet Muhammad said that if anyone has a dream that he\nlikes then it is from Allah.  He should therefore thank Allah for it and\nnarrate it to others\n[2]\n.   The Prophet went\nfurther and said that if a person has a good dream, he should expect good\nthings to happen and only narrate the dream to people that he likes\n[3]\n. \nAn example of this in the Quran is when Prophet Yusuf narrated to his father the\ndream he had about the sun, the moon and the stars prostrating themselves to\nhim.  His father, Prophet Yaqub told Yusuf not to relate the dream to his\nbrothers.\n“Remember when Yusuf said to his father: ‘O my father! Verily,\nI saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon - I saw them\nprostrating themselves to me.’ He (the father) said, ‘O my son! Relate not your\nvision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.’…” (Quran\n12: 4 & 5)\nFrightening or disturbing dreams are from\nShaytan\nand are nothing more than his attempts to scare and terrify us.  Prophet\nMuhammad tells us that theses dreams will not harm a person in anyway.  Thus if\na person has a bad dream or nightmare he should spit dryly (no saliva should be\nejected) to his left three times and seek refuge from\nShaytan\nwith Allah\n[4]\n. \nHe also recommended turning over\n[5]\n.\nThe third type of dream is one that does not fit into\neither the good or bad category.   These dreams come from what a person has\nbeen thinking or worrying about or from the experiences, events and fears\nstored in the memory and the subconscious.   These dreams are of no consequence\nand there is no interpretation for them.\nRules of dream interpretation\nIt is the opinion of most Islamic scholars that dreams\nshould be interpreted only by someone that is qualified to do so.  The reason\nfor this is that the interpretation of dreams can be problematic.  Take for\ninstance a simple thing such as knowing whether the dream you had was about you\nor someone else or even someone connected to someone else.  A companion of\nProphet Muhammad’s saw in a dream the great enemy of Islam Abu Jahl becoming\nMuslim and pledging allegiance to the Prophet.  This did not happen; it was Abu\nJahl’s son who sometime later converted to Islam and vowed allegiance.  Symbol’s\nin dreams are also problematic because they mean different things to different\npeople.\nWe must be careful not to rely too much on dreams or\nbelieve that they are filled with hidden meanings and symbols.  However there\nare some dreams that are easy to interpret.  If Prophet Muhammad appears in a\ndream and looks as he is described in the\nSunnah\nthen we can be sure that\nthis is a true dream, one from Allah and full of good tidings.  The Prophet\nsaid that whoever sees him in a dream has indeed seen the truth\n[6]\n.\nIn regards to interpreting dreams as an answer to an\nIstikarah\nprayer\n[7]\n,\nthen this is an incorrect practice.  Allah does not answer this prayer through dreams."

One, they can travel very fast.  Allah tells us in the\nQuran:\n\nlfreet\nof the\njinn\nsaid, “I will bring it\nto you before you can rise from your place.  Surely, I am strong and trustworthy\nfor such work.” (Quran 27:39)\nThey can reach the skies as they are quoted to say in\nthe Quran:\n“And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled\nwith stern guards and flaming fires.“ (Quran 72:8)\nThey can take different shapes as mentioned earlier.  The\nevil\njinn\n– the devils – can possess the human body.  They can also\nwhisper thoughts and influence human beings:\n“From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in\nthe hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one’s heart after one\nremembers Allah).” (Quran 114:4)\nJinn\n’s Weaknesses\nEven though the evil\njinn\n– the devils – have\nspecial abilities, a believer is protected by Allah.  The devils cannot harm a\nrighteous Muslim by Allah’s permission.\n“Surely, My (faithful) slaves - over them you have no power; and\nyour Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)\nThe following are some examples of their limited powers:\n1.    They fear some believers.\n“Surely, My (faithful) slaves – over them you have no power,\nand your Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)\n“The believer emaciates his devil in the same way\nthat one of you weakens his camel during travel.” (\nMusnad\n)\n2.    The Prophet said that if we cover our plates\nand say ‘\nBismillah\n,’ the devils cannot take off the cover.  Similarly,\nthey cannot enter a house if we close the door saying ‘\nBismillah\n.’\n“If the man enters his house and mentions the name\nof Allah upon entering it and upon eating therein, Satan says, ‘There is no\nlodging for you here and no meal here.’ But if the man enters his house and\nneglects to mention the name of Allah upon entering it, Satan says, ‘I have\nfound lodging for you.’ And if he does not mention Allah’s name upon eating his\nmeal, Satan says, ‘I have found lodging and a meal.’ (\nSaheeh Muslim, Musnad\n)\n3.    They can take different forms, but they can\nnot take the form of Prophet Muhammad.  The Prophet said,\n“Whoever sees me in a dream will have indeed seen\nme, for Satan cannot mimic my appearance.” Abu ‘Abdullah said, “Ibn Sirin said,\n‘Only if he sees the Prophet in his (real) shape.’” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari"

It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to\ndenote the devil or Satan, the personification of evil.\n·\nShayateen\n– devils, plural of ‘\nshaytan\n’.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas\nseveral meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally\naccepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.\n·\nSurah\n– chapter of the Quran.\nWe learned in the previous lesson that some\njinn\nare good and some are evil. Allah has given them the ability to become\nbelievers or disbelievers. The evil\njinn\nare known as devils or\nshayateen\nin Arabic. The leader of the devils is known as Satan or\nIblees\nin\nArabic. He has a very ugly appearance and has two horns.\nThe Story of\nIblees\nSatan used to worship Allah with the angels before he\nbecame arrogant. He chose the evil path in life, knowing it would bring him\npunishment. Allah created Adam and ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam.\nSatan used to worship Allah with the angels, so he was also addressed to\nprostrate himself as well but he refused Allah’s order out of arrogance. As a result,\nSatan was cast out of Paradise. He made a promise to Allah that he will mislead\nthe children of Adam if Allah allowed him to live till the Day of Judgment.\nThus, he became the greatest enemy of man. He saw that Adam was the cause for his\nexpulsion from Heaven and the reason why Allah cast His curse upon him.\nMission of Satan and the Devils\nSatan, or\nIblees\n, is the Commander in Chief of\nthe battle against the earthly human beings. He lays the strategy of this\nbattle against human beings, dispatches his soldiers, and then reviews their\nperformance. He praises those who accomplish his mission. The Prophet of Allah\nhas told us,\n“\nIblees\nsets his throne on the water. From there,\nhe sends out his troops to tempt mankind. The one whom he regards as closest to\nhim is the one who causes the greatest temptation. One of them returns to him\nand says, ‘I stayed with so and so and did not leave him until he did such and\nsuch,’ and he is told, ‘You have done nothing.’ Then one comes and reports, ‘I\ndid not leave him until he separated from his wife.’\nIblees\nthen brings\nhim near to him and says, ‘How fine are you!’\n[1]\nHe has soldiers among the\njinn\n, known as devils,\nand among human beings. Among his soldiers from the\njinn\nis the\nqareen\n,\nthe devil that accompanies every human being.\nThe ultimate goal of Satan is to take human beings with\nhim to Hellfire and keep them from entering Paradise. He does this by getting\npeople to worship others besides Allah. If he cannot do that, then he leads\nthem to sin and to disobey Allah. He tries to block people from doing good\ndeeds. If he cannot do that, then he will do his best to ruin the acts of\nworship so the person will not receive any reward for them.\nOne of the means by which Satan misleads people is\nsorcery. Sorcerers can sometimes perform acts to please the devils who in turn\ndo their bidding. Sorcery is sometimes used to create a separation between\nhusband and wife (Quran 2:102). Sorcery is of two types, some of it is an\nillusion and some is real. Real sorcery can cause separation between spouses\nand cause other harms.\nProtection Against Satan and the Devils\n1.    The greatest means of protecting oneself\nagainst the devil is by sticking to the Quran and\nSunnah\nand by living\naccording to Islam’s teachings. Allah has said in the Quran,\n“O you who believe, enter into Islam completely and do not\nfollow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an open enemy to you.” (Quran\n2:208)\n2.    Seeking protection with Allah.  Actually\nturning to Allah and asking Him for protection is one of the best ways to be\nsafe from Satan.  Allah teaches us in the Quran the words of protection that\ncan be translated as,\nAnd say, ‘My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the whisperings\nof the devils and I seek refuge with You, My Lord, in case they come close to\nme.’” (Quran 23:97-98)\n3.    Place your children and property under\nAllah’s care.  Allah’s Messenger used to seek protection for his grand children\nwith these words:\n“U’eedhu-kuma bi kalimaa-til-laahit-taamah min\nkulli shaytaanin wa haama wa min kulli aynin laamah.”\n“I commend you two to the protection of the perfect\nwords of Allah, from every devil and vermin, and from every evil eye.” (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n)\n4.    The best words to seek Allah’s protection.\nThe last two chapters of the Quran,\nSurah\nal-Falaq and\nSurah\nan-Naas, are the best words to seek protection (\nSunan\nNasai\n).\n5.    Seek protection with the Verse o"

The desire to achieve\n Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all\nother desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on\nwealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of\nmaking it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of\ndevotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on\npleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One\nmust remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.\nTo be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams\nand realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!\nUltimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate\ngoal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. \nParadise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of\nGod, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence\nof pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is\nan abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel\nthe least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally\nrealized.\nIslamic Gardens\nJannah\n(a\nbeautiful garden) has historically inspired beauty, something which ca"

In order\nto enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,\nand vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise\n“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most\nable to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and\nstrength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose\ntheir youth.”\nThe faithful will enter Paradise in the best and\nmost perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their\neternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.\nThe faithful will enjoy specially crafted\nmaidens, or\nhouris\n, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of\nmortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,\nand inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public\nview in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of\ngratification.\nVision of Allah\nIn heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly\nand distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through"

Killing!”\n·The common appearance of lewd acts, working\nto bring about lewd acts, the cutting off of the ties of relationship and the\ntrusting of deceivers.\n·The disappearance of knowledge and the\nappearance of ignorance.\n·Wealth will be in abundance; so abundant\nthat a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his\nZakah\n,\nand whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be\noffered) will say, ‘I am not in need of it.’\n·The people compete with one another in\nconstructing high buildings.\n·A man when passing by a grave of someone\nwill say, ‘Would that I was in his place’.\n·Two parties of Muslims will confront each\nother and there is a large-scale massacre amongst them and the claim of both of\nthem is the same.\n·People will establish ties with strangers\nand sever relations with their near and dear ones.\n·Earthquakes will increase.\n·Any gain is shared out only among the rich,\nwith no benefit to the poor.\n·A trust becomes a means of making a profit.\n·Paying\nZakah\nbecomes a burden.\n·Men obey their wives and disobey their\nmothers; and treat their friends kindly whilst shunning their father"

More details will be given below.\n2.Rejected Intercession: This is intercession which according to\nthe texts of the Quran and\nSunnah\nis invalid and ineffective as will be explained\nin Part 2.\nThere are two types of Accepted Intercession that will\ntake place in the Hereafter:\nA. Intercession Exclusive to the Prophet\nThe first type is an exclusive intercession that which\nwill be granted only to Prophet Muhammad and no one else will share it with\nhim. It is of various kinds:\n1.The Greatest Intercession also known as\nmaqam-mahmood\nor\nthe ‘station of praise and glory.’ The earlier and later generations will ask\nthe Prophet to intercede for them with their Lord so that He might relieve them\nof the horrors of the Day of Judgement. This is the ‘station of praise and\nglory’ which Allah has promised to him in the Quran:\n“And in some parts of the night (also) offer the prayer with\nit (i.e. recite the Quran in the prayer) as an additional prayer for you (O\nMuhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to\nmaqam-mahmood\n.” (Quran\n17:79)\nThe Prophet Muhammad will intercede for all of mankind\nso that the reckoning can begin. In a narration it states that mankind will be\ndistressed and anxious and will reach a point where they can no longer bear the\nlengthy wait and will say, “Who will intercede for us with our Lord so that He\nwill pass judgement among His slaves?”  So people will come to the prophets,\neach of whom will say, “I am not suitable for this position,” until they come\nto our Prophet, who will say, “I am able to do it.” So he will intercede for\nthem that judgement may be passed.\nThis intercession belongs exclusively to the Prophet\nMuhammad.\nThere are many other reports that speak of this\nintercession: “The people will fall on their knees on the Day of Resurrection,\neach nation following its prophet, saying, ‘O So and so, intercede!’ until\nintercession is granted to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be\nupon him). On that Day Allah will resurrect him to a station of praise and\nglory.”\n[1]\n2.Intercession of the Prophet Muhammad that the believers be\ngranted permission to enter Paradise.\nThe Messenger of Allah said: “I will come to the gate of\nParadise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The\ngatekeeper will say, ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say, ‘I was\ncommanded not to open it for anyone before you.’”\n[2]\nAccording to another report narrated by Muslim, “I will\nbe the first one to intercede concerning Paradise.”\n3.Intercession of Prophet Muhammad for his paternal uncle Abu\nTalib, so that the torment of the Fire be reduced for him. This applies only in\nthe case of the Prophet and his paternal uncle Abu Talib.\nOnce, Abu Talib was mentioned in the presence of the\nMessenger of Allah. He said, “Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the\nDay of Resurrection, and he will be placed in a shallow part of the Fire which\nwill come up to his ankles and cause his brain to boil.”\n[3]\n4.Intercession that some people of his\nUmmah\nmay enter\nParadise without being brought to account.\nThis kind of intercession was mentioned by some of the\nscholars, who quoted as evidence the lengthy hadith which states:\n“Then it will be said, ‘O Muhammad, raise you head; ask,\nit will be given to you; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ So I\nwill raise my head and say, ‘My\nUmmah\n, O Lord; my\nUmmah\n, O Lord;\nmy\nUmmah\n, O Lord.’ It will be said, ‘Admit those among your\nUmmah\nwho are  not to be brought to account through the right-hand gate of Paradise.\nThey will share the other gates with the people of other nations.’”\n[4]\nB.

Allah must approve of the person for\nwhom\nintercession is made.\n“…and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is\npleased” (Quran 21:28)\nOne for whom intercession is made must be a believer in\nTawheed\nbecause Allah is not pleased with the\nmushrikoon\n(polytheists).\n.\nIt was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who will be the most\nblessed of people by your intercession of the Day of Resurrection?’ The\nMessenger of Allah said:\n“O Abu Hurayrah, I thought that no one would ask me\nabout this\nhadith\nbefore you because I have seen how keen you are to\nlearn\nhadith\n.  The people who will be most blessed by my intercession on\nthe Day of Resurrection are those who say\nLa ilaha illa Allah\nsincerely\nfrom the heart.’”\n2.  Allah must give permission to intercede.\n“Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His\nPermission?” (Quran 2:255)\n3.  Allah must approve of the\nintercessor\n.\n“…whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has\ngiven leave for whom He wills and is pleased with” (Quran 53:26)\nRejected Intercession\nThe Rejected Intercession is one that\ndoes not meet\nthe conditions\nrequired for permission from Allah or His being pleased\n(with the intercessor or the one for whom intercession is made), such as the\nintercession which the people of\nshirk\nbelieve that their gods will be\nable to do for them.  Many of them only worship their gods because they believe\nthat they will intercede for them with Allah, and that they are middle men\nbetween them and Allah.  Allah says:\n“Surely, the religion is for Allah only.  And those who take\nprotectors besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near\nto Allah.’ Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they\ndiffer.  Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever” (Quran\n39:9)\nAllah tells us that this kind of intercession is\nineffective and of no benefit:\n“So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to\nthem” (Quran 74:48)\n“And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not benefit\nanother, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be\ntaken from him nor will they be helped.” (Quran 2:48)\n“O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided\nfor you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship,\nnor intercession.  And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.” (Quran\n2:254)\nHence, Allah did not accept the intercession of His\nKhaleel\n[1]\nIbrahim for his father Azar who was a pagan.  The Prophet said:\n“Ibrahim will meet his father on the Day of\nResurrection, and Azar’s face will be dark and covered with dust.  Ibrahim will\nsay to him, ‘Did I not tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will say, ‘Today\nI will not disobey you.'’ Ibrahim will say, ‘O Lord! You promised me not to\ndisgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me\nthan cursing and dishonoring my father?’ Then Allah will say, ‘I have forbidden\nParadise to the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrahim, what is\nbeneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a\ndhabh\n(an\nanimal,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown into the\nFire.”\n[2]\nWisdom of Intercession\nThe point of intercession is to honor the person\ninterceding.  It is Allah’s way of making the person stand out in front of His\ncreation.  That is the reason why Prophet Muhammad and the prophets will be\nallowed to intercede as detailed above.\nFurthermore, intercession should not make a person\ncomplacent about sins.  A person must never think that he can rely on\nintercession and sin all he wants!  For, he is not guaranteed that Allah will\nallow someone to intercede for him.  Furthermore, his sins might lead him into\noutright disbelief in which case no one’s intercession will benefit him.  Lastly,\nhe might receive punishment before he is interceded for and released.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe word Khaleel indicates the purest, highe"

    "fullText": "Objective\n·To understand the order of events on the Day\nof Judgment and to appreciate their importance.\nArabic Terms\n·\nHadith\n-  (plural –\nahadith\n)\nis a piece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nRakah\n- unit of prayer.\nBefore we can examine the\nevents that Allah says will happen on the Day of Judgement we must ask\nourselves just when that Day will be.  And we are not the first generation to\nask that question.  Prophet Muhammad was asked many times by many people about\nwhen this Day would arrive.  The answer now, even though we have made\nremarkable advances in all forms of knowledge, particularly technology and\nscience, is still the same.  Allah alone knows when the hour that starts the\nDay of Judgement will be.  When the angel Gabriel came to the Prophet in the\nguise of a well-dressed man, one of the questions he asked was about the Hour. \nProphet Muhammad answered that, “The one questioned about it knows no better\nthan the questioner.”\n“Men ask you of the Hour, Say the knowledge of it is with\nAllah only, what can convey to you that may be the Hour is near.” (Quran 33:63)\n“Verily, the Hour is coming and My Will is to keep it hidden...”\n(Quran 20:15)\nAllah is concealing the date of the Day of Judgement\nfrom us.  This verse alone should indicate to us that this is nothing less than\na momentous occasion of gargantuan proportions.  Although we do not know when\nthe Day of Judgement will be, Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (may the mercy\nand blessings of Allah be upon him) have described in detail what will happen\non that Day.  In this and the following two lessons we will describe the events\nof the Day of Judgement as they are described to us in the Quran and the\nauthentic\na\nhadith\n.\nBlowing the Trumpet.\nThe Day of Judgment will come upon humankind suddenly.   No\nmatter how well informed or interested someone is in the signs that will precede\nit, its commencement will come as a shock.  The trumpet will be blown and the\npeople will hear a sound so horrendous that the mountains and the earth itself\nwill crumble to dust.\n“And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast, and the\nearth and the mountains are removed from their places, and crushed with a single\ncrushing, then on that Day shall the (Great) Event befall.” (Quran 69:13-15)\nAllah says that it will be a single shout, a long\ncontinuous sound that will not cease until everything has perished\n(Quran\n38:15)\n.  It will then be followed by a second blowing of the trumpet.  Behold,\nAllah tells us that everyone who has ever lived will find themselves standing,\nstaring, and shocked by the events.\n“And the trumpet will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens\nand whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills.  Then it\nwill be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on!” (Quran\n39:68)\nThe Standing\nThe trumpet is blown, the earth is rolled up like a\nscroll and the dead rise.  Bones and body parts join together, brains begin to\nwork.  Truly humankind has been returned to Allah.  All of humankind were dead,\nthose who died before the blowing of the trumpet and those who died in the\ncataclysmic event that levelled the earth to a plane.  The Day of Judgement has\nbegun.  People stand in groups, staring ahead.\n“Every soul will taste death.  Then to Us will you be returned”\n(Quran 29:57)\n“ Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes.  [We\nare] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips!” (Quran 75:3-4)\nOnce the initial shock of being returned to life begins\nto wear off, the reality of the situation begins to set in.  The veil of the\nphysical world has been removed.  The deeds we did are set out for us to see.\n“So\nwhoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.  And whoever does an atom’s\nweight of evil will see it.”\n(Quran 99:7, 8)\nAnother promise of\nAllah’s fulfilled.  Some people are happy with their situation others begin to\ntremble in fear.\nA person’s deeds will determine their length of the\nstanding but all people waiting will be  barefoot, naked, and uncircumcised.\nAhadith\ntell us that this standing in fear and trepidation could be as long as 50,000\nyears\n[1]\nbut for a\npious person it might be as little as the time it takes to pray two\nrakahs\nof prayer.  The people waiting will be frightened, their hearts beating like\ndrums in their chests and ears.  They will run about as if in a drunken state\nand care nothing about anyone but themselves.  Parents, spouses and children\nwill be long forgotten.  Gripped by fear they will begin to question their\nsituation.\n“He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind,\nwhile I had sight (before)?’ [Allah] will say, ‘This is how it is: Our signs came\nunto you, but you disregarded them, and thus will you this Day be forgotten.’”\n(Quran 20:125)\nProphet Muhammad informs us that on the Day of Judgement\nthe sun will be bought near to humankind.  The sun would only be a mile away\nand the peopl"

Raise your head; ask, for it will be\ngiven to you, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.’ I will\nraise my head and say, ‘My\nUmmah\n, O Lord! My\nUmmah\n, O Lord!’ …”\n[2]\nThis is what is known as the greatest\nintercession, it is\nal-maqaam al-mahmood\n, Prophet Muhammad\nintercedes for the people that Allah might relieve them of the horrors and\nbegin the judgement.\n“...  so that your Lord may raise you to\nMaqaam\nMahmood\n(a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on\nthe Day of Resurrection)” (Quran 17:79)\nHell and Paradise are bought close.\nBefore Judgement commences however,\nHell must be bought forth.  The angels and all of humanity are standing,\nwaiting, becoming increasingly distressed, worried only about themselves,\npleading for help and Hell is brought close.  The people are already distressed\nto the point of hysteria but those who a"

In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nSirat\n-  means path or road. In\nreference to the Day of Judgement, it refers to a long\nnarrow bridge that everyone will cross before entering either Paradise or Hell.\n·\nSunnah\n-  The word\nSunnah\nhas\nseveral meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is\ngenerally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or\napproved.\nYour new everlasting life is about to begin.  This is\nthe Day of Judgment.  All of humanity will be judged by Allah according to\ntheir beliefs and deeds. This is the culmination of the message of all the\nprophets.  Worship One God and know that you will one day be accountable for\nall that you say and do. This day has arrived. It is a shock, all of humanity are\nstanding together in awe. What happens now?\n“Verily, We have warned you of a near torment, the Day when\nman will see that (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth, and the\ndisbeliever will say: ‘Woe to me! Would that I were dust!’ (Quran 78:40)\nThe Scales of Justice\nThe scales of justice sometimes referred to as the\nbalances or the scale of deeds will be set up and each deed will be weighed and\ntallied.\nNo deed even an atom’s weight will be overlooked whether\nit be the backbiting that was forgotten or the kind word that was said without\nthinking.\n“Whoever brings a good deed shall be rewarded ten times the\nlike of it, and he that does evil shall only be rewarded the like of it, and\nthey shall not be wronged.” (Quran 6:160).\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, also reminded us of the mercy of Allah. He said, ‘There is nothing\nthat will be placed in the Balance that will weigh more heavily than a good conduct.\nThe one who has a good conduct will attain thereby the status of one who fasts\nand prays (a great deal).’\n[1]\nThe Book of Deeds\n‘…Woe to us! what sort of book is this that leaves\nneither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!’ and\nthey will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no\none with injustice. (Quran 18:49)\nEach person will be given a book in either their right\nor left hand. Everything we do in this world has been recorded by angels. The\ngood and the bad, things we have forgotten or never given a thought to, it is\nall recorded and Allah might choose to question us about each and every word.\nThose who are given the book in their right hand will begin to relax and feel\nhappy and honoured.\n“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right\nhand, He surely, will receive an easy reckoning, And will return to his family\nin joy!” But whosoever is given his Record behind his back He will invoke (for\nhis) destruction, And he shall enter a blazing Fire”(Quran 84:7-12)\nSadly though, many will receive their book in their\nleft hand or behind their back. And the fear rises.\nThe Accounting\nThe first thing that each person will be questioned\nabout is his prayer.Prayer is what is known as one of the rights we owe\nto Allah. Each person will be asked about the quality of their prayers. This is\nconfirmed and reinforced by the words of Prophet Muhammad.\nIt is recorded in an authentic\nhadith\nthat\nProphet Muhammad said, “The first thing the people will be held accountable for\non the Day of Judgment is prayer, Allah will say to His angels (even though He\nalready knows), ‘Look at my slave’s prayers. Were they complete or not?’ If\nthey were complete it will be written as complete. If they were not fully\ncomplete Allah will say: ‘See if my slave has voluntary prayers’, if he has\nthem Allah will say, ‘Complete the shortage in his obligatory prayers with his\nvoluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same\nmanner.”\n[2]\nThe words of Prophet Muhammad help us to paint a very\nclear picture in our minds of what will happen to us when we stand before Allah\non the Day of Accounting. He also said, “The son of Adam will be questioned by\nAllah about five things: how he lived his life, and how he utilized his youth, by\nwhat means did he earn his wealth, how did he spend his wealth, and what did he\ndo with his knowledge.”\n[3]\nWe should be grateful that we are able to prepare\nourselves adequately before the great Day occurs, as we even know the type of\nquestions that we will be asked and the types of behavior that we will be\nquestioned about.  The good believer prepares for this difficult event, so that\nhe or she will not be among those whose body parts testify against them.\nOn the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their\nfeet will bear witness against them as to their actions.” (Quran 24:24)\n“And they will say to their skin, ‘Why did you bear witness\nagainst us?’ They"

Between them is a barrier (\nBarzakh\n), which none of\nthem can transgress.” (Quran 55:19-20)\nAs such it is a barrier that cannot be crossed except by\nthe permission of Allah.  In the context of life and death,\nBarzakh\nis the\nperiod between a person's death and his resurrection on Judgment Day.  The very\nnature of life in the\nBarzakh\nis a matter of the\nghayb\nand thus its\ndetails are known to Allah alone.  However Allah did reveal some matters of the\nghayb\nto Prophet Muhammad and he in turn conveyed those things to us.\nAfter any burial Prophet Muhammad would remind his\ncompanions to ask forgiveness for their brother or sister, and to ask Allah\nthat they remain steadfast at the time of questioning.\n[2]\nThis was\nbecause Prophet Muhammad said that what comes after the burial could be very\ndifficult indeed.   After informing his\nsahabi\nthat the grave is the\nfirst stage of the Hereafter, Prophet Muhammad said, “…if one finds salvation\n(at this stage) the succeeding (stages) become easy for him, and if he does not\nfind salvation in it, what follows this stage is very hard upon him.” Prophet\nMuhammad’s beloved wife Aisha recalls that the Prophet used to regularly seek\nrefuge with Allah from the torment and tribulations of the grave.\n[3]\nAnd it is\nunderstood by the scholars of Islam that the tribulations refer to the\nquestioning.\nThus it would be pertinent for us to follow his example\nand seek refuge with Allah from being punished in the grave.  Prophet Muhammad himself,\nin a relatively long but very descriptive and informative\nhadith\nexplains\nvery clearly what will happen before the questioning.  It was a subject that\nthe\nsahabah\nwere very interested in and they describe themselves as\nsitting like birds, meaning they were quiet and still, when listening to\nProphet Muhammad talk about the life in the grave.\n[4]\n“\nWhen the believing\nslave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to\nhim angels with white faces like the sun, and they sit around him as far as the\neye can see.  They bring with them shrouds from Jannah (Heavenly Abode) and\nperfumes from Jannah.  Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and\nhe says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure.’\nThen it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a water-skin.  When\nhe seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant bef"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To understand the nature of the questions\nasked in the grave.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nHadith\n- (plural – ahadith) is a\npiece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, and his companions.\nThe scene for the disbelievers\nis very different.  The angels come to a disbeliever “…with dark faces,\nbringing sackcloth, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see.  Then\nthe Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O evil soul, come\nforth to the wrath of Allah and His anger.’  Then his soul disperses inside his\nbody, and then comes out cutting the veins and nerves, like a skewer passing\nthrough wet wool.  When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an\ninstant before they take it and put it in that sackcloth, and there comes from\nit a stench like the foulest stench of a dead body on the face of the earth.  Then\nthey ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is\nthis evil soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so’, calling\nhim by the worst names by which he was known in this world, until they reach\nthe lowest heaven.  They ask for it to be opened to them and it is not opened.”\n Then Allah records his place as being in the lowest depths of hell.\nOnce the soul has been reunited with the body, the dead\nperson is visited in their grave by two angels.   In an authentic\nhadith\nProphet Muhammad tells us that these angels are black and blue and named Munkar\nand Nakeer.  The angels will ask three questions that will affirm a person’s\nfaith and at the same time lay bare their piousness or wickedness.  This is a\nvery important stage because it sets the scene for the whole of a person’s life\nin the Hereafter.  The angels ask who is your Lord, what is your religion and\nwho is your Prophet? Or as in some\nahadith\nit is said that the question\nwill be who is this man who was sent amongst you?  As you can see these\nquestions concern matters of faith\n.\nIf a person answers, my Lord is\nAllah, my religion is Islam, my prophet is Muhammad … a voice calls out from\nheaven, “My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and\nclothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.” If the deceased\ndoes not know the correct answer to the questions, then a voice calls out from\nheaven, “Prepare for him a bed from Hell and clothe him from Hell, and open for\nhim a gate to Hell.  ”\nThe questioning confirms exactly what a person has\nunderstood since the moment of death.  Good really will be rewarded and evil\nwill be punished.  And thus the believer is immediately rewarded with an\nopening that appears in his grave.  Through the opening the person can see the\ngrandeur and bounties waiting for him in Paradise.  His good deeds will come to\nhim in the form of a well-dressed, handsome , finely perfumed man.  The grave\nwill be widened as far as the eye can see, it will be well-lit and filled with\ngreenery; he will long to tell his family of his good fortune.  The believer\nwill sleep peacefully in his grave.  Prophet Muhammad mentioned in a\nhadith\nthat the believer will be told to look at his place in the Hellfire and\nunderstand that it has been exchanged for a place in Paradise.  “So he will\nlook at them both.  Then his grave will be widened for him to a distance of\nseventy cubits, and it will be filled with greenery until the Day of\nResurrection”.\nIn contrast, grave of the disobedient will be filled\nwith darkness.  The disbeliever’s punishment begins with his bad deeds taking\nthe form of a repulsive looking man and an opening through which he can see the\nugliness of Hell.\nReward and punishment are mighty motivators and the\nthought of spending an unspecified amount of time being punished even before\nthe Day of Judgment arrives is a fearful thing.\nThe Prophet said “When any one of you dies, he is shown\nhis eternal abode every morning and evening.  If he is one of the people of\nParadise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the\npeople of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is\nyour abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”\nImagine hearing those words.  This is your abode until\nAllah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.  This is a moment that could\neither be filled with joy or despair for the time may be long or short, as\nAllah wills.  We have been warned and events of that day have been clearly set\nout for us.  Those of us who are wise will take heed."

the shade of the Throne of Allah.  In these\nlessons we will examine these groups of people in more detail.\nProphet Muhammad would talk to his followers about the\nDay of Judgment.  He wanted them, and us who follow him today, to be prepared\nfor what is to come.  In a famous and much quoted\nhadith\nhe reminded us\nof the boundless mercy of Allah and seven types of people who would stand\nserenely in the shade on the Day of Judgement.\n“Allah will give shade to seven [people] on the Day when\nthere will be no shade other than His (Throne's) shade:  A just ruler; a youth\nwho grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the\nmosques; two who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for that and parting\nupon that; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for illegal\nintercourse), but responds by saying, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in\ncharity and hides it, such that his left hand does not know what his right hand\ngives in charity; and finally  a man who remembered Allah in private and wept.”\n[3]\nBefore we continue, it is worth mentioning that in most\ncircumstances when ‘man’ is mentioned both in the Quran and\nahadith\nit\nrefers to both men and women; except where women or men are addressed\nseparately and specifically.\n1.A just ruler.\nJustice is a fundamental concept in Islam, along with\ntolerance, forgiveness and respect.   Justice means to give every person the\nrights he is entitled to believer or non-believer, relative or stranger, friend\nor enemy.  This is a concept that every Muslim must apply, not only the ruler. \nGod emphasizes justice, and Islam condemns all forms of injustice and\noppression.\n“…And do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being\njust.  Be just; that is nearer to righteousness”.    (Quran: 5:8)\n“…And God wills no injustice to the worlds.” (Quran 3:108)\nBeing just can put the ruler under a lot of pressure, he\nmust be careful of his own intentions and actions and he also bears some responsibility\nfor the actions taken under his authority.\n2.A youth who grew up in the worship of Allah.\nIt is the youth who are the most energetic and\nenthusiastic.  They have a zest for life and look to the future, planning and\nlaying foundations for a long and fruitful life.  Their liveliness and zeal are\ngreat blessings from Allah and those who use this time wisely to gain knowledge\nof Allah and perform acts that they may not be able to perform later in life\nwill be rewarded.  Amongst those rewards is to be shaded on the Day when there\nis no shade.  Youthfulness however is also the time when a person is most\nvulnerable to the temptations of life and the tricks of\nShaytan\n.  There\nare many worldly distractions specifically marketed to the young, so they must\nkeep their eyes on the prize and not be deluded by all that glitters and has no\nsubstance.\nWe are reminded of this in another\nhadith\nwhere Prophet\nMuhammad says, “Take advantage of five matters before five other matters: your\nyouth\nbefore you become old; and your health, before you fall sick; and your wealth,\nbefore you become poor; and your free time before you become busy; and your\nlife, before your death.”\n[4]\n3.A man whose heart is attached to the mosques.\nOnce again there are great rewards for praying in the\nmosque.  In various\nahadith\nwe are reminded of this.  For a man praying\nin the mosque has 27 times more reward than praying in the home.\n[5]\nProphet\nMuhammad said that a person… “does not take a step towards the mosque except\nthat because of it, he is raised by one rank and one sin is removed from him.  Then\nwhen he prays, the angels do not ceas"

Verily, Paradise will\nbe his abode.” (Quran 79:40-41)\nPeople enter Paradise, due generally to their\ntaqwa\nof Allah, full respect and obedience to the commands of Allah, and based on\ntheir good conduct.  Most however enter the Hellfire because of the ill use of\nthe mouth and private parts”.\n[1]\nSomething that is guaranteed to strengthen our resolve\nto stay well away from the temptation of the opposite gender is ‘fear of Allah’.\nTaqwa\nis the word often used to define the concept of fear of Allah.  Prophet\nYusuf (Joseph) was a man with\ntaqwa\n.  It is said that he will be one of\nthe leaders of the people shaded by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  His way of\ndealing with the temptation of the seductress that was his employer’s wife is a\nfine example for all of us.  When he found himself tempted by her beauty he\nsought refuge with Allah.\n“Indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her\ndesire had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.   Thus, it was that We might\nturn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse.   Surely, he was one of\nOur chosen, guided slaves.” (Quran 12:24)\n6.    A man who gives in charity and hides it,\nsuch that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity.\nCharity in Islam takes two forms:\nzakah\n, compulsory\ncharity and\nsadaqah\n, voluntary charity.\nZakah\nholds such a high\nposition that throughout the Quran it is often coupled with prayer.  Islam\nplaces great emphasis on the need to give\nsadaqah\nand\nzakah\nand\nit places great emphasis and great reward on giving these two forms of charity\nin secret.  To give in secret preserves the dignity of those who receive and it\nalso prevents the giver from seeking praise and acknowledgment.  Islam tells us\nthat giving in secret is by far the superior way but that should not detract\nfrom giving publicly which is also a very desirous and rewardable act however\ndeliberately drawing attention to one’s charitable deeds is a very undesirable\nquality.\nWealth is something that Allah can give to us at any time;\nhowever He can also take it away without even a moment’s notice.  We all know\npeople that have plunged into bankruptcy overnight.  Because of the high\nposition charity holds in Islam it is important that we spend our wealth in the\nway of Allah before we do not have the means to do so.\nThe likeness of those who spend their money for Allah’s sake,\nis as the likeness of a grain (of corn), it grows seven ears, every single ear\nhas a hundred grains, and God multiplies (increases the reward) for whom He\nwills, and Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All Knower.  (Quran\n2:261)\n7.    A man who remembers Allah in private and\nweeps.\nProphet Muhammad said, “There are two eyes which will\nnot be touched by the fire, an eye which weeps out of fear of Allah and an eye\nthat stays alert throughout the night guarding for the sake of Allah”.\n[2]\nIn the first type are those people whose eyes overflow\nwith tears when they remember Allah.  They weep when they contemplate the sins\nthat"

Adam\nAllah favored Adam (Quran 3:33) over\nother people with some great qualities:\n1.Adam was the father of all human beings.  Allah chose him to be\nthe father of all human beings as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of\nAllah be upon him, said, “All of you are the children of Adam and Adam was\ncreated from soil.”\n[1]\n2.Allah created Adam with His Hands.  Addressing Satan, Allah\nsaid, “What prevented you from prostrating yourself to the one whom I created\nwith both My hands?” (Quran 38:75).\n3.Allah created the soul breathed into Adam.  Allah had His angel,\nGabriel, breathe life into him (Quran 15:29, 38:72).\n4.Allah had the angels prostrate to Adam (Quran 15:29, 38:72).\n5.Allah gave him great amount of knowledge, surpassing what He\ngave to the angels (Quran 2:31).\n6.Allah gave him residence in Paradise along with his wife, Eve,\nand allowed them to enjoy there (Quran 2:35).\n7.Adam was the first Prophet to human beings.  Prophet Muhammad said,\n“…Adam was a Prophet and received revelation.”\n[2]\n8.Adam shared one religion with all other Prophets and called to\nthe same religion, Islam.  They all invited to belief in Allah and worshipping\nAllah alone (Quran 21:25, 16:36).\nCreation of Adam\nAllah told the angels that He was planning to establish\na ‘khalifah’\n[3]\non\nEarth.  ‘Khalifah’ is a person who is succeeded by others.  They immediately\nunderstood that it would not be Adam alone who will live on Earth, but rather,\nit would be a long chain of human beings, many of them will be wicked:\n“And (mention, O Muhammad), when your Lord said to the angels,\n‘Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.’ They said, ‘Will\nYou place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we\ndeclare Your praise and sanctify You?’ Allah said, ‘Indeed, I know that which\nyou do not know.’” (Quran 2:31)\nThe question by the angels was not meant to question\nAllah’s wisdom or a result of envy or hatred for humans.  They simply wanted to\nunderstand the purpose of Adam’s creation.  Allah’s response tells us that in\nHis perfect knowledge, He knew things about Adam that the angels could not\nimagine.\nThe angels feared that Adam was unworthy of becoming a\nkhalifah\non Earth, Allah\nproved to them that it was incorrect and the new creation can surpass them in\nknowledge.  The Quran 2:31-33 recounts that Allah taught Adam names of all\ncreated things that the angels did not know.  Allah emphasized to them that\ntheir knowledge is limited and they could only know what He taught them.  When\nAdam defeated the angels in the ‘contest of knowledge,’ he earned their respect. \nThus, they rushed to prostrate to Adam when commanded by Allah.\nMore On the Creation of Adam\nAllah tells us in the Quran 20:55 and 30:20 that He\ncreated us from soil.  Allah gathered different types and colors of soil from\nwhich Adam was to be created.  The Prophet said, ‘Indeed, Adam was created from\nthree types of solids: black, white, and red.’\n[4]\nThe soil gathered for Adam’s creation was then turned\ninto clay as mentioned in the Quran 6:2.  The clay was sticky (Quran 37:11).  After\nAdam’s clay dried, it became sort of like pottery, making a sound when tapped\n(Quran 15:26).\nAfter forming Adam’s clay, Allah fashioned it and set it\nin Paradise for a certain duration before He gave it life.  “Satan started\ncircling the clay, examining its nature.  When he realized it was hollow, he\nthought, ‘I’ll conquer this, for it is a creation that cannot hold together.’\n‘Cannot hold together’ means that he cannot control himself against desires.\nAdam was much larger in size than what human beings are today. \nThe Prophet said, ‘Allah created Adam sixty cubits tall, then mankind kept\ngetting shorter until (it reached a stable height) now.’ (Bukhari, Muslim)\nThus, human beings did not go through stages of evolution.\nIn several verses of the Quran (2:117, 3:47, 6:73,\n16:40, 19:35, 36:82.  40:68), Allah indicates that He brings into existence\nwith a mere word or command.  Sometimes, instead of fulfilling His command\ndirectly, Allah creates means for fulfilling them.  For people, Allah sends\nangels to breathe life into them.  In the case of Adam and Jesus, Allah sent Gabriel\nto breathe life into them (Quran 15:29, 38:72).\nLife was blown into Adam on Friday.  The Prophet said,\n‘Indeed, among your best days is Friday.  On it, Adam was created, and on it he\ndied.  Also, on it will be the Blow of the Horn and the Shock causing

he was a\njinn\nbut lived among the angels. \nInstead of showing remorse and repenting for his behavior, Allah says,\n“So they (the angels) prostrated themselves, except for\nIblees\n,\nwho refused, was arrogant, and (thus) became of the disbelievers.” (Quran 2:34)\nAllah gave him a chance to repent; however,\nIblees\nwent deeper into disobedience and rebellion.  To justify his arrogance, Satan\nsaid that he was better than Adam because fire is better than clay.\nAllah expelled\nIblees\nfrom Paradise as punishment.\nIblees\nrecognized that he deserved immediate\npunishment for his outright disbelief and disobedience, but he requested that\nhis punishment be postponed until Judgement Day.  Allah granted his request for\na great wisdom.\nIblees\nannounced his evil plan to mislead humanity. \nHe announced boastfully to Allah,\n“(\nIblees\n) said, ‘Because You have put me in error, I\nwill surely lie in ambush for them (humans) along Your straight path.  I will\nthen surely assault them from before them and from behind them and from their\nright and from their left, and You will find most of them ungrateful (to\nYou).’” (Quran 7:16-17)\nIblees\nblamed Allah for his misfortune, even\nthough Allah did not take away his freedom of choice.  Allah’s wisdom dictated\nthat\nIblees\nbe the trial ‘machine’ for human beings and he was given\nextraordinary powers over human beings, but it’s limitation is that he will not\nbe able to subdue Allah’s true servants.\nAllah permitted\nIblees\nto pursue his plan.  Once he has\ncompleted his evil scheme, he will abide in Hell with his followers from the\njinn\nand human beings (Quran 7:18).\nAdam and Hawwa in Paradise\nAllah let Adam and Eve dwell in Paradise, the best\nresidence.  He gave them permission to enjoy its bounties without restriction. \nHowever, Allah prohibited them from eating one specific fruit,\n“We said, ‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and\neat therefrom in abundance from wherever you wish.  But do not approach this\nvery tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.’” (Quran 2:35)\nSoon after Adam and Hawwa started living in Paradise,\nSatan unleashed his cunning deception on them.  The two were innocent and did\nnot know about lying and deception.  Satan took a false oath by Allah and used\ntheir innocence to his advantage.  Satan suggested to them that they could be\nlike the angels or live eternally in Paradise.  Adam and Hawwa were overcome\nwith desire and fell into Satan’s trick and ate from the forbidden tree.  As\nsoon as they did, their private parts became exposed (Quran 2:36).An\nimmediate outcome of disobedience is the stripping away of the spiritual\nclothing of\ntaqwa\n, hence they were punished by losing the physical\ngarments that covered their private parts.\nThey were punished by losing the physical garments that\ncovered their private"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To examine several events and learn valuable\nlessons that are applicable today\n.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nNuh\n– Arabic name for Prophet Noah.\nThe name Noah is familiar to all three monotheistic\nfaiths prevalent in the world today, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In Islam\nthe story of Prophet Noah and the flood is very similar to what is found in the\nBible, however the Quran tends to go into greater detail.   When this is\ncombined with the stories told in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad we are\nable to build up a better picture of the life of Prophet Nuh and learn some\nvery valuable lessons that are as relevant today as they were all those years\nago.\nProphet Nuh lived in a time very similar to our own.  Sin\nand lawlessness had seemingly overtaken the people.  Righteous people seemed\nvery few and those who adhered to the religion of their ancestor Adam were weak\nand often oppressed.  It sounds a little bit like the world we live in today\nwhere those who profess belief in God are often ridiculed and belittled and committing\nsin is thought of as fun.\nNuh was a charismatic speaker and enthralled the people\nwith stories of the creation and the mysteries of the universe, however when he\ntried to warn his people of a just yet terrible punishment they became angry\nand resentful.  These were the first people who had deviated from the true\nreligion yet when Nuh warned them of the punishment of Allah, his words fell on\ndeaf ears.  Despite ridicule and mockery Nuh continued, for a period of 950\nyears, to call his people back to the worship of the one true God.\nLesson 1\nDo not ever give up.\nDo not ever abandon or cut yourself off from family or\nfriends because of their disbelief, because Allah only knows when your words or\nactions might flip the switch that leads them to the path of salvation.\nWe all know the story of the flood.   It was told in\nalmost every ancient civilisation and as mentioned already, forms part of the\nreligions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Allah instructed Nuh to build an\nark and passed judgement on the disbelievers in the form of a flood.   It is a\nstory quite often thought of as a child’s story, but this story has many layers\nof meaning and is relevant for adults. Allah, the Exalted, says:\n“And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our\nInspiration and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are\nsurely to be drowned.” (Quran11:37)\nWhen the water started to fall from the sky and gush\nfrom the earth, for this was no ordinary storm, Allah commanded Nuh to enter\nthe ark with his family, the believers and a pair of every known animal, bird\nor insect.  The disbelievers watched incredulously, still jeering and mocking,\nbut the words stuck in their throats when the water began to rise, and rise,\nand rise.\nLesson 2\nThere is no power and strength except from Allah.  He is the All-Powerful. \nIf He decrees a thing, nothing can prevent it.\nWhile worldly might, strength or respect might seem of\nconsequence, the reality is that we are weak and needy; what little control we\nhave over our world and our affairs pales in comparison to the might and\nmajesty of Allah.\nNuh’s wife did not join him on the ark, for she had\nnever really believed in the message he had been preaching for so long.   Neither\ndid his eldest son, an idol worshiper who preferred to climb the highest\nmountain he could find, but the water kept rising and rising.  Prophet Nuh\ncould see his son being overtaken by the waves of water and cried out to him to\nembark the ark.   But his son refused, and he drowned.\n“And Nuh called out to his son, who had separated himself\n(apart), ‘O my son!  Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.’  The son\nreplied, ‘I will betake myself to a mountain; it will save me from the water.’ \nNuh said: ‘Today there is no refuge from Allah’s command, except for those on\nwhom He has mercy.’  And a wave came in between them so he (the son) was among\nthe drowned.” (Quran 11:42-43)\nThe examples of Nuh’s interactions with his idolatrous\nson and non-believing wife confirm the previous lessons and add a third lesson.\nLesson 3\nWe choose what we want to believe and how we want to act.\nAlthough we are undoubtedly born with an innate need to\nconnect with Allah, our spiritual identity is not a forgone conclusion.  We all\nreach an age when we can choose our faith, no matter what religion we were born\ninto.  Once chosen we then live with the consequences of that decision.\nOn his deathbed Nuh called his remaining sons to his\nside and counseled them.\n‘Indeed I would give you far reaching advice.  I charge\nyou to believe that there is no true god but Allah and that if the seven\nheavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale and the words “there\nis no true god but Allah “ were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the\nformer.  I warn you against associating partners with God and against arrogance.”\n[1]\nThe large majority of Nuh’s people rejected his message,\nbut the message survives in t"

You bring forth the dead by My leave.” (Quran 5:10)\nA miracle performed by Allah at the request of Prophet\nJesus explains why Islam says that there are two types of miracles.  Jesus\nasked Allah to provide him and his disciples with a table of food.  This event\nis discussed in\nSurah\n5 of the Quran entitled Al-Maidah (The Table Spread). \nIt is an example of a miracle performed at the request, or suggestion of the\npeople, in order to test the truth of the message.\n“Jesus, son of Mary!  Can your Lord send down to us a table\nspread (with food) from heaven?” (Quran 5:112)\nThe disciples wanted to spread the message of Jesus by\nproclaiming the miracles they witnessed with their own eyes.  Another example\nof this type of miracle is when Prophet Saleh’s people requested he bring out\nfrom behind the mountain a she-camel and her offspring.\n“We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did\nher wrong.” (Quran 17:59)\nThe second type of miracle occurs without suggestion.  It\nincludes anything similar to what happened when the tree trunk cried and longed\nfor Prophet Muhammad.   The\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad contains many\nother miracles such as water flowing from his (Prophet Muhammad’s) fingers and\ntrees deliberating shading him.  Prophet (King) Solomon’s life was also filled\nwith miracles and wonder.  His kingdom and his abilities were beyond the\ncapabilities of a human thus clearly showing that God provided him with\nmiracles that made him stand out among others and confirmed his nobility and\nprophethood.   His army consisted of battalions of men,\njinn\nand birds."

Allah\ndescribes him as such, He says:\nIndeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly\nobedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who\nassociate others with Allah. (He was) thankful for His (Allah's) Graces. He\n(Allah) chose him and guided him to a Straight Path. And We gave him good in\nthis world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. (Quran\n16: 120-122)\nLesson 1\nParents can learn from their children and elders can learn\nfrom the youth.\nKnowledge and understanding is not necessarily something\nthat comes with age and just because a person is older does not mean that he or\nshe is someone to emulate. The way Prophet Ibrahim interacted with his father\nis a very good example of a child respecting his parent yet rejecting his (the\nparent’s) ways and lifestyle.\nAnd (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father, Azar: “Do you\ntake idols as gods? Verily, I see you and your people in manifest error!” (Quran\n6: 74)\nIbrahim’s father Azar was a sculptor of idols, so from a\nyoung age Ibrahim was aware that idols were nothing more than pieces of wood or\nstone – inanimate objects that could extend no benefit or harm. He found it\nextraordinary that people would worship them as gods!\nIbrahim tried to convince his father that his practice\nof idol worship was wrong and ultimately useless. He  spoke to him in a gentle\nvoice, using kind words, and he tried to warn him of the dangers inherent in\nworshipping idols, but his father only became annoyed and then angry.\nWhen he said to his father: O my father! Why do you\nworship that which cannot hear or see and cannot avail you in anything? O my\nfather! Verily! I have received knowledge that you have not received, so follow\nme. I will guide you to a Straight Path. O my father, do not worship Satan.\nIndeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient. O my father,\nindeed I fear that you will be punished by the Most Merciful and would be a\ncompanion to Satan in Hellfire. He (the father) said: Do you reject\nmy gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop this, I will indeed stone you. So get\naway from me safely before I punish you. (Quran 19: 42-46)\nThe child feared that his father would be lost and fall\ninto the clutches of\nShaytan\n. He was wise beyond his years yet Ibrahim’s\nfather did not listen perhaps rejecting the fact that his child could guide and\nteach him. Ibrahim did not lose his temper but instead responded to his\nfather’s threatening attitude with respect and wisdom.\n[Abraham] said, Peace be upon you. I will implore my\nLord to forgive you. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me. And I shall turn away\nfrom you and from those whom you invoke besides Allah. I will call upon my Lord\nand it may well be that, in calling on my Lord, I will not be disappointed.” (Quran\n19:47-48)\nLesson 2\nIslam is logical.\nFrom the perspective of Islam Prophet Ibrahim is not\nconsidered to be either Jewish or a Christian; he is a Prophet who submitted to\nAllah and thus is a Muslim. God tells us in the Quran that from an early age Prophet\nIbrahim felt compelled to find the One God Who was worthy of worship. He\nrealized that the idols his people worshipped, that were carved and sculptured\nby his father were nothing but wood and stone. He knew instinctively that the\nsun, moon and stars were not gods of any sort. Islam tells us that worshipping\nAllah is the only logical conclusion that a person who examines the evidence,\ncan come to.  This is exactly what Ibrahim did. First he asked the wooden idols\nto respond when he spoke to them and he then destroyed them. They could not speak\nor protect themselves. Next he looked to the heavens and tried to find an\nanswer.\nSo when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star.\nHe said, This is my lord! But when it was no longer visible, he\nsaid, I do not like those that disappear! When he saw the moon\nrising, he said: This is my lord. But when it was no longer visible,\nhe said: Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the people who\nwent astray. When he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my lord.\nThis is greater. But when it set, he said: O my people! I disown\nall"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To examine several events and learn valuable\nlessons applicable in the 21st century.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nLut\n- the Arabic name of Prophet Lot.\nMany stories in the Quran\ndemonstrate the nature of Allah, some sections teach us about Paradise and Hell\nand still other parts of Quran teach us lessons. These lessons are as relevant\ntoday as they were in the time Quran was revealed or even further back in the\nhistory of humankind.  The story of Prophet Lot in both the Bible and the Quran\nare remarkably similar. The story of Prophet Lut is one that is particularly\npertinent to the 21st century yet people usually remember very little of the\nstory.\nThe story of Lut has over the centuries been reduced to\na morality tale, a parable warning people not to practice homosexuality. \nUsually all we hear is that Lut was a man of Allah living in the town of Sodom whose\npeople practiced the unnatural act of homosexuality, Allah called such\nbehaviour an abomination and destroyed the town but not before saving Lut and most\nof his family.  However Lut’s story is much more than that, it is a story\nfilled with lessons for humankind. Let us take a glimpse into his life and see\nwhat messages we are able to find and learn from it.\nLesson 1\nAllah destroyed Sodom for crimes and sins we see around us\nand accept every day.\nWe live in a world where murder is common, drugs are\nreadily available and young girls fall pregnant outside of the bonds of\nmarriage. Identities are stolen, sinful acts are called fun, and some streets\nare unsafe to walk down even in the middle of the day. Paedophilia is rampant,\nas is child pornography and human trafficking.  Degenerate lifestyles are\naccepted and thought of as normal. Alcohol is easily available even to underage\nchildren and is responsible for many of society’s ills. The people of Prophet\nLut lived in a society very similar to our own.\nThe town of Sodom was corrupt through and through. The\nmajority of people had no shame and considered sinful acts to be fun and\nfrivolity. Sodom was a party town, criminals and criminal activity abounded,\nand those passing through the town risked robbery and physical abuse. Rape was\nconsidered normal, homosexuality was considered fun and travellers expecting\nhospitality usually got more than they bargained for. Sodom was the equivalent\nof the district we avoid at night, perhaps even the suburb police will not\nrespond to in an emergency.\nLesson 2\nTo invite people to the truth with wisdom and kind words.\n“Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom  and fair\npreaching, and argue with them in a way that is better...” (Quran 16:125)\nAllah sent Prophet Lot to this town with the message to\nworship Allah alone.  He asked them to fear Allah and mend their evil ways\nsaying,\n“Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?  Verily!  I am a trustworthy\nMessenger to you.  So fear Allah and obey me” (Quran 26:161 - 163).\nLot\nspoke using mild words; he condemned the actions not the people themselves and\nencouraged them to seek forgiveness. There is surely a lesson for us in this.\nLot spoke mildly to people Allah described as evil and disobedient, thus we\nshould remember this when we are confronted with the evil acts people in the 21\nst\ncentury think of as fun. Condemn the act, not the person.  This was also the\nway of Prophet Muhammad; he too would speak harshly about the action, not about\nthe person who did the action.\nLesson 3\nAllah is the All-Seeing.\nSadly however, in Sodom, Lut’s words fell on deaf ears\nbecause the people were content with their corrupt ways and had no desire to\ncurb them.  The people of Sodom committed their sins openly and had no shame,\nthey cared not whether anyone saw their sinful actions so it did not bother\nthem that Allah was watching. No matter whether we try to disguise or hide our\nsins Allah sees everything, nothing can be hidden from the Almighty. Thus if we\nare ashamed of our actions and wish that Allah did not witness our behaviour it\nis  probably time to rethink,  and  find a way to act that is more pleasing to Allah.\nLesson 4\nBelievers should be hospitable.\nWhen the angels came into the town of Sodom they\nappeared to the people as very attractive male travellers. The first person they\nspoke to was one of Lut’s daughters. She was afraid for them and asked that\nthey wait for her father in order for him to see them to safety. When Lut met\nthe strangers he could not convince them to bypass the town so he tried to keep\nthem safe in his own home.  Lut did not know that his guests were angels sent\nby Allah, yet he feared for them more than his own safety. When the men of\nSodom rioted outside his house, demanding that the strangers be delivered into\ntheir hands, Lut opposed them.\nThe goodness in hospitality comes from giving for no\nother reason than to please Allah. The person you help may never be in a\nposition to help you and in some cases he may even bring you harm, however in\nIslam hospitality is a triangular relationship between the host, the stranger\nan"

One amongst them\nhowever felt the error of their ways and suggested that rather than killing\nYusuf\n,\nthey should cast him into a well.  When found by some passing traveller he\nwould be sold into slavery, thus rendering him as good as dead to the family.  They\nalso believed, in their blindness, that the absence of Yusuf would remove him\nfrom their father’s thoughts.\nAllah had other plans, so while the brothers\ncongratulated themselves, He established Yusuf  in the land of Egypt in order\nto teach him wisdom and understanding.  The pain and suffering Yusuf felt being\nseparated from his father and the frightening ordeal of being sold into slavery\nwere trials designed to mould Yusuf’s character.  They were Yusuf’s first steps\non the ladder to greatness and they established him as a Prophet of Allah.  The\nplots and plans of the treacherous brothers were inconsequential.\nLesson 2\nTrue\nsabr\nis a key to the gates of Paradise.\nWhen Yusuf’s brothers returned to their father and told\nhim Yusuf had been taken by a wolf, Yaqub’sheart constricted in pain\nand fear.  He knew his sons were lying but he had no option except to face that\nfear with complete submission to Allah.   He turned to Allah with hope and\npatience.  This type of\nsabr\nis what Islam calls\nsabr jameel -\nbeautiful\nsabr\n.\n“Nay, but your own selves have made up a tale.   So (for me)\npatience is most fitting.   And it is God (Alone) Whose help can be sought\nagainst that which you assert.” (Quran 12:18)\nThroughout the many years until Yaqub saw his dear son Yusuf\nagain, he never gave up hope.  At one time when his sons asked if he would\nweep\nforever\nhe replied that he only complained of his grief and sadness to Allah,\nand that he knew, due to his total reliance on Allah, things that they did not\nknow.\nLesson 3\nComplete trust in Allah must be practiced consistently, in\nall situations, good, bad, easy, or difficult.\nIf we accept that we are no more than slaves of Allah,\nput on this earth, to be tried, tested and tempted, life can take on a\ncompletely new meaning.   Both Yusuf and his father Yaqub recognized that God\nwas the one thing in their lives they could totally rely on.\nDuring his time in the house of one of the top Ministers\nof Egypt Yusuf was forced to fend of the sexual advances of his\nbenefactor/master’s wife.  Yusuf called out to Allah for help.  He said,\n“O my Lord"

They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\nThe lives of all the\nProphets of Allah are filled with lessons.  Some lessons are as applicable\ntoday as they were in the era in which they were experienced.  The Prophets\ncame with lessons to be learned and understood, messages, and laws.  Sometimes\nthe laws changed to accommodate a particular time and place but the main\nmessage that they conveyed was the same.  They instructed their peoples to\nworship God alone, and not associate anything or anyone in worship with Him.  The\nstories of the lives of the prophets emphasize this basic doctrine of Islam\nthat God is One.\nThe story of Prophet Ayub is a little different from the\nothers that we know.  Through his story, we are able to view humankind’s\nstruggle on a more personal level.  Allah does not tell us about Job’s methods\nof preaching or how his people reacted to his warnings and admonitions.   God\ndoes not tell us about the fate of Ayub’s people.   Instead, He tells us about Ayub’s\nsabr\n.   He (the Almighty) praises Job by saying,\n“Truly!  We found\nhim patient.   How excellent a slave!  Verily, he was ever oft returning in\nrepentance to Us!” (Quran 38:44)\nLesson 1\nTo have\nsabr\nAt this point you are probably thinking that all the\nProphets we have discussed so far in this series of lessons have demonstrated\nsabr\nand of course you would be correct.   It is one of the most important lessons\nto learn and to practice.  However Allah, the Most-Wise uses Prophet Ayub’s story\nto touch on some areas that otherwise might be overlooked in the study of the\nProphets of Allah and their patience.  Ayub’s story is one of\nsabr\n, no\ndoubt about that, however not patience for minutes, hours, or even days.  Prophet\nAyub was patient for years, literally, with not even the smallest break.  The\nscholars differ about just how many years but it seems that seven is the\nminimum number of years.  Prophet Ayub bore all difficulties with patience.  To\nlearn more about Prophet Ayub’s suffering and unwavering patience, please see:\nhttp://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2721/\nLesson 2\nIs our sincerity and worship of Allah dependent upon His\nblessings on us?\nHappiness and afflictions are both tests from Allah.  We\nface trials and we experience triumphs.  If we remember Allah in our times of triumph,\nwill we still worship with sincerity when we are faced with loss or suffering. \nThis is just what\nShaytan\nintends to find out when he suggests that\nAllah removes Ayub’s blessings of wealth, health and family.   Job was\ncommitted to daily prayer and would frequently thank Allah for blessings He had\nbestowed on him but\nShaytan\nwas convinced that Ayubwould turn\naway from his Lord when he was faced with intense suffering, illness and\ndistress.  Allah knew his faithful slave would never turn away from his faith\nso He allowed\nShaytan\nto afflict Ayub with many calamities one after the\nother.\nAllah makes it very clear that children and wealth are\nmerely adornments of this brief life and that He will test us through our love\nfor them.\nWealth and children are the attractions of this worldly life,\nbut lasting good works have a better reward with your Lord and give better\ngrounds for hope.  (Quran 18:46)\nHe can take the adornments of life away from us as\neasily as He can provide them for us, thus we should never rely on this worldly\nlife, or feel secure.  In the story of Ayub, Allah teaches us that worldly\ntreasures are ultimately worthless; so never allow the adornments of this\nmaterial life to take over your heart nor lose sight of what is important. Do\nnot give preference to the material realm and put aside your worship and\nreverence to your Creator.\nLesson 3\nNothing happens without the Will of Allah.\nAllah used the life of Prophet Ayub to teach\nShaytan\na lesson.   It is a lesson that we too can take benefit from.  The lesson is\nthat Allah is the controller of all affairs.  Human beings,\nJinn\nor\nShaytan\ncan plot, or simply make plans, but none of them will come to fruition\nwithout the permission of Allah.  When you read a more complete story of\nProphet Ayub you will notice that\nShaytan\nknew this and sought\npermission to test Prophet Ayub.\nProphet Ayub understood that whatever calamities befell\nhim, they were happening with the permission of Allah.  He also had complete\ntrust in the Mercy of Allah knowing that if he loved and trusted Allah even\nmore in the t"

Tur, Allah conferred Prophethood on Musa and engaged him in a\nshort but remarkable conversation.  It was a conversation that taught Musa\nlessons about himself, about his world, about the nature of humankind and about\nthe nature of Allah.  To this day it continues to teach important lessons to\nhumankind.  On a daily basis, the words of the Quran change lives.  The lessons\nlearned in the story of Musa are as relevant today as they were thousands of\nyears ago.\nThe story of Musa teaches us the importance of trusting Allah;\nit demonstrates that Allah’s plans will overcome any triumph, test, or trial,\nand it shows us that there is no relief from the torments of this world except with\nremembrance and through seeking nearness to Allah.  Reading and studying the\nlife of Musa reveals that Allah can replace weakness with strength and failure\nwith victory; and that Allah supports the righteous from sources we can barely\nimagine.\nEgypt in the lifetime of Musa was the known world’s\nsuperpower.  Wealth and power were in the hands of very few, and the lives and\nlifestyles of the majority were of very little consequence.  The political\nsituation was in some ways similar to the political world of the 21st century. \nIn a time when the young people of the world are used as cannon fodder for the\npolitical and military games of the most powerful, the story of Musa is\nparticularly pertinent.  It teaches us how to obey the commands of Allah and it\nteaches us how to survive in a world where religion is less important than\npower and acquisition.\nTo read more detailed information about the life of\nProphet Musa go to:\nhttp://www.islamreligion.com/articles/3366/viewall/\nLesson 1\nEstablish the\nsalah.\nMusa had extraordinary strength of character, even as a\nrelatively young man he had developed the ability to persevere even in the direst\ncircumstances.  He had fled Egypt under the threat of death, trudged across the\ndesert and found a new life in a new land but later circumstances pulled him\nback to the land of his birth.  In the dark of the night, in the shadow of a\nmountain the light of a fire drew Musa into an amazing dialogue.  Imagine his\nshock and surprise when he found himself engaged in a conversation with Allah,\nthe Al-Mighty.  After commanding that Musa removes his shoes, Allah reminded\nhim of humankind’s obligation to Him.\n“Verily!  I am Allah!  none has the right to be worshipped but\nI, so worship Me, and establish prayer (\nsalah\n) for My Remembrance.  (Quran\n20: 14)\nIn this conversation\nsalah\nwas prescribed upon Musa\nand his followers.\nSalah\nwas also prescribed upon Prophet Muhammad and\nhis followers in much the same way.  Allah establishes a direct connection\nbetween Himself and Musa before He revealed Musa’s mission to the court of the\npharaoh of Egypt.  Before Allah commands Musa to face his biggest fear He says,\nworship Me and remember Me, because I am able to replace weakness with strength\nand failure with victory; I will support you from sources unimaginable.\nSalah\nforges a connection between Allah and the person who prays and it means that\none is never far from the protection of Allah.  In this day and age when our\nfears about the future tend to overwhelm us, an unbreakable bond is a thing of\ncomfort and joy.\nLesson 2\nAllah hears our prayer and supplication.\nMusawas a man of honour.  Even after walking\nacross the Egyptian desert exhausted and dehydrated he was able to put the\nneeds of others before his own.  Instead of sinking down in the shade of a tree\nat a desert oasis he helped two young women who were trying to water their\nflock of sheep.  However, when his task was finished he sat down heavily and\nappealed to Allah for help.  He said, “O Lord, whatever good you can bestow on\nme, I am surely in need of it”.  Before his supplication was finished, the help\nfrom Allah was on its way.   Musa was probably hoping for a slice of bread or a\nhandful of dates but instead Allah gave him safety, provisions and a family.  A\nperson must never despair of Allah hearing his prayer and supplication.   We\nare never alone, just as Musawas not alone when he fled from his land leaving\nbehind everything.\nLesson 3\nIf a person accepts that there is no true god but Allah no\nsin is unforgiveable.\nOne part of the story of Musa that has intrigued people\nfor centuries is the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of the Egyptians. \nWhen Pharaoh had power, wealth, good health and strength he refused to\nacknowledge Allah.  He denied the signs and ridiculed, belittled and threatened\nP"

Verily, I have turned my face towards\nHim Who has created the heavens and the earth, away from idolatry, and I am not\nof those who associate others with God.” (Quran 6:78)\nThus Ibrahim proved to his satisfaction and the\nconsternation of his peers that the Lord of the worlds was not to be found in\nthe creations that their idols represented, but was, rather, the entity who\ncreated them and everything which they could see and perceive; that the Lord\ndoes not necessarily need to be seen in order to be worshipped.  He is an\nAll-Able Lord, not bound by limitations as the creations found in this world are.\n“And We verily gave Ibrahim of old his proper course.”\n[2]\nHowever, despite these proofs his people still argued\nwith him.\n[3]\nThey\nsaid:\n“Nay, but we found our wise fathers acting in this way.”\n[4]\nHe denied that one’s ancestors are necessarily right, or\nthat we should slavishly follow their customs, by saying:\n“Verily you and your fathers were in plain error.”\nHis message was simple:\n“Worship God, and keep your duty to Him; that is better for\nyou if you did but know.  You worship instead of God only idols, and you only\ninvent a lie.  Lo!  Those whom you worship instead of God own no provision for\nyou.  So seek your provision from God, and worship Him, and give thanks to Him,\n(for) to Him you will be brought back.”\n[5]\nThen the time came when preaching had to be accompanied\nwith physical action.  Ibrahim planned a bold and decisive blow at idolatry, a\nplan which had hinted involved their idols,\n“And, by God, I shall circumvent your idols after you have\ngone away and turned your backs.” (Quran 21:57)\nIt was time for a r"

And Isa answered him, ‘The first of all the\ncommandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.’“\nIn the Quran, Prophet Isa says,\n“… ‘I\nhave come to you with wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the\n(points) on which you dispute.  Therefore, fear Allah and obey me. Indeed,\nAllah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.  This is a straight path.’”\n(Quran 43:63)\nIn the words from the King James Bible,\nwhen one of Isa’s disciples asked him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught\nhis disciples.” He replied, “When you pray, say: ‘Our Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is\nin heaven.  Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us the wrong we have\ndone as we forgive those who wrong us.  Subject us not to the trial but deliver\nus from the evil one.’“ (Luke 11:1-4, Matthew 6:9-13)\nIsa was\nteaching his followers what Christianity refers to as “The Lord’s Prayer”, a\nprayer that Christians esteem in much the same way as Muslims think of the\nopening chapter of Quran,\nAl-Fatihah\n.\nLesson 3\nA brotherly bond exists between Prophets Isa\nand Muhammad\nLike Isa son of Mary, the Prophet\nMuhammad came to confirm the message of all the Prophets before him; he called\nthe people to worship the One God.  In his\nSunnah\nProphet Muhammad\nrefers to the relationship that exists between all of the prophets of Allah as\na brotherhood. But when he spoke about Prophet Isa, he said:\n“I am nearest\nto the son of Mary in this world and the Hereafter.  There is no prophet\nbetween him and me.\n“\n[1]\nHe also said,\n“Whoever testifies\nthat there in none worthy of being worshipped but God, Who has no partner, and\nthat Muhammad is His slave and Prophet, and that Jesus is the Slave of God, His\nProphet, and His word\n[2]\nwhich\nHe bestowed in Mary and a spirit created from Him; and that Paradise (Heaven)\nis true, and that the Hellfire is true, God will eventually admit him into\nParadise, according to his deeds.”\n[3]\nGod says in the Quran:\n“Jesus, Son\nof Mary, is only a Messenger of Allah, and a fulfilment of His command, 'Be',\nwhich He conveyed to Mary, and he is a soul from Him, like the souls of the\nrest of humans.”\n[4]\nLesson 4\nSocial justice\nBoth Prophets Muhammad and Isahad\nstrong and uncompromising visions of social justice.  They both fought against\ninequalities and injustices in their respec"

 She, however, simply prayed to Allah for\nhis release, to demonstrate that only He has the power, if He wills, to protect\nher.  Only after a failed third attempt did he finally let her go.  Sarah\nreturned to Ibrahim, accompanied by Hagar, a gift from Pharaoh to propitiate one\nso protected by Allah.  She had delivered a powerful message to the pagan\nEgyptians, yet still the Pharaoh misdirected his propitiation, which should\nhave been directed towards Allah.\nLoaded with gifts, Ibrahim returned to Palestine.  Yet Sarah\nand Ibrahim continued to be childless, despite divine promises that he will\nhave many descendants.  Driven by altruism, Sarah suggested that Ibrahim take\nHagar, her handmaiden, as a second wife to bear him a child on her behalf.  While\nin Palestine, Ibrahim married Hagar who bore him a son, Ishmael.\nWhile Ishmael was still nursing, Ibrahim was commanded\nby Allah to take Hagar and Ishmael to a barren valley of Bakka 700 miles\nsoutheast of Hebron.  In later times it would be called Mecca.  Ibrahim left\nthem there with a skin of water and leather bag full of dates.  As Ibrahim\nbegan walking away leaving them behind, Hagar became anxious about what was\nhappening.  Ibrahim did not look back.  Hagar chased him,\n‘O Ibrahim, where\nare you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company\nwe can enjoy, nor is there anything here?’\nIbrahim hurried his pace.  Finally,\nHagar asked,\n‘Has Allah asked you to do so?’  Suddenly, Ibrahim stopped,\nturned back and said, ‘Yes!’\nFeeling a degree of comfort in this answer,\nHagar asked,\n‘O Ibrahim, to whom are you leaving us?’  ‘I am leaving you to\nAllah’s care,’\nIbrahim replied.  Hagar submitted to her Lord,\n‘I am\nsatisfied to be with Allah!’\n[2]\nShe\ntraced her way back to little Ishmael.  Ibrahim left with prayers for his wife\nand child, which he prayed when he was out of sight.\nSoon, the water and dates were gone and Hagar’s\ndesperation increased.  Unable to quench her thirst or to breastfeed her little\nbaby, Hagar began searching for water.  She began climbing the rocky incline of\na nearby hill.  ‘Maybe there is a caravan passing by,’ she thought to herself. \nShe ran between the two hills of Safa and Marwa seven times looking for signs\nof water, and then she heard a voice.  Looking down in the valley, she saw someone\nstanding next to Ishmael.  It was the angel Gabriel,  who hit the ground next\nto the baby with his heel as she came rushing down the hill, and water came\ngushing out.  It was a miracle!  Hagar tried to make a basin around it to keep\nto from flowing out and filled her skin.\n‘Do not be afraid of being\nneglected,’ the angel said, ‘for t"

    "fullText": "Lesson Objectives:\n·To understand that Islam commands unity and\nshuns division.\n·To understand that all sects are not equal:\nthere are sects with “small” mistakes, but are still Muslims and then there are\ncults which call themselves Muslims, but are universally acknowledged to be\nnon-Muslims.\n·To learn the Islamic guidance on how to\navoid confusion.\n·To understand the importance of the “\nSahabah\n”.\nArabic Terms\n·\nSahabah\n- the plural form of\nSahabi, which translates to Companions.  A\nsahabi\n, as the\nword is commonly used today, is someone who saw Prophet Muhammad, believed in\nhim and died as a Muslim.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word Sunnah has several\nmeanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally\naccepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.\nWhile the majority of Muslims share the same fundamental\nbeliefs, with 1.62 billion adherents –close to a quarter of planet Earth’s\npopulation\n[1]\n– distributed over the far stretches of the continents and among 49 countries\nwhere Muslims are a majority and a history of more than a thousand years, all people\nwho call themselves Muslims are not exactly the same.  There are sometimes\nsignificant religious differences between them.  In the following two lessons, we\nwill cover the following points in more detail:\nDo the existence of sects mean that Islamic teachings\n(contained in Quran and\nSunnah\n) mandate them? The answer is no.  What is\nimportant is to realize that unlike other religions, Allah has taken upon\nHimself to protect Islam - the last revelation and the most complete religion\nof God to humanity.  You will not find any promise from God in the Bible or\nalmost any other religious text that He will protect it.  On the other hand,\nyou do find two important promises from God in the Quran:\n“God has completed His religion of Islam” (Quran 5:3)\nGod will protect and safeguard His religion form change (Quran\n15:9)\nThe existence of sects is due to reasons whose\ndiscussion is beyond this lesson.\nAll Sects are Not Equal: An Analogy of Circles\nAn analogy can better explain the issue of sects.  The\nQuran and\nSunnah\nsit at the center around which there are many circles. \nSome Muslims will lie within a circle, but others will lie outside of it.  In\nother words, some Muslims will be closer to the center, others may be distant. \nThen, think of a red circle which is so far from the center that anyone who\nlies outside of that red circle is not even considered a Muslim.  The radius of\nthe circle is a measure of how “deviant” the sect is.\nIn other words, the most “deviant” sects, one can call\nthem cults, will be outside of the red circle.  They will be the ones that have\nthe most serious conflict with the established Islamic beliefs and practices.  Examples\nwould be Ahmadis, Bahais, and the Druze.\nSects Are Confusing, Who Do I Follow?\nWhat becomes confusing is that with the existence of\ndifferent sects, who does a new Muslim follow, especially when most sects claim\nto follow the Quran and\nSunnah\n.  What is a new Muslim to do? How does he\nor she determine who is right and who is wrong? In simple words, how does a new\nMuslim avoid confusion? Let us break down the answer to this question in a few\npoints:\nFirst\n, if we go back to the Quran and\nSunnah\n,\nwe will find the answer to this question.  You see, the Quran and\nSunnah\nare texts; some will try to take the Quran alone, separating it from the\nSunnah\n(Prophetic traditions). They would then interpret the Quran they way they like.\nThe only way to properly understand the Quran is by going back to the Prophetic\ntraditions and to understand both in light of the understanding of the people\nwho were present at the time of revelation.  These texts were revealed in their\ntime, many of the texts were addressed to them\n[2]\n,\nand they had the best teacher (the Prophet of Allah) to explain to them anything\nthat needed explanation.  Let us see what the Prophet said regarding this\nmatter,\n“The best of people is my generation, then those who\ncome after them, then those who come after them.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh\nMuslim)\nThe Prophet distinguished the first three generation of\nMuslims to be the “best.” If they are the “best” according to the Prophet of\nIslam, then it makes sense that we understand and practice Islam the way the\n“best” people understood and practiced Islam.\nSecond\n, it is important to know that the first\ngeneration of Islam is known as the generation of the “\nSahabah\n.” The\nword “\nsahabah\n” means “companions” in Arabic.  Its singular is “\nsahabi\n,”\nwhich means a “companion.” The second and third generation also have names, but\n“\nsahabah\n” is the most important term to know for now.\nThird\n, it is important that one not judge for\nhimself who is Muslim and who is not. When one lacks the proper knowledge,\nissues such as this should be left to the scholars. There are some sects that\ndo have good and bad incorporated into their beliefs. Take Sufis\n[3]\nas an example. \nAll their beliefs and pr"

Even\nwithin a sect, there are sub sects that vary greatly in their teachings.\nKeeping this in mind, below is a brief discussion of some sects:\n1.Ahmadis\n[1]\nAhmadis or Qadiyanis are a missionary-oriented sect of Indian\norigin, founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1839-1908). The Qadiyanis currently have\na presence in many countries, including most Western countries. Their world\nwide numbers are estimated as high as 10 million. Even though their\nheadquarters are in Pakistan, they have a strong presence in London, UK.\n2.Ismailis\nAlso known as “Sevener Shi'ites.” The Ismailis reject\nthe Quran and all forms of prayers found in the main Sunni Islamic tradition.\nThis frees them from obligations such as prayer, fasting, and hajj. They are\nmostly located in Pakistan, North-west India and the Chinese province of\nSin-Kiang. The Khojas, a sub-sect, are mainly to be found in Gujarat, India.\nThere are also Khoja communities in East and South Africa. They are also found\nin the Western countries. Most Ismaili businesses put the picture of Prince\nKarim Agha Khan, their leader, at a prominent place in their shop.\n3.Bahais\n[2]\nBahais follow the teaching of Bahaullah ('splendor of\nGod') (1817-1892). They attract followers by speaking of unity of humanity and\nthe absolute equality of men and women. Bahais see themselves working towards\nthe establishment of a world government which will eradicate extremes of wealth\nand poverty. The writings of Bahaullah are treated as sacred. It is estimated\nthat there are between 3 to 4 million Bahais in the world today, spread in most\ncountries of the world with the largest concentration in India. In Iran the\nBahais remain the largest minority group with about 300,000 adherents. The\ninternational Baha'i center is in Israel.\n4.Shias\n[3]\nAlso spelled “Shi’ites.” The “Twelver Shias” believe\nthat, after the death of the Prophet, the Imamate (the political and religious\nleadership of the Muslim community) should have gone to 'Ali - the cousin and\nson-in-law of the Prophet - and his descendants as a divine right.\nUnlike\nthe Sunnis, who perform prayers five times a day, the Shi'ites pray three times\na day. The Twelver Shias population in 1980 was estimated to be 73,000,000.\nThey are dominant in Iran, but are also found in Pakistan, India, Iraq,\nLebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Syria. There are also small Shia communities\nin the West, one of the largest in Dearborn, Michigan.\n5.Nation of Islam\n[4]\nThe Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace Muhammad in\nDetroit in 1930. The group believes that a person called Fard Muhammad was “God\non earth.” It sees Elijah Muhammad as the Messenger of Truth.\nWarith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad, brought the group closer to\nmainstream Sunni Islam. Some dissatisfied members were led by Louis Farrakhan,\nwho revived the group in 1978 with the same teachings of Elijah. They only\nallow people of black ethnicity in and believe they are the original race on\nearth. They are especially popular in the prison system in the US.\n6.Submitters\nFounded by Dr. Rashad Khalifa, an Egyptian computer\nscientist. Submitters consider Rashad Khalifa to be a Messenger of God. They\nreject two verses of the Quran, preach the “miracle of 19,” and reject the\nhadith"

Before discussing\nbidah\nin any depth we must\ndistinguish between two types of\nbidah\n. The first type is innovation in\nthe matter of things pertaining to our worldly life. Things like technology,\nelectricity and transport would come under this category. These things are\npermissible and in many cases could even be called desirable. The second type\nof innovation pertains to matters of the\ndeen\n. In matters of religion\nbidah\nis not permissible and it can be dangerous to introduce new things in our\nreligion. Because of the danger there are many quotations and traditions from\nthe\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad that point this out.\n“Whoever innovates into this affair of ours\nsomething that we have not commanded, it is to be rejected”.\n[1]\nThe best speech is the Book of Allah and the best\nguidance and example is that of Muhammad, and the worst of all things are the\nnewly invented things (in the religion), for every religious innovation is an\nerror and a misguidance.”\n[2]\n“…Every religious innovation is a means of\nmisguidance and every means of misguidance is in the fire.”\n[3]\nThe\ndeen\nof Islam has no need for\nbidah\n. The\nreligion of Islam is complete and there is no need to introduce or invent new\nmatters in the religion. This is confirmed by the Quranic statement\n“This\nday I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and\nhave chosen for you Islam as your\ndeen\n” (Quran 5:3)\nWhen a person innovates something and adds to the\ndeen\nsomething that does not already belong to it, he implies that the religion is\nlacking and in need of improvement, or the implication is that Allah did not\ncomplete and perfect it His religion. This is clearly not the case as we can\nsee from the above verse.\nWhy is it important to avoid\nbidah\nWhilst Allah does not punish a person who falls into\nerror due to ignorance we are obligated to educate ourselves to the best of our\nability. The reality is that Allah will not accept an action that does not\nfulfil two important conditions. The first condition is that the action be done\nwith a sincere intention to please Allah almighty. The second is that the\naction is done according to what is taught in the Quran and the authentic S\nunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad. The action must conform to the\nSunnah\nand not be in\ncontradiction to it.\nWith this in mind let us revisit the meaning of\nbidah\n.\n Linguistically, it means creating or inventing something new, something\nwithout precedence.  Legally, it is to add something new to the\ndeen\nof\nAllah. Even if the action is invented as a way of drawing closer to or\nworshipping Allah it still does not become acceptable. It is still a sin.\nHow do we know if an act of worship is really an act of\nbidah\n?\nOn many occasions you will hear it said that Islam is a\nreligion of informed knowledge. This implies that believers do not take things\non face value. A believer takes the time to learn and understand the details of\nthe\ndeen\nand he learns to question actions or sayings that are not\npresented with clear evidence. If he takes the time to learn Islam a person is\nable to recognise what is a\nSunnah\naction and what is\nbidah\n.\nThe following are six ways to distinguish between a\nSunnah\nand a\nbidah:\n1.An act of worship related to a cause or reason that has not been\nlegislated:\nIt is not\npermissible to link an act of worship to a cause or reason that has not been\nlegislated in the Quran or the authentic\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad.  An\nexample of this would be waking up to pray at night during the seventh day of\nthe Islamic month of\nRajab\nwith the belief that Prophet Muhammad\nascended to the heavens on this night. The act of praying in the night is\nsomething that is legislated in Islam with sufficient evidence from the Quran\nand\nSunnah\n, however when it is linked to this reason it becomes a\nbidah\nbecause it is based and constructed upon a reason which is not established from\nthe\nShariah\n.\n2.Type of worship:\nIt is also essential that the act of worship agrees with\nthe\nShariah\nin its type.

If a person decided to\npray five\nrakahs\nof prayer for the\nDhuhr\nprayer this would be a\nbidah\n.\nWe know that this prayer consists of four\nrakahs\n; this is what is\nlegislated and to introduce an extra unit of prayer would be considered an\ninnovation, a\nbidah\n.\n4.Manner of performance of worship:\nAnother way of distinguishing between something that\noriginates in the Quran and the\nSunnah\nand an innovation is to look at\nthe manner of performance. That is, how do we perform the act of worship, is it\nin accordance with what the\ndeen\nof Islam teaches, or have we overstepped\nthe boundaries and added something to a religion that has already been\nperfected. An example of this is making ablution before prayer in an incorrect\norder, such as beginning with washing the feet instead of finishing with this.\n5.Time of worship:\nThe time we perform an act of worship is also important.\nIf a worship is performed according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and\nthe specified time, then it does indeed please our Creator. However if a person\ntakes it upon himself to change the specified time then that person has fallen\ninto the sin of\nbidah\n. For example, sacrificing sheep in the month of\nRamadan\nwith the intention of seeking a reward similar to the reward for sacrificing on\nEid ul-Adha\nthen this would be considered an innovation.\n6.Place of worship:\nThe place in which the act of worship is performed\nshould also be in accordance with what has been legislated. If, for example a\nperson was to make\nitikaf\nin his home this would not be acceptable. The\nplace for\nitikaf\nis the mosque, thus performing it in any other place\nwould be considered a\nbidah\n.\nA list of common innovations\n·Seeking help from the occupants of the grave.\nThis\nbidah\nis of particular importance because it also encompasses\nshirk\n,\nthe greatest sin in Islam.\n·Sitting in groups and saying words of\nremembrance of Allah, such as Allahu Akbar, in unison.\n·Taking the birthday of the Prophet as an\nEid\n.\n·Fasting on the fifteenth of the Islamic\nmonth of\nShaban\nand spending that night in prayer.\n·Celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad,\nmay the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.\n·Reciting Quran to benefit the deceased (this\nincludes hiring people to recite Quran).\n·Wiping over the back of the neck when making\nablution.\n·The family of the deceased preparing food\nfor others who visit.\nWhat is a “good\nbidah\n”?\nOn occasions you might hear  of something called a ‘good\nbidah\n’. According to Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him,\n“… there is no such thing in Islam (in the religious sense) as a good\nbidah\n.”\n[1]\nThe sheikh also emphasised that “…with regard\nto ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called\nbidah\n(innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic\nterms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not\nthe things that the Prophet was warning us against”. In addition to this noted\nIslamic scholar Imam Ibn Rajab\n[2]\nsaid, “Any words from our righteous predecessors considering something as a good\nbidah\nwere meant in a linguistic sense and not the Islamic sense”.\nIn conclusion\nbidah\nis a newly invented belief or\naction in the\ndeen\nof Islam by which closeness to Allah is sought but it\nis not supported by any authentic proof"

More specifically, in Islam it\nrefers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of\nworship.\n·\nTawheed\n- The Oneness and Uniqueness\nof Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and in His\nright to be worshipped.\n·\nHadith\n- (plural –\nahadith\n) is a piece\nof information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the sayings and\nactions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nFajr\n- the morning prayer.\nIntroduction\nLinguistically, theterm\nAdhan\nmeans “a\nproclamation”, and this is what is meant in the verse of the Quran:\n“And a\nproclamation\n(adhan) from Allah and His\nmessenger to all people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free\nfrom (all) obligations to the polytheists, and so is His messenger.” (Quran\n9:3)\nIn religious context, the\nadhan\nis that proclamation\nmade, consisting of specific “words of remembrance”, the time for an obligatory\nsalah\nhas begun. Throughout the Muslim world and in some places in the\nWest, the caller to prayer announces five times a day from every mosque that it\nis time for prayer, to remember Allah, and to put aside all the cares of life\nto prepare for the worship of the Giver of Life.  The prayer “God is the\nGreatest” resonates through all semblances of civilization, through small towns\nto metropolises.\nThe\nadhan\ncovers all the essentials of the Islamic\nfaith in a few words:\n1.    It begins by proclaiming the greatness of\nAllah.\n2.    It testifies to Allah’s\ntawheed\nand\nHis exclusive right to worship.\n3.    It denies\nshirk\n– the worship of\neverything besides Allah.\n4.    The\nadhan\ntestifies that Muhammad, may\nthe mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, is the Messenger of Allah.\n5.    It mentions belief in one of the greatest\npillars of Islam: the\nsalah\n(ritual prayer).\n6.    Invites to the prayer and equates it with\nprosperity, salvation and success (in the hereafter)\n7.    It affirms the reward for\nsalah\n:\nprosperity for one who singles out Allah in\ntawheed\n, follows His\nMessenger, establishes the\nsalah\nand other pillars of Islam.\n8.    It implies the loss of one who does not\nrespond to the\nadhan\nand does not pray.\nHistory of\nAdhan\nThe\nadhan\nwas prescribed during the first year after\nthe Prophet migration to Medina.  It was taught in true visions to two\ncompanions and made part of Muslim life by the Prophet himself.  Abdullah ibn\nZaid, a companion of the Prophet, reported:\n“When the Prophet was\nto order the use of a bell to call the people to prayer, he disliked it because\nit resembled the Christian practice.  While I was sleeping, a man came to me carrying\na bell.  I said to him, ‘O slave of Allah, will you sell me that bell?’\nHe said, ‘What would\nyou do with it?’\nI replied, ‘I would\ncall the people to prayer with it.’\nHe responded, ‘Shall I\nnot guide you to something better than that?’\nI said, ‘Certainly.’\nHe said, ‘You should\nsay:\nAllahu akbar, Allahu\nakbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar\nAshhadu alla ilaha illal-lah,\nashhadu alla ilaha illal-lah\nAshhadu anna\nMuhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah,\nashhadu anna\nMuhammadar-Rasool-lal-lah\nHayya ‘alas-salah,\nhayyah ‘alas-salah\nHayya ‘alal-falah,\nhayya ‘alal-falah\nAllahu akbar, Allahu\nakbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’\nThen he went a short\ndistance away and said, ‘When you stand for the prayer, say:\nAllahu\nakbar,\nAllahu akbar\nAshhadu alla ilaha\nillal-lah\nAshhadu anna\nMuhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah\nHayya ‘alas-salah,\nhayya ‘alal-falah\nQad qaamatis-salah,\nqad qaamatis-salah\nAllahu akbar, Allahu\nakbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’\nWhen the morning came, I went to the Messenger of\nAllah to tell him what I had seen.  He said, ‘Your dream is true, Allah willing. \nGo to Bilal, tell him what you have seen, and tell him to make the call to\nprayer, for he has the best voice among you.’ I went to Bilal and told him what\nto do, and he made the call to prayer.  ‘Umar was in his house when he heard it. \nHe came out with his cloak, saying ‘By the One who has raised you with the\ntruth, I saw similar to what he saw.’ The Prophet said, ‘All praise is to\nAllah.’”\n[1]\nThe Prophet appointed two companions to call the\nadhan\nin Medina in his mosque: Bilal, a former African slave whose freedom was bought\nby Abu Bakr, and Ibn Umm Maktum for the\nadhan\nof\nFajr\n.  He also\nappointed Abu Mah-zura in Mecca and Sa’ad al-Qaraz in Q"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To appreciate the role of the mosque in\nMuslim life in the West.\n·To learn 6 etiquettes of attending the\nmosque.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nMasjid\n- the Arabic term for mosque.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling\nMuslims to the five obligatory Prayers.\n·\nAs-Salamu Alaikum -\npeace and\nblessings be on you.\n·\nSalam\n- The Islamic greeting such as\n'\nAs-Salamu Alaikum\n'.\nThe\nmasjid\n, translated as\nmosque in English, is the heartbeat of the Muslim society in Islam. In the\nWest, most often Muslims buy land and build a\nmasjid\non it. Other times,\nthey buy a church or some other building and convert it into a\nmasjid\n.\nSometimes, they even rent a room, garage, or a basement and use it as makeshift\nmasjid\n.\nIn all cases, a\nmasjid\nis a place for Muslims where\nthey meet one another daily to perform the prayers and also to conduct other\nacts of worship and activities that are beneficial for the Muslim community.\nThe most important act of worship done in the\nmasjid\nis the Friday prayer. Five daily prayers are also offered in most of them. Many\nmasjids\nwill have a dedicated\nimam\n, a prayer leader, who will\nlead the daily prayers. Some of them do not have a dedicated\nimam\n, but one\nof the attendees will lead the prayer when the prayer time comes. Similarly,\nthe regular\nimam\nmight also deliver the Friday sermon and lead the\nprayers or there might be different speakers who rotate weekly and deliver the\nFriday sermon.\nProphet Muhammad taught us that the\nmasjids\nare houses\nof Allah and that certain etiquettes and rules should be learned and observed\nby every Muslim who attends them.\nFollowing are some of the etiquettes and manners of a\nmasjid\n:\n1.    Worship is the first priority. The primary purpose\nof going to the\nmasjid\nis to worship the One true Lord of the heavens\nand the earth. Everything else is secondary. Many mosques provide gaming and\nsocial events like basketball, community dinners, picnics, etc. They are all\nworthwhile, but serve a secondary purpose. The\nmasjid\nis primarily a\nplace for the worship of Allah and that typically means prayer and reading or\nreciting the Quran.\n2.    The general rule is that a Muslim should be\nclean, wear clean clothes, and not smell bad when he or she comes to the mosque.\nHe should avoid everything that has an offensive smell like that caused by eating\nraw garlic, raw onions, or smoking.\nA Muslim should also wear clean clothes and socks when\nhe comes to the\nmasjid\n. Not only do bad smells bother fellow human\nbeings, but they also offend the angels who are present. Remember, that a\nmasjid\nis the house of Allah after all.\nIf a person performs work that makes him sweat or other\nbodily odors, then he should take a shower and change clothes before coming to\nthe\nmasjid\n. It is reported that the Prophet Muhammad said:\nWhoever eats garlic or onion, then he must\nkeep away from our\nmasjid\nbecause the angels get offended from what\noffends the children of Adam. (Saheeh Muslim)\n3.    A Muslim should enter the\nmasjid\nwith\nhis right foot first, and then say what was reported from Prophet Muhammad:\n“\nAllah-hum-maf-tah lee abwaaba\nrahmatik\n.”\n“O Allah, open the gates of your Mercy\nfor me.”\nThis supplications is optional, however saying it is a\nrewarding act.\nThe Prophet liked to start with his right side in everything.\nThe famous companion of Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Umar, in imitation of the Prophet\nused to step with his right foot first when he entered the\nmasjid\n, and\nstep out with his left foot first when he walked out of the\nmasjid.\n(\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n).\n4.    In order to keep the carpet clean, where people\nput their faces, it is appropriate to remove one's shoes before entering the\nprayer hall. This goes for children as well, who may drag dirt all over the\ncarpet - not to mention that they shouldn't be running around inside the prayer\nhall.\nMany mosques have a rack for shoes that should be\nutilized to keep the space clear of shoes in walkways and other spaces. It also\nmakes it easier to find shoes later on.\n5.    A Muslim should greet people by saying “\nAs-Salamu\nAlaikum\n” to the people in the\nmasjid\nas he enters it, even if he\nsees the people are praying. He does not have to shout it out. Saying it in an\naudible voice is enough. The Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say “\nAs-Salamu\nAlaikum\n” to the Prophet while he was praying, and he used to reply with a gesture.\nThere are many reports about that. For example, Suhaib, a Companion of the\nProphet, said: I passed by the Messenger of Allah while he was praying\nand gave\nSalam\nto him, (and) he replied to me with a gesture. (Nasai)\nIn another instance, Ibn Umar asked Bilal, another\nCompanion of Prophet Muhammad, ‘How did you see the Prophet reply to the Companions\nwhen they said\nSalam\nto him while he was engaged in prayer? Bilal\nsaid: By spreading his palm. (\nTirmidhi\n)\n6 . A Muslim should try to be punctual in arriving for\nthe Friday prayer, the regular prayers, or attending lectures and classes. Late\narr"

benefits of\nnafl\nworship.\n·To learn about the commonly prayed voluntary\nprayers.\nArabic Terms\n·\nFajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha\n– the\nnames of five daily prayers in Islam.\n·\nFard\n– an

prayer.\n·\nTasleem\n– the salutation of peace\nthat ends the prayer.\n·\nDuha\n– name of an optional prayer\ndone during the daytime.\nThe first thing to understand is the difference\nbetween what is known as\nfard\nand what is known as\nnafl\n.\nFard\nis obligatory, it is what Allah requires us to do, and leaving it is a sin and\nwe will be held accountable for it.  An example is two\nrakah\nof\nFajr\nprayer.\nNafl\nliterally means ‘extra’.\nNafl\nworship is not\nrequired from a Muslim, rather it is up to the individual to offer it.  It is\noptional and voluntary.  The Muslim is not sinful for neglecting\nnafl\n,\nbut is rewarded for doing it.  Therefore,\nnafl\nworship is recommended.  Examples\nof\nnafl\nprayers will be covered in this lesson.\nA word of advice about the voluntary prayers.   Add them\nslowly to your daily, obligatory prayers.  You must first focus on the five\ndaily, required prayers and make sure you are praying them regularly and on\ntime.  Add them step by step, do not burn yourself out, and at the same time do\nnot neglect the voluntary prayers.\nBenefit of\nNafl\nPrayers\nThe Prophet said: “The first thing that the people will\nbe called to account for on the Day of Resurrection will be the prayers.  Our\nLord will say to the angels although He knows better: ‘Look into the prayer (formal\nobligatory prayer) of my servant to see if he observed it perfectly or has been\nnegligent in it.’ So if he observed it perfectly it will be recorded to his\ncredit, but if he had been negligent in it in any way, Allah would say: ‘See if\nMy servant has any extra prayers.’ Then if he has any extra prayers, Allah\nwould say: ‘Make up the deficiency in My servant’s obligatory prayer with his\nsupererogatory prayers.’ Thereafter all his actions will be examined in like\nmanner” (Abu Dawud).\nTwo Types Of\nNafl\nPrayers\na)    General\nnafl\nprayers:  One can pray\nthem whenever one likes and there does not have to be any reason or cause for\nit, neither are they restricted to any given number.   However it should be\nnoted that the general\nnafl\nprayers should not be offered at the time\nwhen performing non obligatory prayers is prohibited or disliked.\nb)   Specific\nnafl\nprayers:  These prayers are\nassociated with a specific reason or cause.\nExamples of Commonly Prayed Specific\nNafl\nPrayers\nAs-Sunan ar-Rawatib\n(often simply referred to as  ‘\nSunnah\nprayers’)\nThey are voluntary prayers that are associated with the\nobligatory prayers and have a specific order and number.  The ones often prayed\nare listed below:\nName of Prayer\nRakah\nof\nFard\nPrayer\nRakah\nof ‘\nSunnah\nPrayer\n’\nBefore\nFard\nRakah\nof ‘\nSunnah\nPrayer’\n  After\nFard\nFajr\n2\n2\nDhuhr\n4\n4 (2+2)\n2\nAsr\n4\nMagrib\n3\n2\nIsha\n4\n2\nThe\nMessenger of\nAllah said:\n“Whoever prays twelve\nrakah\nduring the day and night\nwill have a house built for him in Paradise: four\nrakah\nbefore\nDhuhr\nand two after it, two\nrakah\nafter\nMaghrib\n, two\nrakah\nafter\nIsha\n, and two\nrakah\nbefore\nFajr\n.” (\nTirmidhi\n)\nThe Prophet said\nabout the two\nrakah\nbefore the obligatory\nFajr\nprayer\n, “They\nare dearer to me than the whole world.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\n“The Prophet never left praying four\nrakah\nbefore\nDhuhr\nand two\nrakah\nbefore\nFajr\nunder any\ncircumstances.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nWitr\nPrayer\nThe Prophet prayed and encouraged others to pray the\nWitr\nprayer.  It is a\nnafl\nand highly emphasized optional prayer, and according\nto some scholars it is a required prayer.\nIt is offered after\nIsha\nprayer and can be prayed\nbefore the time for\nFajr\nprayer starts.\nIt is permissible to perform the\nWitr\nby:\n1.Praying two\nrakah\nlike any other two\nrakah\nprayer,\nconcluding them with\ntasleem\nand then praying one more\nrakah\nand ending\nthe prayer with\ntasleem\n.\n2.Praying three\nrakah\ncontinually (\nwithout\nsitting\nafter the second\nrakah\nas in\nMagrib\n) and then concluding the\nprayer with\ntasleem.\n3.One\nrakah\nand ending the prayer with\ntasleem\n.\nTahiyya-tul-Masjid\n(Prayer for Entering the Mosque)\nIt is a prayer in which two\nnafl\nrakah\nare\nperformed at the time of entering the mosque.  The Messenger said,\n“If\nanyone of you enters a mosque, he should pray two\nrakah\nbefore sitting.”\n(\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nSalat at-Tawba\n(Prayer of Repentance)\nAllah’s Messenger\nsaid,\n“There is no man who, upon committing a sin, purifies himself and\nperforms two\nrakah\n, then asks for forgiveness from Allah, but Allah\nforgives him” (\nAbu Daud, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah\n)\nDuha\nPrayer\nAbu Dhar reports\nthat the Prophet said:\n“Charity is required from

A\nwajib\n(obligatory act) is waived if one\nforgets, and it can be compensated for by doing the “prostration of\nforgetfulness” (will be discussed later).\nIn this lesson we will first learn the\narkan\n(essential\ncomponents).\nEssential Components (\nArkan\n)\nof\nSalah\n1. Saying ‘\nAllahu Akbar\n’ at the beginning\nThe Prophet said to a person who prayed incorrectly, “then\nface the\nqiblah\nand say\nAllahu Akbar.\n”\n[1]\n2. Reciting\nSurah\nal-Fatihah\nThe Prophet said,  “There is no prayer for someone who\ndoes not recite the Opening of the Book (\nSurah\nal-Fatihah).”\n[2]\n3. Standing during obligatory prayers if one is able to do so\nBased on the verse,\n“and stand for Allah with\ndevotion.” (Quran 2:238)\nAlso, the Prophet said, “Pray standing; if you are not\nable to; pray sitting, if you are not able to; pray (while lying) on your side.”\n[3]\n4. Bowing\nThis is based on the Prophet’s saying to the person who\nprayed incorrectly,  “then be at ease until you are at ease in bowing.”\n[4]\nAnd remaining in that position until you attain\ncalmness.\nSpeaking about the importance of this matter, he said, “The\nworst people are the thieves who steal part of the prayer.”  He was asked how\nthis was done, and he replied, “He does not complete his bowings and\nprostrations,” or he said, “He does not straighten his back during his bowings\nand prostrations.”\n[5]\n“The prayer of one who does not straighten his back in\nhis bowings and prostrations is not accomplished.”\n[6]\n5. Rising up from bowing\nThis is based on the\nhadith\n, “then rise till you\nare standing straight.” (Bukhari, Muslim)\n6. Prostration\nThis is based on the\nhadith\n, “then prostrate till\nyou are at ease in prostration.”\n7. Sitting between the two prostrations\nThis is based on the\nhadith\n, “then rise up till\nyou are at ease sitting.”\n8. Attaining calmness\nA person prayed too fast without attaining calmness. The\nProphet disapproved his speed and said, “you did not pray.”\nAttaining calmness means that each body part assumes the\nappropriate position before one moves from one position to another.\n9. Reciting the final\ntashahhud\nThis will be done in the final sitting of the prayer. The\nwords of the\ntashahhud\nwere taught by Prophet himself.  Ibn Mas’ud said,\na companion of the Prophet, said, “Before it was made obligatory to say the\ntashahhud\n,\nwe used to say, ‘Peace be upon Allah, and peace be upon Gabriel and Michael.’\nThen the Messenger of Allah said, ‘Do not say that but say, ‘All compliments\nare for Allah…’”\n[7]\n.\n10.   Sitting to recite the final\ntashahhud\nThis will be the final sitting of the prayer.\n11. Sending blessings on the Prophet after the final\ntashahhud\nThis is to be done after reciting the final\ntashahhud\n.\n12. Saying ‘\nAs-Salamu\n’\nAlaikum\nwa-Rahmatullah\n’ to conclude the prayer\nIn an obligatory prayer it has to be said twice, however\nin the funeral prayer it is sufficient to say it once.\n13. Order\nAll the “essential components” of salah need to be\nperformed in the correct order.\nActs That Invalidate the Prayer\nThere are certain acts that if done, would invalidate\nthe prayer. What that means is that a person has to start over the prayer from\nthe beginning.\n1. Being certain that you broke the\nwudoo\nA man complained to the Messenger of Allah about feeling\nsomething  (in his abdomen) in the prayer. The Prophet said, “Do not turn away\n(from\nsalah\n) unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.”\n[8]\nThis does not mean you only turn away from\nsalah\nwhen you hear a sound or notice a smell. As long as you are\nsure\nyou\nbroke wind and passed gas, your\nwudoo\nis broken and  you must make it\nagain and start the prayer from the beginning.\n2. Intentionally not performing a\nrukn\nor prerequisite\nof prayer without a valid excuse\nThis is based on the Prophet saying to the man who did\nnot pray properly, “Go back and pray for you h"

In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling\nMuslims to the five obligatory Prayers.\n·\nNafl\n- a voluntary act of worship.\n·\nRuku’\n- the bowing position in\nprayer.\n·\nRakah\n-  unit of prayer.\n·\nFajr\n- the morning prayer.\n·\nDhuhr\n- the afternoon prayer.\n·\nSutrah\n-  a barrier a person puts in\nfront of him while praying.\n7.    A person must not rush to catch up prayer\nthat is in progress at entering the\nmasjid\n, because the Prophet forbade\nrushing in such a situation. Prophet Muhammad said:\n“If the prayer started, then do not join it\nrunning, but join it walking and do it calmly, and pray whatever you caught up\nwith, and make up for what you missed.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nIf a Muslim arrives late to a prayer, he should say “\nAllahu\nAkbar\n” and join the congregation. If a\nrakah\nwas joined after\nruku’\n,\nthen the entire\nrakah\nneeds to be repeated after the prayer. So when the\nimam finishes with the prayer then you should stand up and make-up what you\nmissed.\nIt is appropriate to join the back row and fill in all\nthe spaces. If there is no more room, then a new row should start directly\nbehind the imam, and more latecomers fill out to the right and to the left.\nSisters should begin a new row in front if the row starts in the back.\n8.    One should keep quiet during the prayer. During\nthe congregational prayer, there is no good reason for making a lot of noise\nwhile people are trying to pray, yet conversations can sometimes be heard\nduring the prayer! Children should be trained to stay near their parent in prayer\nif possible, or if not, they should not be brought to the\nmasjid\nto pray.\n9.    The Muslim should not distract others praying\nin the\nmasjid\n, because a person in prayer is in contact with Allah.\nCausing distraction is quite a serious matter - people should not be disturbed\nby actions such as reciting the Quran loudly.\n10.  The one who enters the\nmasjid\nshould\nnot sit until he prays two\nrakahs\n. You pray them the same way you pray\nthe two\nrakahs\nof the obligatory\nFajr\nprayer. The reason you pray\nthem is to show respect to the\nmasjid\nbefore sitting down. The Prophet\nsaid:\n“When one of you enters the\nmasjid\n, he\nshould pray two\nrakah\nbefore sitting down.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh\nMuslim\n)\n11.   If\nan individual is praying outside of the congregation (optional prayers, or obligatory\nprayers alone), he should place something in front of him during prayer as a\nbarrier between himself and the passersby in front of him. It can be a chair, a\nwall, or a pillar. He should also come a little close to it as the Prophet used\nto do. Prophet Muhammad said:\n“If you pray, then pray toward a\nsutrah\n(barrier) and get close to it.” (\nAbu Daud\n)\nIt is not necessary to have a barrier in front of a\nperson if praying in congregation, except for the\nimam\n, whose barrier\nacts for the congregation.\n12.  Muslims are not supposed to walk in front of a\nperson praying. If a person is praying with a\nsutrah\n(barrier), let’s\nsay behind a chair, then you cannot walk between the person and the chair, but\nbeyond the chair. Prophet Muhammad said: “If one knew (the sin) of passing in\nfront of one who is praying, he would rather wait for forty than to pass in\nfront of him.” Abu al-Nadr - one of the\nhadith\nnarrators, said: “I do\nnot remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years.” (Bukhari,\nMuslim)\n13.  The Muslim should sit where he finds a place\nin the\nmasjid\n. The Muslim should not jump over people or squeeze himself\nbetween two people who are already sitting so as not to bother or harm them. Many\nahadith\nof the Prophet convey this meaning.\n14.   Instead of chatting and gossiping, it is\nbetter for a Muslim to keep himself busy supplicating and remembering Allah,\nbecause he is considered as if in the prayer as long as he is waiting for the\nprayer.\n15.  The Muslim should keep the\nmasjid\nclean\nand tidy, and fragrant because it is the house of Allah. The Prophet considered\nspitting in the\nmasjid\nto be a sin that could be forgiven only if the Muslim\ncleans the area. The Prophet of Islam said:\n“Spitting in the\nmasjid\nis a sin and its\nexpiation is to clean it.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nThe Companions of the Prophet used to keep the\nmasjid\nclean, like the famous Companion, Ibn Umar, used to put perfume inside the\nmasjid\nwhen Umar, his father, sat on the pulpit to deliver Friday sermon (Abu Daud). Traditional\nincense or modern day sprays and electric devices can be used for the purpose.\n16.  The Muslim should not walk out of the\nmasjid\nafter the\nAdhan\nhas been given before he prays that prayer with other Muslims\nin congregation. Let us say you have prayed\nDhuhr\nearlier at home or\nanother\nmasjid\n, then you go to"

The prayers are obligatory on every Muslim\nman and woman five times a day throughout their life once they declare Islam.  The\nprayer (\nsalah\n) is the second pillar of Islam, after the two Testimonies. \nWhether one is rich or poor, healthy or sick, traveling or resident, a Muslim\nmust pray.\n[2]\nEvery\nMuslim should learn the rules and regulations of praying correctly and pray\nfive times a day.  Learning and performing the prayer should be the first\npriority of every new Muslim.  If you are new to Islam, incorporating a new\nreligious practice done in an unfamiliar language may feel strange and intimidating,\nbut soon with patience and Allah’s help it will become part of your life.  Prayer\nto a Muslim is as important as breathing, and  it isn’t as difficult as it may\nseem!\nThe prayer revolves around three supreme\nrealities in a Muslim’s life: Allah, His Prophet, and the community of\nbelievers.  Allah is constantly praised, glorified, thanked, and remembered in prayer\n(\nsalah\n).  A Muslim turns himself inwardly and outwardly to Allah.  The\nmethod of the prayer is that of the Prophet in which he is mentioned as well.  Lastly,\nthe prayer ties one to the community of the faithful, especially when performed\nin the mosque with a local congregation.\nThe prayer (\nsalah\n) is considered the most\nimportant act of worship prescribed for human beings.  It is the backbone of\nreligious observance of a Muslim. Without a spine, the human body would\ncollapse. Similarly, without the prayer a person’s Islamic practice would fall\napart. The Prophet himself compared it to the spine:\n“The head of all affairs is Islam, its\nspine is the prayer (\nsalah\n)…”\n(Al-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)\nEmphasizing its importance, the Prophet said:\n“Between a person and disbelief is discarding\nthe prayer (\nsalah\n).”\n[3]\nWhat this means is that if a man stops to pray\ncompletely, he slides into disbelief.\nThere are quite a few other points which emphasize\nthe importance of the prayer (\nsalah\n), from them the following:\n- The Prophet at his death bed advised the\nMuslims to pay attention to\nsalah\n.\n[4]\n- It was the first act of worship made\ncompulsory on Muslims who were required to observe the prayer while in Mecca\nbefore migration to Medina.  Compulsory charity (\nZakat\n[5]\n),\nfasting, and pilgrimage were made compulsory in Medina.\n- The first matter we will be questioned about\non the Day of Judgment is\nsalah\n:\n“The first matter which a slave will be\nheld to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer (\nsalah\n).  If it\nis good, all the rest of his deeds become good, but if it is bad, all the rest\nof his deeds become bad.”\n[6]\n- Abraham asked his Lord to give him descendants\nwho would abide by their prayers:\n“My Lord! Cause me and (some) of my offspring to\nremain constant in prayer.  And O our Lord!  Accept my supplication” (Quran 14:40)\nThe Quran is full of commands to pray to\nemphasize its importance.  The prayer has been divinely transmitted to us in\ntwo ways.  First, Allah Himself commanded Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, when he ascended into the heavens in a journey\nknown as the\nMi’raaj\n(The Ascension).  The commandment for the prayer (\nsalah\n)\nwas not brought down by an angel to the Prophet, but the Prophet was taken up\nto the heavens, and Allah addressed him directly in its obligation.  Second,\nthe great angel Gabriel descended to teach the Prophet the five prayers and\ntheir times.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSalah\n:\nThe prescribed actions and words said between the pronouncement of\nAllahu\nAkbar\nand closing with\nAs-Salamu ‘Alaykum\n.\n[2]\nThe\nrequirements are flexible for the sick and the traveler.  A menstruating women\nis excused from the prayer.  We will learn about them later, God-willing.\n[3]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[4]\nAs\ncollected by Imam Ahmad, Nisai, and Ibn Majah.\n[5]\nCompulsory charity required of wealthy Muslims.\n[6]\nTabarani\n#???"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To understand how the Friday prayer is\nconducted and who is required to pray.\n·To appreciate the wisdom behind the Friday prayer.\n·To learn the virtues of the Friday prayer.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nSalat ul-Jumuah\n- Friday prayer.\n·\nDhuhr\n- the afternoon prayer.\n·\nKhutbah\n- sermon.\n·\nKhatib\n- person delivering the sermon.\n·\nRakah\n- a unit of prayer.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling Muslims\nto the five obligatory prayers.\nOn Fridays, the\nDhuhr\n(afternoon\nprayer) is replaced with a what is known as\nSalat ul-Jumuah\n.\nSalat\nul-Jumuah\nconsists of a short sermon and a congregational prayer. The Friday\nprayer\ncannot\nbe done at home or prayed individually. That is why\nMuslims gather in a central mosque to pray and listen to a sermon, known as\nkhutbah\nin Arabic. It is common for a designated\nImam\n(prayer leader) to give\nthe\nkhutbah\n, but sometimes this is done by invited guests or general members\nof a community.\nIn the West, sermons are mostly delivered\nin English, however sometimes they are only in Arabic. In any case, at least\npart of the sermon is always in Arabic. The sermon is made of two parts. After\nthe first part is over, the\nkhatib\n(person delivering the\nkhutbah\n)\ntakes a short break and sits, and then resumes it. The quality of a sermon\ngreatly differs depending on the speaker who might be a knowledgeable scholar\nof Islam or a lay person. The speaker will praise Allah and then discuss issues\nrelevant to the Muslim community. Afterwards, the\nImam\nwill lead the\ncongregation in a short prayer of two\nrakahs\n.\nSalat ul-Jumuah\n(the\nsermon and the prayer), usually lasts for an hour or less.\nMen Must Pray\nSalat ul-Jumuah\nThe Friday prayer is compulsory and\nrequired from all Muslim\nmen\n. This is based on the Quran in which Allah\nsays,\n“O you who believe, when the call to prayer (\nAdhan\n)\nis proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and\nleave trade aside. That is better for you, if you did but know.” (Quran 62:9)\nProphet Muhammad has stated very\nclearly who is required to pray\nSalat ul-Jumuah\nand who is exempt:\n“The Friday prayer in congregation\nis an obligatory duty on every Muslim except four: a slave, a woman, a child,\nand a sick person.”\n[1]\nTo be precise, Friday prayer is\nrequired from every Muslim male who has reached puberty. Others can attend it,\nbut are not sinful if they don’t.\nAdditionally, Prophet Muhammad has\ngiven a stern warning against missing the Friday prayers. He said,\n“People should stop missing Friday\nprayers otherwise Allah will put a seal on their hearts and thus they will be\namong the heedless.”\n[2]\nA Muslim man who is sick or travelling\nmay miss the Friday prayer. A Muslim woman is not required to pray the Friday\nprayer, but she is allowed to attend the prayers if she wants to. Most mosques have\nseparate seating arrangements for women, but some may lack women’s area for\npraying the Friday prayer. Also, the women who decide not to attend the\nSalat\nul-Jumuah\nshould offer the regular\nDhuhr\nprayer at home.\nWisdom Behind Friday Prayer\n1.    The Friday prayer brings\nlocal Muslims together in one place on a fixed day, thereby increasing the\nbonds of brotherhood between Muslims.\n2.    The purpose of the\nkhutbah\n(sermon) is to educate the Muslims and serves as a weekly reminder about their duties\nto Allah and fellow human beings. It warns against sin and disobeying Allah,\nand encourages to be good and to obey Allah.\n3.    The topics are varied and\noften update the Muslims on current affairs and as Muslim what should be their\nrole.\nVirtues of Friday\nFriday is a virtuous day with many\nspecial qualities.\n1.    Prophet Muhammad said:\n“When it is a Friday, the angels\nstand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons\ncoming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of\nthe one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a\ncamel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a\nram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out\n(for the Friday prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the\nKhutbah\n.”\n[3]\nThis narration shows the reward of\ncoming early to the Friday prayer. The earlier a person arrives, the greater\nhis reward. The first arrival attains the reward of sacrificing a camel for\nAllah, but those who arrive later receive lesser rewards.\n2.    He also said:\n“The best day on which the sun has\never risen is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted into\nParadise, and on it he was expelled from it, and the Hour will not be\nestablished except on Friday.”\n[4]\nThe purpose of this narration is to tell\nus of the magnificent events that took place on Friday or will take place.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nAbu Dawood\n[2]\nSaheeh Muslim\n[3]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[4]\nSaheeh Muslim"

In this lesson, we will describe how to\nperform ablution in a little more detail, and mention the\nahadith\nfrom\nwhich this method is derived.\nArabic Terms\n·\nNafl\n- a voluntary act of worship\n·\nHadith\n- (plural –\nahadith\n) is\na piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nWudoo\n– ablution.\nThe Virtues of Ablution\nBy the ultimate grace of Allah,\nHe commands us with certain obligations, and then also rewards us for their\nfulfillment. Performing ablution as well has many virtues associated with it,\nfrom forgiveness of sins to it being a mark of recognition on the Day of Judgment.\nThe following are an example of some of the\nahadith\nwhich mention these\nrewards.\n(1)  Messenger of Allah,\nmay the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“When a Muslim or a\nbeliever performs ablution and washes his face, every lesser sin that he\ncommitted as a result of looking washes away with water (or with the last drop\nof water). When he washes his hands, every sin that his hands committed washes\naway with water (or with the last drop of water). When he washes his feet,\nevery sin to which he proceeded washes away with water (or with the last drop\nof water) until he emerges pure and sin free..” (\nMuslim\n)\n(2)  Messenger of Allah said:\n“Shall I inform you (of an\nact) by which Allah erases sins and raises degrees?  They (his Companions) said,\n‘Certainly, O Messenger of Allah.’  He said, ‘Perfecting the ablution under\ndifficult circumstances, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for the\n(next) prayer after the (last) prayer has been performed.  That is\nribat\n[1]\n.’” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\n(3)  Messenger of Allah\npassed by a grave site and said:\n“Peace be upon you, the\nabode of the believing people, and soon we as well, if Allah so wills, are\nabout to join you. I love to see my brothers.”\nThey (his Companions)\nsaid: “Aren’t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah?”\nHe said: “You are my\nCompanions; our brothers are those who have not yet come into the world.”\nThey said: “O Messenger of\nAllah, how would you recognize those persons of your nation [on the Day of\nJudgment] who have not yet been born?”\nHe replied: “Suppose a man\nhad horses with white blazes on their foreheads and legs among other horses\nwhich were all black. Tell me, would he not recognize his own horses?”\nThey said: “Certainly, O\nMessenger of Allah.”\nHe said: “They [those who\nhave not come yet] will come with white faces, arms and legs owing to ablution,\nand I will arrive at the Cistern\n[2]\nbefore them. Some people will be driven away from my Cistern as a\nstray camel is driven away. I will call out: ‘Come, come.’ Then it will be said\n(to me): ‘These people changed [the religion by innovating in it] after you,’\nand I will say: ‘Be off, be off.’” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nOn the Day of Judgment, the\nMuslim nation will be distinguished from other nations by the body parts which\nthey washed for ablution which will be emanating with light:\n“My people will be called\nto presence on the Day of Judgment with bright faces, arms and legs from the\ntraces of ablution.” (\nal-Bukhari\n)\nThe Method of Performing Ablution\nAllah, the Exalted, says\nin the Quran:\n“O you who believe! When\nyou intend to offer the prayer, wash your faces and from your hands up to the\nelbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.” (Quran 5:6)\nProphet Muhammad also said:\n“Allah does not accept any\nprayer performed without being in a state of purity.”\n(Muslim)\nThe Prophet practically taught\nus how to perform ablution, as he was sent to explain the revelation of the\nQuran. The following is a step by step guide explaining what exactly is to be\nwashed and how, gathered from various texts of\nhadith\n.\n(1)  You must have the\nintention of purifying yourself from a state of ritual impurity\n[3]\n.  This means that you\nshould bring into your mind that you are performing this\nwudoo\nin order\nto enter a state of ritual purity. This intention is in the heart and is\nnot\nto be\nuttered.\n(2)  Begin with the name\nof Allah, by saying ‘\nBismillaah\n’.\n(3)  Then, wash your hands\nthree times each. You should always start with the right whenever washing the\nbody parts..\n(4)  Rinse your mouth\nthree times, swirling the water around inside your mouth (gargling), and then rinse\nyour nose three times by inhaling some water into your nostrils and blowing the\nwater out. Use your left hand to remove the water from your nose.\n(5)  Wash your face three\ntimes, from the hairline to the jawbone and chin, and from ear to ear.  A man\nshould wet the hair of his beard because it is part of the face.  If his beard\nis thin he has to wash it inside and out, and if it is thick and covers the\nskin, it is sufficient to wash the surface and run his wet fingers through it.\n("

If\none breaks his\nwudoo\nafter performing\nghusl\n, it is sufficient to\nmake new\nwudoo\nwithout bathing again.\n(2)      For the Bi-Annual Eid prayers.\nA Muslim is encouraged to perform\nghusl\nfor\nEid\nprayers.  Many reports from the Companions have been reported regarding\nthis matter.\n(3)      On entering Mecca.\nIt is preferable for whoever wants to enter Mecca to perform\nghusl\n.\n[2]\n(4)\nGhusl\nafter washing a corpse.\nPerforming\nghusl\nis preferred for one who\nhas washed a corpse.\n[3]\nGhusl\nfor Women\nA woman bathes as outlined above, except that if\nshe has braided hair she does not have to undo it, provided the water can reach\nthe roots of her hair.\n[4]\nIt\nis sufficient for her to pour water over her head three times, making sure that\nthe water completely reaches the roots of her hair.\nAlso, nail polish or any other agent which prevents\nwater from reaching the body parts must be removed at the time of\nghusl\n.\n[5]\nIt is preferable for a woman, after performing\nghusl\ndue to menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding, to take some cotton smeared\nwith fragrance and wipe her private parts, in order to cleanse herself from the\nodor of the menstrual blood.\n[6]\nGhusl\nis not required in the following\ntwo cases:\n(i)   Normal vaginal discharge.  It is\nnormal for a vagina to be naturally moist with a kind of mucus.  It changes\nthroughout the monthly cycle in response to the body’s hormone production.  Most\nnormal young and older women have a white, sticky discharge called leucorrhea,\na liquid quite distinct from orgasmic fluid.  It’s normal for women to get a\nlittle discharge on their clothing.  The secretions can be more inclined to\nwetness or dryness, and be more or less thick or viscous.  These secretions may\nturn white or yellow when exposed to the air.  Normal vaginal fluids can have a\nmild scent, or no aroma at all, and can be clear or milky white when moist,\nyellowish in color when dried, and mucus-like or stringy in consistency.  They\ncan be heavier during mid-cycle, when ovulation occurs, during pregnancy, and\nwhen using birth control pills.\nGhusl\nis not required in such cases.\n(ii)  Foreplay, thinking about intercourse\nand sexual arousal causes veins to dilate.  This swelling creates a “sweating\nreaction,” producing a fluid that lubricates the vagina and wets the entrance. \nThe combination of vaginal mucus and lubrication makes up women’s sexual\nsecretions.  It can be white and thin and is\nnot\nfollowed by feeling of\nexhaustion.  This fluid is called\nmadhiy\nin Arabic.\nGhusl\nis not\nrequired in this case as well.\nA woman is considered sexually impure and must\nperform\nghusl\nin two cases:\n(a)  Insertion of the penis in the vagina,\neven if there is no ejaculation, renders both husband and wife sexually impure. \nBoth require\nghusl\nto resume worship.\n(b)  Emission of the vaginal fluid called\nmaniy\ndue to wet-dream\n[7]\nand\nfemale orgasm.\nA woman has to do\nghusl\nif she\nexperiences an erotic dream and notices\nmoisture\nwhen she wakes up.\nAlso,\nghusl\nbecomes obligatory when\nmaniy\nis produced after female orgasm due to any other reason for that matter.  Orgasm\nis the climax of sexual activity accompanied by vaginal contractions and other\nchanges in the body, and commonly results from sexual intercourse.\n[8]\nCertain indicators like smell and color\ndistinguish\nmaniy\nfrom normal vaginal discharge.  Women’s\nmaniy\n,\nthe fluid which requires\nghusl\n, is known by several qualities:\n(a)  it is released as a result of feeling\nsexual pleasure and a woman feels excitement when it is produced.\n(b)  it is followed by a feeling of\nexhaustion.\n(c)  it has a particular odor.\n[9]\n(d)  it is usually yellow and non-viscous.

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To learn ten etiquettes and duties on\nFriday.\nArabic Terms:\n·Salat\nul-Jumuah\n- Friday Prayer.\n·\nDhuhr\n- the afternoon prayer.\n·\nKhutbah\n- sermon.\n·\nRakah\n- unit of prayer.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling Muslims to the five\nobligatory prayers.\nEtiquette and Duties on Friday\n1.       Wear Clean Clothes & Smell Good\nProphet Muhammad said,\n“Every Muslim should have a ritual bath on Friday and wear his best clothing,\nand if he has perfume, he should use it”\n[1]\n2.       Send Blessings on the Prophet\nIt is highly recommended to send peace and blessings on\nProphet Muhammad on Fridays as the Prophet said,\n“Invoke blessings on me,\nmany times over, on Friday and the night (preceding it); for whoever does so, I\nwill be a witness and intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.”\n[2]\nThis is done by simply saying and repeating the words,\n“\nAllahumma\nsal-ly wa sal-lim ‘Ala Muhammad\n.”\nRepeating these simple words anytime\nduring Friday brings great blessings as mentioned in the above report form\nProphet Muhammad.\n3.       Increase Supplication\nA Muslim should increase his supplication to Allah on\nFriday because there is a time on Friday when Allah responds and gives whatever\ngood He is asked for. The Prophet said,\n“There is an hour on Friday in which\nno Muslim asks during it except that Allah grants him whatever he asks for.”\n[3]\nOne can supplicate in any language he wants. The\netiquettes of supplication have been covered in previous lessons.\n4.       Arrive Early at the Mosque\nProphet Muhammad said,\n“Whoever takes a bath on\nFriday like the one taken to purify oneself from sexual impurity, then he\nleaves at the earliest time, then he is like the one who offers a camel; the\none who comes after that is like one who offers a cow; the one who comes after\nthat is like one who offers a horned ram; the one who comes after that is like\none who offers a chicken; the one who comes after that is like one who offers\nan egg. When the\nImam\narrives, the angels are present to listen to the\nremembrance (meaning the\nkhutbah\n).”\n[4]\nIf a person comes late, he should not step over people\nalready sitting in rows, nor separate two people sitting together. He should\nalso not move another person and take their place. A Muslim should not walk\ndirectly in front of a person praying.\n5.       Sit Close to the\nImam\nA person must try to arrive early and sit close to the\nImam\ndelivering the sermon. Sitting closer to the\nImam\nis better than sitting\nbehind in the back rows or reclining next to a wall. If a new Muslim finds it\nhard to sit on the floor for half an hour or so, he may sit where ever he feels\ncomfortable, but he should try to get accustomed to sitting closer to the\nImam\n.\n6.       Don’t Talk During the\nKhutbah\nAlso, a Muslim should pay attention to the sermon and\nnot talk during it, even if it is delivered in Arabic. Talking during the\nFriday prayer is a serious matter. Prophet Muhammad said,\n“If you say to\nyour friend, ‘Be quiet,’ on Friday when the\nImam\nis delivering the\nsermon, then you have uttered non-sense.”\n[5]\nIn another narration, the Prophet said,\n“…whoever\nutters nonsense is considered as if he has not attended the Friday prayer!”\n[6]\n7.       Pray Two\nRakahs\nFor Entering the Mosque\nBefore Sitting Down\nIf you arrive to the mosque early, you should pray two\nrakahs\nbefore sitting down. If you arrive while the\nImam\nis delivering the\nsermon, you should still pray them, but make it short. The Prophet said,\n“If\nanyone of you enters the mosque on Friday while the\nImam\nis delivering\nthe\nkhutbah\n, let him perform two\nrakahs\nand be brief in doing\nso.”\n[7]\n8.       Don’t Buy or Sell Once the\nAdhan\nHas Been\nCalled\nThis prohibition is based on the Quran itself,\n“... when the\nAdhan\nis proclaimed for the prayer on\nFriday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trading aside...” (Quran 62:9)\n9.    The Friday prayer which consists of two\nrakahs\nis performed after the sermon behind an\nImam\n. Someone who misses it\nshould pray four\nrakahs\nof regular\nDhuhr\nprayer.\n10.  You can pray two or four\nrakahs\nof\nSunnah\n(recommended) prayer after the Friday prayer.\nMaking Arrangements with the Employer for Time Off for\nSalat\nul-Jumuah\nCountless Muslims take time off from their businesses,\nschools, and employers to attend the Friday prayer. Friday prayer is a\nreligious obligation and a new Muslim should make arrangements with their\nschool or employer to take time off for attending it. You can make up the lost\nhours by working extra during the week or staying late on Friday.\n[8]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n[2]\nBaihaqi\n[3]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[4]\nMuwatta\n[5]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[6]\nAbu\nDawood\n[7]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[8]\nContact the following organizations for more information or help:\n(www.cair.com)\n(www.caircan.ca)\n(www.amcran.org)\nIf your country is not listed, you can contact a\nMuslim civil rights organization in your country for help and guidance."

It is basically washing of one's face, hands and arms,\nthen wiping the head and ears, and finally washing the feet.\nWhen Should I Perform Ablution (\nWudoo\n)?\nA Muslim must perform ablution before he performs\nthe prayer (\nsalah\n) if he enters a state of ritual impurity, namely due\nto one of the following causes:\n(1)  Breaking wind.\n(2)  Urination.\n(3)  Defecation (passing feces).\n(4)  Deep sleep.\nThese things are considered to ‘invalidate’ or\n‘break’ ablution (\nwudoo\n).  For example, you must perform ablution after waking\nup in the morning to pray your morning prayer (\nsalah\n), because sleeping\n“breaks” the  ablution. After using the toilet, you have to perform  ablution before\nyou can perform prayer because urinating and defecating “break” the  ablution.\nHow to Perform Ablution?\nBefore you perform ablution, you should make\nsure your body parts are not soiled with impurities. Make sure you have wiped\noff all traces of urine or feces with toilet paper or water after having used\nthe toilet.\nAblution is done in the following order:\n1.    Intend in your heart that you are\nperforming  ablution in order to enter a state of purity for\nsalah\n.\n2.    Begin with the name of Allah by\nsaying,\n‘Bismillaah’\nwhich means,\n‘I begin with\nthe Name of Allah.’\n3.    Rinse the mouth. This can be done\n  once, twice or thrice. See Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n4.    Clean the nostrils by sniffing\n  water and blowing it. This can be done once, twice or thrice. See Figure 2.\nFigure 2\n5.    Wash the face from the hairline to\n  the chin and jawbone, from ear to ear. This can be done once, twice or\n  thrice. See Figure 3.\nFigure 3\n6.    Wash the hands and arms up to and\n  including the elbows. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the\n  right hand.  See Figure 4.\nFigure 4\n7.    After wetting the hands again, wipe\n  the entire head by putting the hands at the front of your head and take them\n  to the back of the head, then bring them back to the place where you\n  started.  This is to be done only once. See Figure 5.\nFigure 5\n8.    Wipe the inner part of the ears\n  with the index fingers and the back of the ears with the thumbs. This is to\n  be done only once. See Figure 6.\nFigure 6\n9.    Wash the feet up to and including\n  the ankles. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the right\n  foot. See Figure 7.\nFigure 7\nWhat is Ritual Bath (\nGhusl\n)?\nGhusl\nis the Arabic word for a complete\nbath. In certain cases, it is not enough to perform ablution before prayers.  One\nneeds to purify themselves by taking a full bath, that is doing the ritual bath\n(\nghusl\n), before they may pray.  You are required to do the ritual bath\nin the following cases:\n1.\nThe emission of semen or female orgasmic\nfluid, whether due to sexual intercourse, wet dreams or masturbation.\n2.\nAfter sexual intercourse.  More\nprecisely, a bath has to be taken if the penis enters the vagina, regardless of\nwhether fluid was emitted or not.\n3.\nMenstruation and post-natal bleeding\n[1]\n.\n4.\nIt is also preferred to perform theritual\nbath upon entering Islam.\nA female cannot offer\nsalah\n(prayer) when\nshe is experiencing menstruation or postpartum bleeding.  After her bleeding\nends, she must purify herself by taking the ritual bath, and then she may resume\nsalah\n(prayer).\nHow to Perform the Ritual Bath\n(1) Intend in your heart to purify yourself\nfor Allah’s sake.\n(2) Wash off any impurity that may be on\nthe body.\n(3) Wash the entire body with water leaving\nno part dry.\n(4) Rinse the mouth and nose.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nPost-natal or post partum bleeding is that bleeding which occurs\nafter childbirth or miscarriage."

And this is why you need to find the prayer timings for your specific\ncity.\nThe prayers do not need to be prayed exactly\nwhen the time starts; rather, they can be prayed at any time before the next\nprayer time starts, with the exception of\nFajr\nand\nIsha.\nThe\nFajr\nprayer should be prayed before sunrise. For this reason, you will find the\ntime for sunrise listed on Prayer schedules, and this does not mean that there\nis a special prayer for Sunrise.  And the\nIsha\nprayer should be prayed\ntill the middle of the night. However, due to necessity, the\nIsha\nprayer\ncan be prayed up to the beginning of\nFajr\ntime.\nThe direction\n: You can use the same\nwebsite to find the direction of prayers. The website will display the bearing\non a compass after you have entered your city.\nThe dress\n: A Muslim man should wear\nsomething that at least covers him from the navel to the knees. A Muslim woman\nmust wear loose clothing that covers her entire body and hair leaving her face\nand palms open.\nState of Purity\n: One should be in a state\nof purity, by performing ablution (\nwudoo’\n) or ritual bath (\nghusl\n)\n[this was covered in Part 1]. Also one should make sure that there is no\nimpurity (such as urine or faeces) on one’s clothes or body. The prayers can be\ndone on any clean surface such as the floor, carpet or a rug. Dust, mud or\ngrease are considered ok and do not affect the prayers.\nThe Prayer (\nSalah\n)\nThe Prayer(\nsalah\n) is to be said\nin Arabic and requires some memorization, so, it usually takes a little time to\nlearn correctly and fully and get used to it.  Not knowing Arabic should not discourage\nyou; just pray the prayer (\nsalah\n) to the best of your ability.\nA new Muslim has to realize that the orders of\nAllah are to be followed within the limit of his or her ability and endurance. \nIf you find it difficult to memorize all of what is necessary for the prayers,\nit may be a good idea in the meantime to write it on a piece of paper and read\nthem in prayer.  If you are unable to do even this, it is sufficient that you\nsay any or all of the following instead:\n·\nSubhanallah\n‘How Perfect is Allah!’\n·\nAl-hamdu lil-lah\n‘All\npraise and thanks are for Allah’\n·\nLa ilaha il-lal-lah\n‘There is no god except Allah’\n·\nAllahu Akbar\n‘Allah\nis the Greatest’\nHere is an example of a\n2 unit prayer (like the\nFajr\nprayer), based on the last method of\nprayers explained above.\n1.  Stand\nstraight facing the direction of prayer.\n2.  Raise\n  your hands up to the shoulders and say\nAllahu Akbar\n.\n  See Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n3.  Then\n  place your right arm over your left arm and place both of them on the chest.\n  In the standing position, say\nSubhanallah\n.\n  See Figure 2.\nFigure 2\n4.  Then\n  say\nAllahu Akbar\nand go to the\n  bowing position. See Figure 3. In the bowing position say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 3\n5.  Then\n  get up from the bowing position to stand straight again. Say\nAllahu Akbar\nwhile getting up.\n  See Figure 4. Here say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 4\n6.  Then\n  go to the position of prostration. See Figure 5. Say\nAllahu Akbar\nwhile going down.\n  In the position of prostration say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 5\n7.  Then\n  come to the sitting position as in Figure 6. While sitting up, say\nAllahu Akbar\n.

Before making\ntayammum\n, you should try to get appropriate\nwater from any accessible place you can find it.  Only if you cannot find good water,\nor it is too far away, can you make\ntayammum\n.\n‘Imran bin Husain, one of the companions of Prophet\nMuhammad said,\n“We were with the Messenger of Allah during a journey.  When\nhe led the people in prayer, one man stayed apart.  He asked him, “What\nprevented you from praying?”  He said, ‘I need a purifying bath and there is not\nsufficient water.’  He said, ‘Use the soil, for it is sufficient.’’’\n[3]\n(2)  Injury or illness.\nYou may perform\ntayammum\nif you think using water\nwill worsen your disease based on past experience or the doctor’s advice. A\nperson hospitalized who is unable to make\nwudoo\n, may keep a bag with\nsome clean soil to make\ntayammum\n.\n(3)  If the water is harmful to you because it is too\ncold and for some reason you cannot heat it up.\n‘Amr ibn al-’Aas narrated that he was participating in\nan expedition.  He had a wet dream during an extremely cold night, and was\nafraid that if he performed\nghusl\nhe would die.  He prayed the morning\nprayer with his companions.  He then went to the Messenger of Allah to ask him\nabout this.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsaid,\n“O ‘Amr, did you pray with your companions while you needed a purifying\nbath?”\n‘Amr mentioned the verse,\n“Do not kill yourselves, Allah is\nmerciful to you”\nto the Prophet.  The Prophet just smiled and didn’t say\nanything.\n[4]\n(4)  If the water is nearby, but you cannot reach\nit due to fear.\n(5)  If you have water, but you need it for\ncooking, or are saving it for use later.  For example, this may arise while\ncamping.  Many of the companions would save their drinking water and performed\ntayammum\n.\n(6)  If you fear the time for\nsalah\n(ritual\nprayer) will be over by the time you get to water.\nHow to Perform\nTayammum\n1.    You must have the intention of purifying yourself\nand removing impurity.  The intention is in the heart and is not uttered.\n2.    Say ‘\nBismillah\n’ (I begin with the name\nof Allah).\n3.    Gently touch the ground or a dusty surface\nwith the palms of both hands.\n4.    Blow on the hands and shake off any access,\nso as not to make the face dusty.\n5.    Wipe the palms together, then the face, and then\nthe palms and backs of the hands up to the wrists.\nAmmar, Prophet’s companion, said, “We became sexually\nimpure and had no water, so we rolled in the dirt as does an animal and prayed.” \nThis was mentioned to the Prophet and he said:\n“This would"

More\nspecifically, in Islam it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the\nmost important form of worship.\n·\nTakbiratul-Ihram – saying ‘Allahu Akbar’\nthat commences the prayer.\n·\nTashahhud\n- the saying “\nAt-tahiy-yatu\nlil-lahi….

The two\nsajdahs\nmade\nat the end of\nsalah\nto make up for major errors are known as the\n‘prostration of forgetfulness’ or\nsajdah as-sahw\nin Arabic.\nImportance\nWe human beings are forgetful by nature and even forget\nwhen we are praying to Allah. Our Creator is well aware of that fact and He\nmade His Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, forget on\nsome occasions in the prayer. This way the Prophet showed us how to correct our\nmistakes in the prayer. Making up for our mistakes in prayer is a great mercy\nfrom Allah because He could have made us repeat the prayer for every mistake,\nbut He did not.\nWhen Are Prostrations of Forgetfulness Required?\nThey are two occasions when they\nare required:\nI.When\nyou add or subtract to the acts of\nsalah\n.\nExamples of addition:\nYou pray 5\nrakahs\ninstead of 4.\nYou do three\nprostrations instead of two.\nYou make\ntashahhud\nat the end of first\nrakah.\nExample of subtraction:\nYou pray 3\nrakahs\ninstead of 4.\nYou do one\nsajdah\ninstead of two.\nYou get up for the third\nrakah\nwithout doing the first\ntashahhud.\nII.When\nyou forget the number of\nrakahs\nand are in doubt, (for example) whether\nyou prayed three of four\nrakahs\n.\nMissing a\nRukn\n(Essential Component or Pillar of\nSalah\n)\nIf you omit the\nTakbiratul-Ihram\n, then there is\nno prayer for you, regardless of whether you left it intentionally or due to\nforgetfulness, because you never started the prayer.\nIf you omit a\nrukn\nother than the\nTakbiratul-Ihram\ndeliberately, your\nsalah\nis invalid.\nIf you left a\nrukn\nout of forgetfulness and you\nreached the next\nrakah\n, then the\nrakah\nin which you left the\nrukn\nis invalid and the following\nrakah\ntakes its place.\nIf you did not reach the next\nrakah\n, you must\nreturn to the\nrukn\nyou omitted and perform it and follow it by what\ncomes after it in the course of the\nsalah\n.\nIn both of the above situations, you offer the “prostration\nof forgetfulness”.\nMissing a\nWajib\n(Obligatory act of\nsalah\n)\nIf you leave out something\nwajib\nunintentionally,\nlike the first\ntashahhud\nor a prostration, you simply do\nsajdah\nas-sahw\nat the conclusion of prayer.  However, it is left intentionally,\nthen the prayer is invalid.\nMissing a Recommended Act in Prayer\nYou do not have to make the “prostration of\nforgetfulness” if you forget to perform one of the recommended acts of prayer.\nMethod of\nSajdah as-sahw\nYou have a choice between two\nways of doing it:\n1.    Immediately\nbefore\ntasleem\nat\nthe end of\nsalah.\nBefore concluding the prayer with\ntasleem\n, you\nsay\nAllahu Akbar\n, and then make the first prostration.\nIn the prostration you say,\nSubha-na Rabbi al-A\n'la\nthree times. Then you say\nAllahu Akbar\nand return to the sitting\nposition.\nThen you say\nAllahu Akbar\nagain and make the\nsecond prostration and say the same words as you did in the first prostration.\nYou then say\nAllahu Akbar\nfor the last time,\nreturn to the sitting position, and turn your head to the right and then to the\nleft, saying each time “\nAs-Salamu\n'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah\n.”\n2.    Doing it\nafter\ntasleem.\nAnother way is to continue your\nsalah\nand end it\nwith\ntasleem\nas you normally would.\nAfter that you say\nAllahu Akbar\nand prostrate for\nyour first prostration, and say\nSubha-na Rabbi al-A\n'la\nthree\ntimes. Then you say\nAllahu Akbar\nand return to the sitting position.\nThen you say\nAllahu Akbar\nagain and do your\nsecond prostration and say\nSubha-na Rabbi al-A\n'la\nthree times.\nFinally, you say\nAllahu Akbar\nthe last time and\nreturn to the sitting position, and then turn your face to the right saying “\nAs-Salamu\n'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah\n.”\nFurther Notes/Examples\n1.    If you realize before making\ntasleem\nthat you have added anything to the\nsalah\n, for example an extra\nrakah\n,\nyou may do\nsajdah as-sahw\nbefore or after\ntasleem\n.\n2.    If you did not pray one or more\nrakah\n,\nyou"

faces\nduring the formal prayers.\n·\nWudoo\n– ablution.\n·\nSalam\n- The Islamic greeting such as '\nAs-Salamu\nAlaikum\n'.\nSomething as mundane as\nrelieving oneself is tied to a Muslim’s sense of cleanliness and modesty.  There\nis nothing odd or strange about it, as Islam literally is all encompassing,\nsomething that evokes a pleasant surprise in some people.  Even in the time of\nthe Prophet, there was a polytheist who exclaimed with astonishment to Salman,\nthe Persian, “Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to\ndefecate\n!”\n Salman responded, ‘“Yes, he forbade us to face the direction of Mecca\nwhen urinating or defecating…”\n[1]\nIn this lesson we will detail the\nmanners of relieving oneself, something apparently minor, but implies much about\npersonal hygiene and religious observance.\n(A)   Supplications before Relieving\nOneself\nThere are certain supplications\none should recite when entering or leaving the place one relieves oneself,\nwhether it be in a bathroom or in nature.\n(a)  One should say “\nBismillah\n”\n(I begin with the Name of Allah) before entering, because the Messenger of\nAllah said:\n“The eyes of the\njinn\nare blocked from seeing the nakedness of the sons of Adam when one of them says\nbefore entering the place for relieving oneself, ‘\nBismillah\n.’” (\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\n(b)\nAllah-humma\ninnee a’oodhu bika min al-khubuthi wa’l-kha-baa’ith\n.\n“O Allah, I seek refuge\nwith You from male and female devils.” (\nAbu Daud\n,\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\nEnter with your left foot.\n(B)   Inside the Toilet\nFacing the\nQibla\nOut of respect a Muslim should\nnot face the\nqiblah\n[2]\nwhen urinating or defecating.  The Messenger of Allah said:\n“When any one of you sits\ndown to answer the call of nature, he should not face the\nqiblah\nor turn\nhis back towards it.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nConcealment\nWe must conceal ourselves from\nthe sight of others when answering the call of nature.  The Messenger of Allah\npreferred to go behind a rise on the ground or a garden of date palms.\n[3]\nIf a person is in the\nopen and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call\nof nature, he should move away from public sight.  One of the Companions\ndescribed how he was with the Prophet on a journey, and when the Prophet felt\nthe need to answer the call of nature, he went far away.\n[4]\nWhen outdoors, one should not\nuncover their private parts until they squat close to the ground, as it is more\nconcealing.\n[5]\nIndoors, first make sure you have closed the door and are out of sight.\n(C)   Relieving Oneself\nSquatting\nOutdoors, it is best to answer\nthe call of nature sitting.  It is better to adopt a posture that is more\nconcealing, one which will cause no splash-back on yourself or your clothes.  If\nthere is a need and a person does not fear splash-back, it is permissible to\nurinate standing up.\nSplash-Back\nOne must take great care to avoid\nthe splash-back of urine, both on themselves and their clothes.  If urine or\nstool soils some part of body or clothes, those areas must also be washed, and\nthe impurity must be totally removed from them.  The Messenger of Allah passed\nby two graves, and said:\n“Indeed they are being\npunished, but for something which seemed trivial to them: this one used not to\nguard himself from urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious\ngossip.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nProhibited Places\nIslam forbids urinating in\nplaces where people might pass by, or seek shade therein, such a park, because it\nis something disturbing to people.  The Prophet said, “\nFear the two things\nthat bring curses\n.”  They asked, “What are the two things that bring\ncurses, O Messenger of Allah?”\nHe said:\n“When a person relieves\nhimself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade.” (\nAbu\nDaud\n)\nAlso, it is forbidden to urinate\nin stagnant water, as it was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah.\n[6]\nIt obviously makes the\nwater impure and will disturb those who use it.\nConversation\nDon’t say, ‘\nAs-Salamu Alaikum’\nto a person who is answering the call of nature, or reply with ‘\nWa Alaikum Assalam\n’\nwhile relieving yourself, out of respect for God’s name.\nAl-Salaam\nis one\nof Allah’s beautiful Names.\nA man passed by the Prophet while\nhe was urinating, and greeted him with\nSalam\n.  The Messenger of Allah\nsaid to him:\n“If you see me in this\nstate, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond.” (\nIbn Majah\n)\nIt is disliked to speak while\nrelieving oneself unnecessarily.\nUrinals\nUrinals should be avoided for\nfour reasons.  First, there is no privacy.  Private parts are exposed, which is\nindecent and forbidden.  Second, it is almost impossible to avoid splash-back. \nThird, there is no toilet paper. Fourth, people sometimes talk while urinating,\nan activity better left outside the toilet!\n(D)   Cleaning Method\n(a)      Using the Left Hand\nThe Prophet’s wife H"

 He will even use matters of the\ndeen\nmaking you think\nabout anything other than the prayer.\nEight easy ways for gaining and maintaining\nkhushoo\n.\n1)Prepare for prayer properly.  You can do this\nby repeating the words of the\nadhan\nand making\ndu’a\n.  Paying\nattention to your ablution and all the time remembering Allah\n.\nAlso\nmaking sure that your clothes and place of prayer are clean and tidy.  Allah is\nof course the most deserving of our clean attire and surroundings.\n2)Move calmly to the place of prayer and also during\nthe prayer.  Do not move through the positions of prayer like a chicken pecking\nat the ground.  Haste prevents\nkhushoo\n.\n3)Remember death and what awaits us after death. \nProphet Muhammad said, “Remember death in your prayer, for the man who\nremembers death is bound to pray properly and pray the prayer of a man who does\nnot think that he will prayer any other prayer”.\n[2]\n4)Think about the words of the prayer and the\nrecited verses of the Quran.  The Quran was revealed to be pondered over.  It\nwould be helpful to read a\ntafseer\n.  Pause at the end of each\nayah\nand even interact with the words.  For instance when Prophet Muhammad recited\nan ayah that mentioned glorification he said\nSubhanAllah\n, if the\nayah\nmentioned seeking refugee with Allah he would seek refuge with Allah.\n[3]\n5)Recite in a slow rhythmic tone and try to\nbeautify your voice.  Allah says in Quran,\n“…And recite the Quran in a slow\npleasant style.” (Quran 73:4)\nA slow measured pace is more conducive to\nreflection.\n6)Keep in mind that Allah responds to prayers.  Prayer\nis a connection and con"

Women must understand\nthe rulings pertinent to each type, as they deal with important aspects of\nworship, such as purification, prayer and fasting. This lesson will try to\nexplain the most important rulings relevant to each type of bleeding.\nMenstruation\nMenstruation is the release of blood\nand tissue through the vagina that occurs on a monthly cycle, not due to\nspecific events such as birth or breakage of the hymen.  Menstrual periods\nusually occur once a month and last for several days.  Blood loss due to\nmenstrual flow may vary from month to month.  Women typically use sanitary\nnapkins (pads) or tampons to absorb menstrual flow. Menstrual blood is almost\nalways dark color and not bright.\nPost-Childbirth bleeding\nSuch bleeding\noccurs after the event of birth or miscarriage.  It has no minimum duration,\nbut it may even last up to forty days.  Umm Salamah said:\n“During the lifetime of the\nProphet, the post-childbirth woman would seclude herself for forty days.”\n(al-Bukhari)\nA woman experiencing post-childbirth\nbleeding has to stop praying for forty days unless her bleeding stops before\nthat.  If her bleeding stops before that time, she is to perform\nghusl\n(ritual\nbath) and start praying.  If she sees blood after forty days, most scholars say\nthat she is not to stop praying. The blood of postpartum bleeding is also\nalmost always dark.\nForbidden Acts\nDivine wisdom has exempted women from\ncertain religious duties due to various reasons associated with bleeding.  The\nfollowing is a list of acts which are forbidden during menstruation and post-childbirth\nbleeding:\n(1)      Formal Prayer (\nSalah\n)\nA woman experiencing her period or\npost-childbirth bleeding is not to perform her prayers, whether obligatory or\nvoluntary, and those prayers which are missed due to this reason are not to be\nmade up at a later time.\nIf her blood flow starts after the time\nfor a certain prayer begins, for example, half an hour after the time for\nDhuhr\nprayer, then, after her bleeding ends, she should make up that\nDhuhr\nprayer,\nsince she was pure when the prayer became obligatory upon her. She should not,\nhowever, make up the prayers she missed while she is bleeding.\n[1]\nIf  there is enough time left to pray\nat least one\nrakah\n(unit of prayer) after performing the ritual bath, she\nshould pray that prayer, because the Prophet said:\n“Whoever catches with one unit of\nprayer (\nrakah\n) before the sun rises has caught the\nFajr\nprayer,\nand whoever catches with one\nrakah\nbefore the sun sets has caught the\nAsr\nprayer.” (\nSaheeh al-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nExample: if she performs the ritual\nbath after the completion of her bleeding at the time of\nAsr\nand there\nis enough time left before sunset for her to pray one\nrakah\n, then she\nshould pray\nAsr\n.\n(2)      Fasting\nIt is forbidden for a woman experiencing\nmenstruation or postpartum bleeding to fast, whether it be for\nRamadan\nor\nvoluntarily, but unlike the formal prayers she must make up the missed days of\nRamadan\n.\n(3)      Sexual intercourse\nIt is forbidden to have sexual\nintercourse while a women is menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding,\nalthough other types of intimacy are allowed.  As for anal intercourse, it is\nforbidden at all times.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, was asked “What is it permissible for me to do with my wife when she\nis menstruating?”  He said:\n“Do as you wish except for sexual\nintercourse.”\n(Muslim)\n(4)     Touching a copy of the Quran\nIt is forbidden to touch a copy of the Quran\nwhen one is in any state of impurity, because Allah says:\n“… which none can touch except the purified.”\n(Quran 56:79)\nThe Prophet told the people of Yemen:\n“No one should touch the Quran\nexcept one who is pure.” (\nMalik\n,\nan-Nasa’i\n,\nIbn Hibbaan\n,\nal-Bayhaqi\n)\nPermissible Acts\n(1)  reciting the Quran from\nmemory.\n(2)\nDu’a\n(supplication).\n(3)  engaging in\nadhkar\n: remembering\nAllah with specific words like\nSubhan-Allah\n,\nAllahu Akbar\n, and\nothers.\n(4)  reading books of hadeeth or\nany other Islamic books.\nOne should keep in mind that it is\npermissible to read and touch a translation of the Quran, as it is not the word\nof Allah but rather a"

Should I apply for\nthis\nhalal\njob or another? One shouldprays\nIstikharah\nconcerning\nthe thing he or she thinks is more likely to be better and then go ahead with\ndoing it.\nIstikharah\nis not prayed for matters that are\nconsidered obligatory acts of worship, or for staying away from sins and evil\nactions.\nIt is recommended, before praying\nIstikharah\n, to\nconsult someone whom you know is sincere, caring and has experience, and who is\ntrustworthy with regard to his or her religious commitment and knowledge.\nCommon Mistakes\n·\nBelieving that there is a set number of\ntimes to pray\nIstikharah\n.\nThere is no set time period for praying\nIstikharah\nand it is permissible to repeat it more than once.\n·\nBelieving in the need for a dream.\nSome people believe that after praying\nIstikharah\nthey should experience a dream or feeling of ease.  This is not correct.   Even\nwithout such a thing, if a person makes a decision it should be hoped, due to\nthe sincere\ndu’a\nof\nIstikharah\n, that this will be the best decision.\n·\nBelieving that the\ndu’a\nwas not\nanswered.\nIf a person does not succeed in a decision he takes\nafter praying\nIst"

For example, while it is fine to pray to Allah to marry someone, it\nis forbidden to ask Allah to give you a girl friend or a boy friend, or to win\na lottery.\n2.Not expecting an answer\nA Muslim should hope that Allah will answer His\ndu’a\nas Allah is Merciful to His slaves and powerful to grant them their wishes.\n3.To ask for things of this world only in\ndu’a\nThink about it, what is greater, this world or the\nhereafter? For a true believer, it is obvious that what Allah has prepared in\nthe life to come is greater. Therefore, a Muslim who understands this point\nwill ask Allah for the blessings of the Hereafter as well.\n4.To address Allah with improper Names\nRemember this simple rule: do not address Allah or use\nany Name of Allah that is not from the Quran or\nSunnah\n. Addressing Allah\nwith words like “Big Guy.”\n5.Do not make\ndu’a\nagainst yourself or your family and do\nnot curse others.\nA point to remember, as a person may pray against a\nfamily member or even himself in a fit of rage and start cursing.\n6.Do not pray for your death\nYour life is Allah’s gift to you, do not ask Allah to\ntake it away!\nPreferred Times When\nDu’a\nIs Likely to Be Accepted\nDu’a\ncan be made at any time, but it is more\nlikely to be accepted at the following times:\n1.\nDu’a\nin the last third of the night\nAllah informs us in the Quran describing the believers,\n“and they seek forgiveness from their Lord in the hours of the\ndawn.” (Quran 51:18)\nHow do you calculate the last third of the night? The\nnight extends from the time of sunset till the time for Fajr begins. For\nexample, say sunset is at 5pm and Fajr for next day starts at 5am. The night is\n12 hrs. A third of a night is 4 hrs. The last third of the night will be from\n1am-5am.\n2.\nDu’a\nwhen\nAdhan\nis called\nThe Prophet said, “\nWhen the\nAdhan\nis called,\nthe doors of the skies are opened, and the\ndu’a\nis answered.\n” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\n3.\nDu’a\nBetween\nAdhan\n&\nIqama\nThis is one of the best times for the prayer to be\naccepted that is given to a believer to ask from Allah for his needs of this\nworld and the Hereafter.\n4.\nDu’a\nwhile prostrating (kowtowing)\nThis is the best posture that a worshipper can be in\nbecause it is the height of humility. Allah loves this posture the most. The\nProphet, may Allah praise him, said: “\nThe closest that a person is to his\nLord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of\ndu’a\nthen.\n” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\n5.\nDu’a\nbefore the conclusion of formal prayer\nBefore concluding the formal prayers, by saying\n‘As-Salamu\n‘Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah’\na person can make any\ndu’a\nthat he likes at\nthis time as it is one of the times when prayers are responded to.\n6.\nDu’a\nafter the obligatory formal prayer\nWhen asked which\ndu’a\nis most likely to be\nresponded to, the Prophet said, “\nIn the last part of the night and after the\nobligatory prayers.\n” (\nTirmidhi\n)\n7.An hour on Friday\nProphet Muhammad said: “\nOn Friday there is an hour\nwhen, if a Muslims happens to pray at that time and ask Allah for something\ngood, He will give it to him\n” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\n8.\nDu’a\nin Ramadan, the month of fasting\nProphet Muhammad said: “\nWhen Ramadan comes, the doors\nof mercy are opened and the doors of Hell are closed, and the devils are locked\nup.\n” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\n9.First ten days of the Islamic month of Hajj (\nDhul-Hijjah\n)\nThe Islamic month in which the annual pilgrimage, or\nHajj, is performed, is a blessed month. The Prophet said about the first ten\ndays of this month,\n“There are no days during which good deeds are more\nbeloved to Allah than during these ten days.”\n(\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\n10.During rainfall\nThe Prophet said,\n“Two are the\ndu’as\nthat are\nnever returned: the\ndu’a\nmade when the\nAdhan\nis called and at the\ntime of rainfall.”\n(\nAbu Daud\n)"

Like socks, you may not wipe\nover the shoes if you remove them after having broken your\nwudoo\n,\nrather, in this case, you will have to make\nmasah\nover the socks\nunderneath them.\nMaking up Missed Prayers\nMaking up prayers missed intentionally or\nunintentionally is called\nqada’\nin Arabic.  We will only discuss making\nup the\nsalah\nif you missed it unintentionally.  A person who misses a\nsalah\nis responsible for performing it no matter how late he remembers it.  The\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“If anyone misses a\nsalah\n, he must pray it\nwhen he remembers it.  There is no expiation except the\nsalah\nitself.”\n[1]\nFor example, if you remember at the time of\nAsr\nthat you have missed\nDhuhr\n, you should make up\nDhuhr\nand then\npray\nAsr\n.\nMethod\nIf you sleep through a\nsalah\n, meaning the time\nfor that prayer has passed and you have slept through it, you must make\nwudoo\nupon waking up and offer it.  One night, during a journey with the Prophet,\nsome people said, ‘If only the Prophet would take rest with us during the last\nhours of the night.’  He replied,\n‘I am afraid you will sleep and miss the\nFajr\nsalah\n.’\nBilal said, ‘I will wake you up.’  They all went to sleep, but\nBilal also fell asleep!  The Prophet woke up when the sun began to rise and\nsaid,\n‘O Bilal, what happened to your statement?’\nHe replied, ‘I have\nnever slept so much!’  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, said,\n‘Allah took our souls when He wished and released them when\nHe wished.  O Bilal, get up and call the\nAdhan\nfor prayer.’\nThe\nProphet then made\nwudoo\nand when the sun came up completely, he stood up\nand prayed.\n[2]\nPrayer of the Traveler\nIslamic law makes the\nsalah\neasier for a traveler\nin two ways:\nBy shortening prayers: the four\nrakah\nsalah\nis shortened to two\nrakahs\n.\nBy combining prayers:\nDhuhr\ncan be combined with\nAsr\n,\nMaghrib\ncan be combined with\nIsha\n.  Prayers, however, cannot be\ncombined in any other way.\nFajr\ncannot be combined with\nIsha\n,\nFajr\ncannot be combined with\nDhuhr\n.\nAsr\ncan not be combined with\nMaghrib\n.\nConditions\nPrayers can be shortened when one is traveling.  You cannot\nshorten the prayers unless you have actually left your city limits.  There is\nno time limit as to how long you can shorten the prayers.  The majority of\nscholars allow it for up to four days and nights, though.  In case of bad weather,\nprayers can be co"

possess for\nzakah\nto become obligatory.\nThe five most important and essential acts of worship in Islam\nare simply known as the “pillars of Islam.”  They are the “\nshahadah\n”\n(the testimony that no one deserves worship except Allah and Muhammad is the\nMessenger of Allah), the five daily prayers,\nzakah\n, fasting, and the\nhajj\npilgrimage.  A Muslim has to first and foremost focus on learning and\npracticing these pillars before focusing on other aspects of Islam.\nThe word ‘\nzakah\n’ is usually translated as ‘poor\ndue’ or ‘alms tax.’  Actually, no single word can translate\nzakah\nproperly.\nBefore the word\nzakah\nis explained, it is best\nunderstood with another word, “\nsadaqah\n.”\nZakah\nand\nsadaqah\nare different.\nZakah\nis obligatory charity and is required, whereas\nsadaqah\nis voluntary\ncharity and is a recommended act that brings extra reward.  Moreover,\nzakah\nis the third pillar of Islam.  Not paying\nzakah\nout of negligence is a\nsin, whereas a person is generally not sinful for not paying voluntary charity. \nThat is why it is called “voluntary” charity!\nZakah\nis calculated\nprecisely and can only be given to specific recipients, whereas\nsadaqah\nis not bound by such regulations.\nZakah\nhas to be given yearly, whereas\nsadaqah\ncan be given only once or as frequently as one likes.\nSpirituality of\nZakah\nZakah\nis a beautiful act of worship that is\nintimately tied to purification.  As a matter of fact, spending one’s wealth in\nzakah\npurifies the heart from the love of material wealth.  A person who\noffers the gift of his wealth affirms the truth that to him nothing is dearer\nthan the love of Allah and he is prepared to sacrifice even his wealth to\nplease Allah.  The Prophet Muhammad said,\n‘Whoever pays the\nzakah\non his wealth will\nhave its evil removed from him.’\n[1]\nExact Definition of\nZakah\nIn Islamic Law (\nShariah\n), words are clearly\ndefined.\nZakah\nis no exception.\nShariah\ndefines\nzakah\nto\nbe specific portion of one’s wealth that one must give yearly to a specific\ngroup of recipients that are mentioned in the Quran.\nImportance of\nZakah\n& the Punishment for Not\nPaying It\nZakah\nrepresents the compassion of Islam towards\nthe poor and needy.\nZakah\nis not a tax, but it is an act of worship for\nwhich one receives reward from Allah.  Not paying the\nzakah\nis a sin.  Denying\nits obligation is an act of disbelief.\nThe Quran tells us about the fate of those who refuse to\npay\nzakah\n.  It says,\n“…And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it\nin the way of Allah, warn them of a painful suffering (in the life to come).  On\nthat day when (the hoarded wealth) will be heated in the fire of Hell and with\nit their foreheads, their sides, and their backs will be branded (and it will\nbe said to them), ‘This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves, so\ntaste what you used to hoard.’” (Quran 9:34-35)\nWhat is\nNisaab\n?\nZakah\nis not to be paid unless the wealth reaches\na minimum level called “\nnisaab\n.” Think of\nnisaab\nas a scale to\nhelp you determine if you are required to pay\nzakah\n.  Different forms of\nwealth have different\nnisaab\n:\nSilver 595gm\nGold 85gm,\n3 US oz, or 2.74 troy oz of pure gold\nCash\n& Savings      Equal to the value of 85 gm of gold or 595 gm of silver, whichever\nworks out to be less.\nZakah\non above items is 2.5% of their value.  If\nthe\nnisaab\nis met in any one form of wealth,\nzakah\nbecomes\napplicable only on that particular form of wealth and is calculated on the\ntotal (\nnisaab\nplus excess) of that.\nThe prices of gold and silver vary everyday in\ninternational markets.  For example, on August 15, 2012 the price of gold was approximately\n$51.54/gm and for silver was $0.89/gm, hence the\nnisaab\nfor gold was\napproximately $4380.9 ($51.54 x 85 grams) and the\nnisaab\nfor silver was\napproximately $529.55 ($0.89 x 595 grams).  Gold and silver prices can be\nobtained from www.goldprice.org\nWhen is\nZakah\nDue?\nMany Islamic rules and regulations depend on the Islamic\nlunar year.\nZakah\nis one of them.  If you have had wealth more than the\nnisaab\nfor one (lunar) year, then you just pay the\nzakah\n.  Though\nnot\nrequired, but most people calculate their\nzakah\nRamadan to\nRamadan.  You can fix to calculate and pay your\nzakah\nevery 1\nst\nor 15\nth\nof Ramadan.\nExample: Say you have $2000/- and 800 grams of gold f"

401(k), Keogh,\nIRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, etc.  - as zakatable at the rate of 2.5% annually.  Usually\nnot all the money is accessible to the investor for withdrawal, up to 50%\nnormally being allowed.  Therefore, the following formula is suggested by some\nscholars:\nWithdrawal Amount - Prescribed Penalty - Prescribed\nTax = Zakatable Amount\nWho Can Receive\nZakah\n?\nThe Quran tells us who is entitled to receive\nzakah\n. \nThe eight categories are found in the Quran in Chapter at-Tawbah, 9:60:\n1.  The Poor\nPoor people who do not have sufficient money to meet\ntheir needs are qualified to receive\nzakah\n.  It does not mean they are\npenniless, but cannot make their ends meet, yet they do not ask others for help\nout of modesty and a sense of self-respect.\n2.  The Destitute\nThese are people who are so poor that they have nothing\nto meet their needs.  Obviously, they are in worse condition than the first\ncategory.\n3.\nZakah\nAdministrators\nPeople responsible for collecting and distributing\nzakah\ncould be paid for their work from\nzakah\nfunds.  They can receive wages\nwhether they are poor or not.\n4.  Reconcile Hearts\nPeople who have recently accepted Islam can be given\nzakah\n. \nPeople can also be given money from\nzakah\nto seek their support or to\nprevent their opposition.\n5.  Freeing Slaves\nIn the past,\nzakah\nmoney was also used to buy\nslaves their freedom.  The Quran has legislated it to be one of the legitimate ways\nto spend the money from\nzakah\n.  It is a clear expression of the\ncompassion of Islam towards treatment of slaves when they existed.  Islam\nraised freeing slaves to an act of worship pleasing to God.  No other religion\nhas ever done that as far as this author is aware of.\n6.  Paying Debts\nPeople who are overburdened with debt and do not have a\nway to pay on their own can also receive\nzakah\nfunds.  The debt can be\ndue to medical reasons, marriage, or other lawful expenses.\n7.  Cause of Allah\nWealth can also be spent in the cause of Allah.  The\ntraditional understanding held by the classical scholars of Islam is that this\ncategory is reserved for jihad or a legitimate war.  Later scholars have\nincluded efforts for the spread and ideological defense of Islam in this\ncategory as well.\n8.  Travelers\nPeople used to get stranded in the past while traveling\nwith no access to their funds back home.  It happens sometimes today as well.  In\nsuch situations, those travelers may be given money from\nzakah\n.  The\ncondition is that their journey should not be in disobedience of Allah, but for\nan acceptable cause like seeking knowledge, looking for a job, or doing\nbusiness.\nWho Can Not Receive\nZakah\n?\nA wealthy person cannot give\nzakah\nto his or her\nparents because they are the child’s responsibility.  Also, a husband cannot\ngive\nzakah\nto his wife as she is his financial responsibility.  Furthermore,\na non-Muslim cannot be given\nzakah\naccording to the majority of scholars. \nPoor non-Muslims can be helped with\nsadaqah\nor voluntary charity.\nPractical Tips on Giving\nZakah\n1.    You can give money to a poor and needy\nMuslims directly if you know them.\n2.    Your local Islamic center most likely\ncollects\nzakah\nand distributes it to the needy of the local community or\nworks with a charitable organization.  Therefore, you can always ask the local\nmosque if they accept\nzakah\n.  You might even find boxes labeled “\nzakah\n”\nin the mosque in which you can simply drop your check or cash for\nzakah\n.\n3.    Furthermore, you can search online and find\nnumerous Islamic charitable organization that collect\nzakah\nto sponsor\norphans or distribute food or medicine in disaster-struck areas.\nThe following are just some of the organizations you can\ngive your\nzakah\nto:\nwww.zakat.org\nwww.islamic-relief.com\nwww.hhrd.org\nMiscellaneous Issues\nZakah\nis to be paid on gold and silver jewelry.  The\nzakah\non the gold will be calculated according to the gold content in\nthe jewelry (i.e.  karats) and its value in the market.  Hence when calculating\nthe value of your gold, you must consult a jeweler for the correct value (based\non the content and weight).  Any stones in the jewelry are not subject to\nzakah\n.\nYou must have the intention to pay\nzakah\nwhen you\ngive it out.  In other words,"

The Prophet informed us,\n“Fasting the day of\nAshura\nis an expiation\nfor the past year.”\n[3]\n4.       Fasting Mondays and Thursdays\nAbu Hurairah, the close companion of Prophet Muhammad,\nreported that the Prophet would fast on Mondays and Thursdays.  When asked\nabout that, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsaid:\n“The actions are presented on every Monday and Thursday.  Allah\nforgives every Muslim or every believer, except for those who are boycotting\neach other.  He says (about them): ‘Leave them.’”\n[4]\nWhen the Prophet\nwas asked about fasting on Mondays, he said\n: “That is the day on which I\nwas born and the day on which I received revelation.”\n[5]\n5.       Fasting most of the month of Sha’ban (8\nth\nIslamic month)\nSha’ban\nis the name of the Islamic month that\ncomes before\nRamadan\n.  The Prophet would fast most of the month of\nSha’ban\n.\n‘Aisha, the wife\nof the Prophet, said:\n“I never saw the Messenger of Allah fast a\ncomplete month except for\nRamadan\n, and I have never seen him fast more\nin a month than he did in\nSha’ban\n.”\n[6]\nDifferences Between Fasts of\nRamadan\n& Voluntary\nFasts\n1.    The intention for a voluntary fast can be\nmade during the day\nLet us say that you woke up and prayed\nFajr\n.  You\ndid not have the intention to fast that day and you also did not eat, drink,\nhave intercourse, or o"

It has been practiced for centuries in connection with religious\nceremonies by Christians, Jews, Confucians, Hindus, Taoists, Jains, and others\nas Allah says:\n“O you who believe, fasting is\nprescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may\nbecome righteous.” (Quran 2:183)\nBut like other rituals fasting\nwas also altered and corrupted.\nFasting in Primitive Societies\nFasting was made part of the\nfertility rites in primitive ceremonies which were held at the vernal and\nautumnal equinoxes and survived for centuries.  Some primitive societies fasted\nto avert catastrophe or to serve as penance for sin.  Native North Americans\nheld tribal fasts to avert threatening disasters.  The Native Americans of\nMexico and the Incas of Peru observed penitential fasts to appease their gods. Past\nnations of the Old World, such as the Assyrians and the Babylonians, observed\nfasting as a form of penance.\nFasting in Judaism and Christianity\nJews observe fasting as a form\nof penitence and purification annually on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur,\nwhich corresponds to the tenth of Muharram (\n‘Ashura\n) of the Islamic\ncalendar.  On this day neither food nor drink is permitted.\nEarly Christians associated\nfasting with penitence and purification. During the first two centuries of its\nexistence, the Christian Church established fasting as a voluntary preparation\nfor receiving the sacraments of Holy Communion and baptism and for the\nordination of priests. Later, these fasts were made obligatory, as other days\nwere subsequently added.  In the 6th century the Lenten fast was expanded to 40\ndays, on each of which only one meal was permitted.  After the Reformation,\nfasting was retained by most Protestant Churches and was made optional in some\ncases. Stricter Protestants like the Puritans, however, condemned not only the\nfestivals of the Church, but its traditional fasts as well.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, fasting\nmay involve partial abstinence from food and drink or total abstinence.  The Roman\nCatholic days of fasting are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.\nIn the United\n  States, fasting is observed mostly by Episcopalians and Lutherans among\nProtestants, by Orthodox and Conservative Jews, and by Roman Catholics.\nSecular Fasting: The Hunger Strike\nFrom being an empty ritual,\nfasting went to another extreme in the West: the hunger strike, a form of\nfasting, which in modern times has become a political weapon after being\npopularized by Mohandas Gandhi, leader of Indian struggle for freedom, who\nundertook fasts to compel his followers to obey his precept of nonviolence.\nFasting in Islam\nIslam has prescribed and\nretained the ritual of fasting throughout centuries as a means for purifying\nthe soul of a man in order to draw near to his Creator by selfish motives and base\ndesires of self.  It has a special status among all the devotional worships\nbecause it is difficult to perform.  It puts a bridle on the most uncontrolled,\nsavage human emotions.  The most unruly human emotions are pride, avarice,\ngluttony, lust, envy, and anger.  These emotions, by their nature are not easy\nto control, thus a person must strive hard to discipline them.  Fasting helps\ndo that.\nThe Islamic calendar consists\nof twelve lunar months. Muslims measure their year by the cycles of the moon\nrather than the sun, so the Muslim lunar year is eleven days shorter than the\nChristian solar year. Muslims are forbidden to adjust their year by adding an\nextra month, as the Jews do to keep their lunar calendar in synch with the\nseasons.  Hence, the months of the Muslim year do not relate to the seasons. \nEach month lasts 29 or 30 days and occurs during different seasons of the\nyear.  A new month begins when the evening new moon is sighted.  The ninth\nmonth is called\nRamadan\nand is dedicated to fasting.  It is pronounced\nRamazan\nby Indo-Pakistanis.\nBelow we list the virtues and\nrewards of this month and fasting in general.  In the next lesson we will learn\nhow to fast.  In the third and final installment, we will discuss the social\naspects of\nRamadan\n.  In the fourth and last lesson, we will learn about\nthe end of month activities.\nVirtues of the Month of\nRamadan\nTo motivate us and to prepare\nours"

If I don’t, I won’t incur any sin,\nbut I will get extra reward for keeping them.  In this lesson we will focus\nonly on the most important obligatory fasts that are kept in the month of\nRamadan\n.\nFasting In\nRamadan\nFasting in\nRamadan\nis one of the five\npillars of Islam as the Prophet said:\n“Islam is built on five pillars: testifying\nthat there is no true god except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, the\nestablishment of the prayer, the giving of\nzakah\n, the fast of\nRamadan\n,\nand the pilgrimage to Mecca.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nFasting in\nRamadan\nis an obligation on every\nMuslim who has reached the age of puberty.  Allah said in the Quran:\n“So whoever witnesses the month should fast it.” (Quran\n2:185)\nWhoever does not fast\nduring\nRamadan\nwithout a legitimate excuse commits what is considered\na major sin.\nWho is Exempt from Fasting?\n(1)  A Muslim child who has\nnot yet\nreached puberty\nis exempt from fasting till\none\nof the following\nsigns of puberty appear:\n(a) discharge of semen, whether by\nexperiencing a wet dream or otherwise\n(b) growth of pubic hair\n(c) menstruation\n(d) a person has turned 15\n(2)  If you are\ntraveling\nin\nRamadan\n,\nyou have the option not to fast. If you choose not to, you must make up for the\ndays missed at a later time before the following\nRamadan\n.\n(3)  A woman is not allowed to fast during\nmenstruation or post-natal bleeding, and she must perform the number of fasts\nshe missed on other days before the following\nRamadan\n.\n(4)  A\npregnant\nor\nbreast-feeding\nwoman may be exempted from fasting if it proves harmful to her or the infant.  This\ncase is discussed in more detail below.\n(5)  The\nmentally insane\nare also\nexempt from fasting.\n(6)  The Merciful Lord does not burden a\nsoul beyond its ability.  If you are\nsick\n, you are also exempt from\nfasting.\nThere are two issues to know here:\nFirst, how sick is sick?  Cough or minor\nheadache is not serious enough not to fast, but if there is medical reason, and\nyou know from experience, or are certain that fasting will make your illness\nworse or delay recovery, you do not need to fast.\nSecond, you should make up the days when\nyou get better.\nThe chronically ill who do not foresee any chance\nof recovery must feed a poor person for every day of\nRamadan\nthey miss.\nThey do not need to fast for them on other days.\n(8)  Those\ntoo old\nto fast are also\nexempt from fasting, and they too must feed a poor person for every day of\nRamadan\nthey miss.\nHow Do I Fast in\nRamadan\n?\nFirst, check with your local mosque for the beginning\nof\nRamadan\nby calling or visiting them.  Usually, mosques print a\nspecial schedule for\nRamadan\nthat will tell you the times for starting\nand ending the fast (the time of\nFajr\nand\nMaghrib\n, respectively) and\nmaybe even the time for the\nTaraweeh\nprayer.\nSecond, intend in your heart the night before\nthat you will fast the next day based on what the Prophet, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“There is no fast for the person who did\nnot intend to fast from the night before.” (\nAn-Nasa’i\n)\nThe idea is to remind yourself that one is\nfasting for the pleasure of our Creator.\nMonth:\n9/1426,\n10-11/\n2005\nC.E\nLocation:\nSeattle, WA, USA\nCalculation Method:\nISNA\nJuristic Method:\nStandard\nDay\nRamadan\nGregorian\nFajr\nSunrise\nDhuhr\nAsr\nMaghrib\nIsha\nTue\n1\n4/10\n5:50\n7:12\n12:58\n4:05\n6:43\n8:07\nWed\n2\n5/10\n5:52\n7:14\n12:58\n4:04\n6:41\n8:05\nThu\n3\n6/10\n5:53\n7:15\n12:58\n4:02\n6:39\n8:03\nFri\n4\n7/10\n5:54\n7:17\n12:58\n4:01\n6:37\n8:01\nSat\n5\n8/10\n5:56\n7:18\n12:57\n3:59\n6:35\n7:59\nSun\n6\n9/10\n5:57\n7:20\n12:57\n3:58\n6:33\n7:57\nMon\n7\n10/10\n5:59\n7:21\n12:57\n3:56\n6:31\n7:55\nFigure 1 Specimen\nRamadan\nSchedule for\nSeattle residents prepared using\nwww.islamicfinder.org\n. \nFor example, on Tuesday, the first day of\nRamadan\n, take your pre-d"

Elaborate\ndishes are prepared, new clothes are worn, presents are exchanged, and children\nhave fun.\nThe following are some recommended acts to be\nperformed on\nEid\n:\na)\nGhusl\nor bathing early in the day before the\nEid\nprayer.\nb)Beautifying\noneself: The Prophet used to wear his best clothes to go to the\nEid\nprayer. \nHe had a cloak that he wore specifically on the two\nEids\nand Friday.\nc)Saying\ntakbeer\n(proclamation of the greatness of Allah) is\na distinctive feature of\nEid\nand is mentioned in the Quran:\n…And that you should exclaim Allah's greatness\nfor having guided you, so that you may be grateful. (Quran 2:185)\nWhen?\nThe time for\nEid\ntakbeer's\nstarts\nfrom the time a person leaves his house heading towards the prayer-hall.  The\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, would leave his\nhouse on the day of\nEid\nsaying\ntakbeer\nuntil he had performed the\nprayer.  He would stop saying the\ntakbeer\nafter the prayer.\nWhat to Say?\nThere are various authentic narrations about\nwhat should be said in the\ntakbeer\n. For brevity, we will mention the one\nwhich is most common.\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akar, La ilaha ill-Allah,\nw’Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, wa lillahil-Hamd.\n[2]\nThe\nEid\nPrayer\nIslam teaches us how to celebrate these\noccasions of joy."

If you are able to attend these\nextra prayers offered usually after midnight but before the dawn prayer, you\nwill find many benefits, including the special closeness to Allah that can only\nbe experienced in the last part of the night. “Our Lord descends each night in\nthe final third of the night, and He says: ‘Who is saying a prayer to Me that I\nmay answer it? Who is asking something of Me that I may give it him? Who is\nasking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?’”\n[2]\nA believer can also use the time between prayers to make\nlonger heartfelt\ndua\n. Prophet Muhammad said, “Whoever prayed at night in\nit (the month of\nRamadan\n) out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward\nfrom Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.”\n[3]\nSearch for\nLaylat al-Qadr\nThe rewards and blessings associated with this night are\nmany. There are many references to\nLaylat al-Qadr\nin the traditions of\nProphet Muhammad. Some of these indicate that\nLaylat al-Qadr\nfalls on\none of the last ten nights of\nRamadan\n, others point to it being an odd\nnumbered night in the last ten nights. Muslims are told in the Quran that\npraying throughout this one night is better than a thousand months of prayer.\nFor this reason alone it would be wise for a person to seek out this blessed,\nholy night by taking worship in these last nights very seriously.\nGod says in the Quran,\n“Verily! We have sent it (this\nQuran) down in the Night of Decree. And what will make you know what the Night\nof Decree is? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. Therein\ndescend the angels and the Rooh (Gabriel) by Allah’s Permission with all\nDecrees. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.” (Quran 97:1-5)\nPractice\nItikaf\nAisha, the beloved wife of Prophet Muhammad reported\nthat he (Prophet Muhammad) used to practice\nItikaf\nin the last ten\nnights of\nRamadan\nand said, “Look for\nLaylat\nal-Qadr\nin the last ten nights of the month of\nRamadan\n”\n[4]\nItikaf\nis a type of retreat when a person does not leave the mosque and\nthe remembrance of God except when it is absolutely necessary such as going to\nthe bathroom.\nRenowned Islamic scholar Ibnul Qayyim described the\ngreater goal of\nitikaf\n.  “His (a person in\nItikaf\n) thoughts are\nall of remembrance of God, and thinking of how to attain His Pleasure and what\nwill cause nearness to Him. This leads him to feel contented with God instead\nof the people, so that prepares him for being at peace with Him alone on the\nday of loneliness in the grave, when there is no one else to give comfort, nor\nanyone to grant solace except Him.”\nMake Extra\nDua\nRamadan\nis a time of quiet reflection and a\nperfect opportunity to make  extra\ndua\n. This is especially true for the\nlast ten nights and we should take the opportunity to make long and heartfelt\ndua\nto Allah. Aisha always made an effort to maximise her worship. In order to do\nthis she asked Prophet Muhammad what she should say when making dua in t"

Fasting is prescribed for you as it was\nprescribed for those before you that you may gain self-restraint.”(Quran 2:183)\nFasting is an act of spiritual purification; it is an\nimportant act of worship that was legislated in order to bring a person closer\nto Allah and allow him or her to experience the benefits associated with piety. \nThroughout the day every time a person conquers his need to eat or drink he\nremembers Allah.  Abstaining from food and drink is only one dimension of\nfasting.\nAbstaining from sinful behaviours is another dimension\nthat is often overlooked.  Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of\nAllah be upon him, said that some people gain nothing from their\nsawm\nexcept hunger and thirst.\n[1]\nIn another\nhadith\nhe said that if a person does not give up false words and actions, Allah has no\nneed of him giving up food and drink.\n[2]\nFasting purifies the\nmind and helps a person gain control over his ego and base desires as well as teaches\na person how to modify his behaviour and change bad habits into good ones.\nSawm\nalso teaches compassion and empathy for those who go without food or water on a\ndaily basis.  Patience, gratitude and humility are all qualities that Muslims\nstrive to perfect and fasting is one way that help inculcate them in our daily\nlives.\nFasting is a very special act of worship because it is\nsomething that is between the fasting person and God.  God says in a\nhadith\nqudsi,\n“Fasting is for Me and I alone will reward it”.\n[3]\nThe\ndu’a\nof the fasting person will not be\nrefused.\n[4]\nThus making lots of\ndu’a\nwhen fasting and at the breaking of your fast is highly recommended.  At the\nbreaking of fast Allah chooses people to save from the fires of Hell.\n[5]\nThe end of the fast is also one of the two joyful moments associated with\nfasting.  The other is when a person meets his Lord and celebrates his\nsuccessful fasting.\n[6]\nFasting is also a strong\nfortress that keeps a person safe from the fires of Hell\n[7]\nand in addition to this, on the Day of Judgment the fasting itself will\nintercede for a person.\n[8]\nCharity (\nZakah\n)\n“Truly, those who believe, do good deeds, establish\nsalah\nand pay\nzakah\nwill have their reward with their Lord; no fear shall come\nupon them, nor will they grieve.” (Quran 2:277)\nThe word\nzakah\nis mentioned approximately 30\ntimes in the Quran and it is coupled with\nsalah\nfor almost all of them. \nIt is a great act of worship that, like fasting, offers the chance for\nspiritual purification.  In the case of\nzakah\nhowever it purifies the\nheart of both the giver and the recipient and it detaches a person from the\ngreed and stinginess often associated with wealth.  A person who diligently\npays his\nzakah\nfeels closeness to Allah and a responsibility for the\npoor and needy.  To receive\nzakah\nis also a right given by Allah.  The\nperson who receives\nzakah\nfinds his heart purified from the envy and\nhatred that the poor often have for the rich and powerful.  Thus it strengthens\nthe ties of brotherhood.\nThe word\nzakah\nliterally means that which\npurifies and it was legislated by Allah for a number of reasons.  It"

We view\nJihad\nto be among the best of deeds; shall we not then perform\nJihad\n?” He said\nto her: “\nThe best\nJihad\n(for you)\nis a\nHajj\nthat is\naccepted.”\n[3]\n3.This act of worship requires that a person dedicates all of his God-given\nfaculties to perfect it! God has promised those who perfect this act of worship\na great reward; the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsaid:\nThe accepted\nHajj\n(\nHajj Mabroor\n) has no reward except\nJannah\n(Heavenly Abode).\n[4]\n4.The Prophet was asked: “What is the best deed in the sight of\nGod?” He answered:\n“Belief in Allah!”\nHe was then asked,\n“What is\nnext?”\nHe answered:\n“\nJihad\nin the path of Allah.”\nHe was then\nasked,\n“What is next?” He said: “An accepted\nHajj\n!”\n[5]\n5.The Prophet said: “O Amr’ do you not know that\nHajj\neffaces all sins done before it?”\n[6]\n6.The Prophet said: The one who performs\nHajj\nand does not\nengage in sexual activities with his wife during\nHajj\nand does not give\ninto evil behavior (during\nHajj\n) will return from that\nHajj\nas\nthe day he was born (i.e.  sin free).\n[7]\n7.The Prophet said: “As the camel of a person coming for\nHajj\nraises and lowers its feet as it walks towards Mecca for the pilgrimage, the\nperson who has intended the\nHajj\nreceives a reward for each footstep and\na sin would be removed with each footstep and he would be elevated a rank.”\n[8]\n8.The Prophet also said: “The one performing\nHajj\nis the guest\nof Allah; He called upon them to perform this duty and they answered that call!\nThey shall ask of Him and He will respond to them.”\nConditions of\nHajj\nScholars categorize the conditions for the obligation of\nHajj\ninto various sub-categories, but in general all are agreed that the\nrelevant conditions that are applicable today include:\n1.Being a Muslim.\n2.Intellectual sanity and rational capacity .\n3.Reaching the age of puberty.\n4.Capability (financial and physical).\nThe first condition of ‘faith’ is a pre-requisite in all\nacts o"

It is called by this name, because the pilgrims would get\nready for this long day and night by feeding their animals and making sure\ntheir camels had enough water for the long journey ahead.  They would also stock\nup on water in anticipation of the long stand on the day of Arafah, which was\nusually a hot, long day!\nWhen the day of\nTarwiyah\ncomes, one should enter\nIhram\nin the morning from the place where he is in Mecca.  The Prophet, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, donned the garments of\nIhram\nat the\nDuha\ntime (the time just after sunrise till just before the sun\nreaches its zenith).  He should then say the following:\nLab’baika Haj’jan\n(Here I am O Allah performing the\nHajj\n) which indicates one’s\nintention of performing the\nHajj\n.  After that one should say the\nTalbiyah\ncontinuously:\n‘Lab’baik Al’laahum’ma Lab’baik, Lab’baika laa Shareeka\nlaka Lab’baik, In’nal Hamda wan Ni’mata laka wal Mulk, Laa Shareeka lak’.\n[1]\nYou would then proceed with your\nHajj\ngroup to\nthe area of Mina, which literally is a tent city.  Millions of people gather\nhere on this day from all corners of the globe.  It is wise that you carefully\nnote the area that you are in; each is marked with a color and an\nidentification code.  If this fails, then you can simply ask for the general\nlocation of the tents of your country.\nIt is important for one to try their best to be in Mina\nbefore the sun reaches its zenith.  The pilgrim should busy himself with the\nremembrance of Allah and recite the Quran.  One should avoid idle talk and discussion\nof worldly matters and argumentation.\nAbu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him said: “\nI\nheard the Prophet say, ‘Whoever performs\nHajj\nand does not commit any\nrafath\n(obscenity) or\nfusooq\n(transgression), he returns (free from sin) as the\nday his mother gave birth to him\n’”.  (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nWhile here, the pilgrim should perform each prayer (\nDhuhr\n,\nAsr\n,\nMaghrib\n,\nIsha\nand\nFajr\n) in its time.  They shouldn’t\ncombine prayers, but each four unit prayer is shortened to two units.\nThere is a very interesting\nmasjid\nin Mina.  It is known as Masjid Kheef.  The Prophet, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“Seventy Prophets\nperformed prayer in this\nmasjid\n.”\n(\nBaihaqi\n)\nIt is not required of one to visit that\nmasjid\nor to pray there, some may carry this belief, but there is no\nbasis for it.\nDepending on the bus schedule for your\nHajj\ngroup, you may move from Mina to the next stop in\nHajj\nshortly after the\nFajr\nprayer or before the\nDhuhr\nprayer of the 9th day of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.\nThe 9\nth\nDay of\nDhul-Hijjah\nThe 9\nth\nday of\nDhul-Hijja"

One of the best things one can do is to supplicate to Allah for all\nthat they desire in this life and in the next.  Some may perceive it to be\ninappropriate to ask Allah for worldly riches, but there is no sin in doing\nthis.  In fact, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsupplicated for Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying:\n“O Allah\nincrease him in wealth, and give him many children and bless him in that.”\n[1]\nOne\nshould make an extra effort to repent and pledge to Allah that they will turn a\nnew page in their lives.\nAt sunset, one is to leave the area of Arafah for\nMuzdalifah\n[2]\n. \nSince one will be with a\nHajj\ngroup, they may leave a bit earlier.  Upon\narriving at Muzdalifah one should perform the\nMaghrib\nprayer and\nIsha\nprayer (combining them and shortening the Isha to two units) thus allowing\noneself a good night’s rest thereafter.  A common mistake that is committed by\nmany is that they will spend their night chatting, taking selfies or surfing\nthe net.  This is inappropriate, as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of\nAllah be upon him, indicated that one should spend this night resting as much\nas they can.  One should continue saying the\nTalbiyah\nat this stage of\nthe pilgrimage.\nThe 10\nth\nDay (The Day of\nEid\n)\nThis is the ‘action-packed’ day for the pilgrim.  The\nmajority of the\nHajj\nrituals are performed herein.  It is best that one\nfollows this day’s rituals in the manner that Prophet Muhammad performed them\nin.\nUpon getting up for the Fajr prayer and performing it,\none is to utilize that time to supplicate to Allah, as well one should gather 7\nsmall ‘chickpea’ sized stones for the ritual of stoning that takes place on\nthis day.\nTaking a few extra is recommended\n.\nUsually after this, the\nHajj\ngroup will take the\npilgrims back to Mina, where they will stone the biggest pillar, which is\nclosest to Mecca.  This pillar is known as Jamaratul-Aqabah.  It should be\nnoted that these pillars are not the ‘devil’, but simply a pillar.  In relation\nto the reason behind this ritual, one can find its roots in the story of\nProphet Abraham and Ismail, peace be upon them both.  The devil had approached\nIsmail and tried to convince him to disobey his father in these three locations. \nToday stoning is conducted in obedience to the commandment of our Prophet.  With\neach stone that is thrown one is to say ‘\nAllahu Akbar\n’.\nAfter stoning the Jamratul-Aqabah, one is to have their\nsacrificial animal slaughtered.  Nowadays, this process is more or less\nautomated through one of the large corporations that takes care of this on\nbehalf of the pilgrims.  Once this step is ascertained, one can shave off or\ntrim their hair evenly.  For women, it is sufficient to clip off a small amount\nof hair.\nOnce these actions are completed, one would then head\ntowards the Haram to perform what is known as\nTawaf\nAl-Ifaadah, and the\nSa’ee\nof\nHajj\n.  These are the five actions that one should perform in this day. \nOnce the\nTawaf\nis about to be performed, one should stop saying the\nTalbiyah\nand instead say: “\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La ilaahah il-lal-lah.  Allahu\nAkbar, Allahu Akbar, Wa-lil-laahil-hamd\n”.\n[3]\nDue to the infinite mercy of Islam, the Prophet gave\nus permits which make it easy for us this great undertaking.  Imagine, if all\nthe pilgrims had to strictly follow this order, what immense and massive\ndifficulty would there be upon people! In fact, the Prophet, was approached by\nmany companions who had informed him that they did not do the actions of this\nday in his sequence.  The Prophet said to them:\n“You may do that, and there\nis no sin upon you!”\nOne Companion even came to him and said: “O Prophet of\nAllah, I performed\nSa’ee\nbefore I made the\nTawaf\n!” The Prophet\nsaid:\n“You may do that, and there is no sin upon you!”\n[4]\nIf this is the pilgrims first\nHajj\n, they should\nstay with their groups.  Getting lost during any stage of\nHajj\nwill be a\nmemorable exp"

Upon saying\nthis one enters the state of\nIhram\n.\nThey would then begin to chant the\nTalbiyah\nsaying:\n“Labbaik Allaahumma labbaik, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik, innal-hamda\nwan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak”\n[5]\n.\nThey continue to chant this until they reach the\nKabah\nand\nbegin to perform the\nTawaf\n.  A man is to uncover his right shoulder\nthroughout the\nTawaf\n; this is done by placing the middle part of the\nRidaa\nunder the right arm and tossing both ends of the sheet on the left shoulder.\nThereafter one is to circumambulate around the\nKabah\nseven times; each time begins from the Black Stone.  One is not required to\nphysically touch or kiss it, but when one is in line with it, they begin their\ncircumambulation at that point.  During the\nTawaf\none should be mindful\nof Allah, asking of Him and begging for His mercy.  One should avoid\nidle talk and laughter, for this maybe a once in a lifetime\nchance which should not be squandered heedlessly!\nIt is praiseworthy for one to walk with a faster pace in\nthe first three rounds.\nThe Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, would say the following between the Yemeni corner and the Black\nStone:\nRabbanaa"

As covered in part one, entering the\nstate of\nIhram\nis a pillar of this great ritual. Since it is a very\nessential part of the\nUmrah\nand\nHajj\nexperience, it is necessary\nto shed further light on the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of this state.\nPraiseworthy Practices\n1.It is preferable to take the ritual bath before entering the\nstate of\nIhram\n.\n2.Cutting the fingernails, shortening the mustache, and\nplucking/shaving armpit and pubic hair before entering the state of\nIhram\n.\n3.Entering the state of\nIhram\nafter performing an\nobligatoryprayer.\n[1]\n4.Saying the\nTalbiyah\n: ‘\nLabbaik Allaahumma labbaik…\n’\nafter entering the state of\nIhram\n. Men should raise their voices while\nsaying it and women can say it quietly to themselves.\nPractices that should be avoided\nPractices that should be avoided are referred to as ‘\nMahdthoorat’\nof\nIhram\n. These actions are not lawful for one who is in the state of\nIhram\n.\nThey are divided into three categories; one specific to men, one specific to\nwomen and one that is relevant to both.\nProhibited for Men and Women during the state of\nIhram\n:\n1.Cutting hair or shaving it from any part of the body.\n2.Clipping fingernails or toenails.\n3.Wearing perfume, regardless how subtle the scent.\n4.Hunting game animals.\n5.Consummating Marriage.\n6.\nMubasharah\n(i.e. contacting a woman skin to skin) or\ndoing a thing which may lead to it such as kissing or fondling.\n7.Sexual intercourse.\nSpecifically Prohibited for Men:\n1.Covering the head directly with a hat or a turban. Umbrellas or\nsitting in the shade of a vehicle or in a tent are allowed.\n2.Wearing sewn garments that are usually worn, such as\nunder-pants, t-shirts and other similar articles of clothing.\nSpecifically Prohibited for Women:\nA woman should not cover her face unless men pass by\nher. She can wear whatever she wants as long as it conforms to the Islamic\ndress code, and she should cover her hair and she should not wear gloves.\nDoing the\nMahdthoorat\nignorantly\nIf someone does one of these ignorantly he is excused. Whoever\ndoes one of the above\nMahdthoorat\nafter entering the state of\nIhram\nintentionally\nwould have committed a sin, and would be required to fast\nthree days or feed six poor/needy individuals.\nPractices that are Lawful\n1.Taking a shower.\n2.Wearing a ring.\n3.Wearing a belt.\n4.Wearing sandals.\n5.Using an umbrella.\n6.Using a bandage.\n7.Riding a bus.\n8.Wearing a watch.\n9.Wearing sunglasses.\nUnauthentic Practices\nDue to the sheer number of people who come from all\nwalks of life for the\nUmrah\nthroughout the course of the year, it is\nimportant that one not give in to popular beliefs that may be carried by some.\nIslam is a religion of ease, not difficulty! Allah, the Exalted, says:\n“And thus we have made you a just/moderate nation.” (Quran 2:143)\nIn light of this verse, we will mention here some odd\nbeliefs carried by some. One should be watchful for them and not subscribe to\nthem:\n1.Believing that you need a special pair of sandals for\nUmrah\n.\n2.Entering the state of\nIhram\nbefore the\nMiqat\nstation.\n3.Chanting\nTalbiyah\nin a unison voice with a group.\n4.Raising the hands, as done in prayer, when facing the Black\nStone.\n5.Putting the right hand on the left hand during the\nTawaf\n(circumambulation around the\nKabah\n)\n6.Making a specific supplication at each of the corners of the\nKabah\n.\n7.Kissing the Yemeni corner\n[2]\n.\n8.Seeking blessings from the\nKabah\nby wiping its walls with\na cloth or with the garment of\nIhram\n.\n9.Kissing and touching\nMaqam\nof Ibrahim (Station of\nIbrahim).\n10.Praying two\nrakahs\nafter completing the\nSa'ee\n.\nIt is important for a Muslim to always follow the\nexample of our beloved Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be"

Our\nProphet told us,\n“They are days of eating, drinking, and remembrance\nof Allah.”\n[1]\nIn other words, we can enjoy and have\nhalal\n,\nwholesome fun without forgetting our Creator.\nBefore\nEid ul-Adha\nAs stated earlier,\nEid ul-Adha\nis tied to\nHajj\n. \nPerforming\nHajj\nis one of the five pillars of Islam that is performed in\nthe 12\nth\nmonth of the Islamic calendar known as “\nDhul-Hijjah\n.”\nEid ul-Adha\nis celebrated by Muslims all over the world on the 10\nth\nday of the month of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.  The first ten days of this month have\na special merit.  In Arabic, they are known as\n‘al-Ayyam ul-Ashr.’\nThe\nseason of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s\nfaults and make up for shortcomings or anything that one might have missed.\nVirtues of the ‘Ten Days’\nThe following are five virtues of the\n‘al-Ayyam\nul-Ashr’\n(the Ten Days):\n1.    Allah swears an oath by them in the Quran,\nand swearing an oath by something shows us it’s paramount significance and genuine\nbenefit.  Allah says:\n“By the dawn; by the ten nights” (Quran 89:1-2)\nEarly authorities of Quran have\nexplained that this verse refers to the first ten days of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.\n2.    To further convince us of their merit, the Prophet\ntestified that these are the “best”\ndays\nin the world.  The\nTen\nDays\nare better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the\nlast ten days of\nRamadan\n! But the last ten\nnights\nof\nRamadan\nare better, because they include\nLaylat al-Qadr\n(“the Night of Power”).\n3.    There are no days greater in the sight of\nAllah and in which good deeds are more loved by Him than these ten days, so a\nMuslim must frequently recite “\nSubhanAllah\n”, “\nAlhamdulillah\n” and “\nAllahu\nAkbar\n” during this time.\n4.    The Ten Days include the days of sacrifice\nand\nHajj\n.\n5.    The 9th day of\nDhul-Hijjah\nis called\n‘Yaum\nul Arafah’\n(The Day of\nArafah\n).  This is the day when the pilgrims\nassemble on the plain of\nArafah\n, six miles away from Mecca.  The Day of\nArafah\nitself has many virtues.\nVirtues And Practices of\nDay of Arafah\n1.\nYaum al-Arafah\nis the day on which\nAllah completed the religion of Islam.\n2.\nYaum al-Arafah\nis one of the biggest\ngatherings of any place in the world.\n3.\nYaum al-Arafah\nis a day on which prayers"

sacrificial animal.\nUnderstanding Animal Offerings on\nEid ul-Adha\nSacrificing one’s son was a test of Abraham’s faith.  To\ncommemorate and remember Abraham’s trials, Muslims slaughter an animal such as\na sheep, camel, or goat.  The practice is often misunderstood by those outside of\nthe faith.  Therefore, several points must be understood here:\nFirst, there are no special\nrituals involved, other than the animal meeting certain requirements.  The\nanimal is slaughtered in the same way it is slaughtered any other time in the year. \nThe only difference is in the intention.  For regular slaughter, the intention\nis the meat, but for\nEid ul-Adha\n, it is to worship Allah by commemorating\nAbraham’s trial.\nTwo, God’s Name is\npronounced since Allah has given us power over animals and allowed us to\nconsume their meat, but only in His Name.  By saying the Name of Allah at the\ntime of slaughter, we remind ourselves that even the life of an animal is\nsacred and we can only take away it’s life in the Name of the One who gave it\nin the first place.\nThree, good acts atone for\none’s sins.  Offering\nudhiyyah\nis an act of worship that is no exception. \nProphet Muhammad said that the most beloved deed on\nEid ul-Adha\nis\noffering the\nudhiyyah\nand that it will come on the Day of Resurrection\nwith its horns, cloven hoofs, and hair.  Its blood is accepted by Allah before\nit reaches the ground.  “So let your heart delight in it.” (Tirmidhi, Ibn\nMajah)\nLaws of\nUdhiyyah\nfor\nEid ul-Adha\na)  Type of Animal\nA single\nsheep\ncan be offered as a sacrifice for\na single person or a family.  “At the time of the Messenger of Allah, a man\nwould sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household,\nand they would eat from it and give some to others.”\n[1]\nA camel or cow is\nsufficient for seven people, because of the report\n“A cow would be\nsacrificed on behalf of seven men and we would share it.”\n[2]\nb)  Age of Animal\nThe animal should be of a certain age to be fit for\nudhiyyah\n. \nThe minimum ages are:\na)6 months for a lamb or sheep.\nb)1\nyear for a goat.\nc)2 years for a cow.\nd)5\nyears for a camel.\nc)  Characteristics of the Animal\nIt should be free of any faults, because the Prophet\nsaid,\n“There are four that will not do for sacrifice:\na)\na one-eyed animal whose defect is obvious,\nb)\na sick animal whose sickness is obvious,\nc)\na lame animal whose limp is obvious and\nd)\nan emaciated animal that has no marrow in its bones.”\n[3]\nThere are milder defects that do not disqualify an\nanimal, but it is disliked to sacrifice such animals, like an animal with a\nhorn or ear missing, or with slits in its ears, etc.  If the animal is\ncastrated, it is not considered a fault.\nd)  Time of Sacrifice\nIt should be sacrificed at the specified time, which is after\nthe prayer and\nkhutbah\nof\nEid ul-Adha\nhas concluded until before\nsunset of the 13th day of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.  The Prophet said:\n“Whoever sacrifices before the prayer let him repeat\nit.”\n[4]\nThe meat from the sacrifice of\nEid ul-Adha\nis\neaten by family and relatives, given away to friends, and donated to the poor. \nWe recognize that all blessings come from Allah, and we should open our hearts\nand share with others.\nCalendar of Eid ul-Adha from 2013-2015 CE\nThe exact dates of Eid ul-Adha will be determined based\non moon sighting, but the rough dates are as follows:\nTue Oct 15    2013\nSun Oct 5      2014\nThu Sep 24    2015\nSunnahs\n(Recommended deeds) of\nEid al-Adha\nThe following are recommended acts that bring additional\nreward on\nEid ul-Adha\n.  No need to worry if you forget some, but try to\ndo as many as possible to maximize your reward.\n1.The Prophet used to take a complete ritual bath (\nghusl\n) on\nthe day of\nEid\n.\n2.The Prophet used to wear his best clothes to go to the\nEid\nprayer.  Both men and women should observe the proper, modest Islamic dress when\nthey go out for the\nEid\nprayer.\n3.The Prophet would take different routes for going and coming\nback from the\nEid\nprayer.\n4.Another\nsunnah\n(recommended deed) is to pronounce Allah’s\ngreatness with these words:\nAllahu\nakbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha il-lal-lah, wa-Allah"

It\nconsists of two\nrakahs\n, with extra\ntakbirs\n(saying ‘Allahu\nAkbar’). The wisdom behind the\nEid\nprayers, like the\nEid\ndays\nthemselves, is to thank Allah for His countless blessings. The\nimam\nwill\npray in one of two ways. He will explain how he is praying before the beginning\nof the prayer:\nMETHOD 1\nIn the first\nrakah\nof the\nEid\nprayer, the\nimam\nwill offer 3 additional\ntakbirs\nafter the\nTakbiratul-Ihram\nand\nopening supplication but before reciting the\nFatihah\n. Raise your hands\nwith each\ntakbir\n, as one does for\nTakbiratul-Ihram\n. After each\ntakbir\n,\nlet the hands rest at the sides. Place hands together after the third and final\ntakbir\n. After this, the rest of the\nrakah\nis the same.\nIn the second\nrakah\nof the\nEid\nprayer the\nimam\nwill recite the\nFatihah\nand some portion of the Quran. He will then say\n3 additional\ntakbirs\n. They are like the first\nrakah’s\ntakbirs\n,\nexcept that you leave your hands to your sides after the third\ntakbir.\nAfter\nthese three\ntakbirs\nhave been called and completed, one says the\ntakbir\nfor going into\nruku\n, without raising one’s hands.\nMETHOD 2\nLike any prayer, the prayer begins with\nTakbiratul-Ihram\nfollowed by the opening supplication. It is followed by 7\ntakbeers\nin\nthe first\nrakah\nand 5 additional\ntakbeers\nin the second\nrakah\n.\nRest of the prayer is like any other prayer.\nGreetings Exchanged On\nEid ul-Adha\nNot knowing the greetings flying around during\nEid\ncan be an uncomfortable experience. Not exchanging any greeting is perfectly\nacceptable in Islam, but socially awkward. Therefore, knowing what are the\ngreetings and their appropriate response will help you with social acceptance.\nPeople from India and Pakistan congratulate one another\nby saying “\nEid Mubarak\n” (Blessed\nEid\n).\nArabs tend to say “Eid Saeed” (Happy Eid) or ‘\nkullu\n‘aam wa antum bi-khair\n’ (may each year bring you good health).\nThe Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say, ‘\ntaqabalallahu\nminna wa minkum\n’ (May Allah accept it from us and from you).\nThey are all fine. Simply respond by repeating the same greeting\nback! It will be fine if you smile or ask for help in repeating back the words.\nAdvice for\nEid ul-Adha\n1.    Take the day of\nEid\noff from work or school.\nIf you cannot, please make arrangements for time off for at least the\nEid\nprayer.\n2.    Make arrangements for the sacrificial animal\nahead of time. You can go with local Muslims to a ranch or a slaughter house.\nIt will be an experience you will not forget! You may want to slaughter the\nanimal yourself or you can have a fellow Muslim do it for you. You can also\nsend money to an Islamic charity to do it on your behalf and they will distribute\nthe meat to the poor. For millions of Muslims it is the only time in the year\nthey get to eat meat. You can locate many charities by doing an online search\nfor “udhiyyah 2013.”\nAt least for the first few years after accepting Islam,\nI will recommend that you simply send the money to feed poor Muslims overseas\neither through your mosque or one of the online Islamic relief organizations.  You\ncan join the local Muslims to get the experience if you like. Costs of doing\nudhiyyah\noverseas will vary based on the country you want it to be performed in. A few\norganizations are listed below, you can find many more online:\nhttp://www.irusa.org\nhttp://icnarelief.org\nwww.zakat.org\n3.    Call your local mosque or Islamic center a\nweek before\nEid ul-Adha\nto find out the time and place where\nEid\nul-Adha\nprayer will be held. After the\nEid\nprayer, ethnic sweets and\nfoods are usually served. Most mosques will hold\nEid\ndinners either in\nthe evening or within the next few days. Find out when and where they are and\nattend them.\n4.    Do not get lonely or feel isolated. Make\narrangements with your Muslim friends or families ahead of time to visit them for\nEid ul-Adha\n. Invite Muslim friends and cook for them. If you can’t cook,\neat out with them. Try to involve your non-Muslim family members by taking them\nto"

this is\nriyaa\nand it may nullify\nthe rewards that a believer is seeking.  More information about\nriyaa\ncan be found here,\nhttp://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/96/\nand will be discussed further in part 2.\n“And whether you hide what is in your breast or reveal it,\nAllah knows it…” (Quran 3:29)\n“…And if you join others in worship with Allah surely your\ndeeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers.” (Quran 39:65)\nIn order that a believer’s deeds and actions are\naccepted by Allah they must be performed with\nikhlas\n, they must be\npreceded by the right intention and they must be carried out according to the\nshariah\n.\n“And they were commanded not but they should worship Allah and\nworship none but him alone, and give\nzakah\n, and that is the right\nreligion.” (Quran 98:5)\nProphet Muhammad emphasised that, “Allah is Pure and He\naccepts only that which is pure”\n[1]\nthus\nthe\nSunnah\ngives prominence to the fact that Allah accepts only that\nwhich is pure and done solely for His sake.  For example, Khalid ibn al-Walid\nwas removed from his post as commander of the army by Caliph Umar.  Rather than\nbeing offended and refusing to fight, Khalid fought even harder.  When he was\nasked why, he said: “I fight for Allah not for Umar.”\nSay, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and\nmy dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (Quran 6:162)\nThe acceptance of a person’s deeds by Allah depends on\npurity and sincerity; because it is with such\nikhlas\nthat a person can\nattain a high rank in the sight of Allah.   In fact with the right intention and\na pure heart a person can even be rewarded for an action that they were unable\nto perform.  Prophet Muhammad said, “Verily Allah has recorded the good deeds\nand the evil deeds.” He then informed those around him that, “Whosoever intends\nto do a good deed but does not do it, Allah records it with Himself as a\ncomplete good deed…”\n[2]\nEveryday life causes our le"

i-e, riyaa\n.\nRiyaa\nis in fact\nminor\nshirk\n, it makes us focus on gaining the admiration and\nappreciation of people rather than seeking to please Allah.\nA great scholar of Islam once said, “Indeed\nthe hardest thing to achieve in this world is\nikhlas\n.  How many times\nhave I struggled to extinguish\nriyaa\n(showing off) from my heart except\nthat it only appeared again in a different colour”?\n[1]\nIt is clear from\nthis statement that even the most educated people struggle to remain sincere\nand avoid\nriyaa.\nBut indeed it is something that we must avoid.   Prophet\nMuhammad said that it was the thing he feared most for his\nUmmah\n.  “Indeed\nthe thing that I fear most for you is the minor\nshirk\n,” he said.  The\nsahabah\nasked, “And what is minor\nshirk\n, Oh Messenger of Allah?” To which he\nreplied, “It is\nRiyaa\n.  Allah will say to the people of\nriyaa\non\nthe Day of Judgement – when the people are being re-payed for their deeds – ‘Go\nto those who you showed off your deeds to in the\ndunya\n, and see if you\ncan find reward from them!’”\n[2]\nThere is also a\nhadith qudsi\nin\nwhich Allah says, “I am Independent of all the partners (ascribed to me).  Whoever\nperforms a deed while associating partners with Me, I will leave him and\nhis\nshirk\n.”\n[3]\nRiyaa\ncan be defined as the performance of a deed with the intention\nof pleasing someone or something other than Allah.  It is a form of\nshirk\nand something to be feared because it is easy to fall into\nriyaa\nwithout\nnoticing.\nOur good deeds and actions can be\nnullified by\nriyaa\n.  Let us take the example of a man who has $100 he\nwants to give in charity.   He begins his act of charity with a pure and\nsincere heart and donates $50 but then the idea of showing how rich he is\noccurs to him so he makes quite a performance of giving another $50.   It is\npossible that Allah will reject the second $50 as an act of charity because it\nwas mixed with a desire to show off.  If however the idea of showing off\noccurred after the total $100 had been distributed it would not affect or\ninvalidate the act of charity.\nHaving said this it is important to\nbear in mind that it is not showing off if a person feels happy after doing an\nact of worship.  This is a sign of faith.   Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said “Whoever feels happy because of his good\ndeeds and sad because of his bad deeds, is a believer.”\n[4]\nIn addition, if people praise you for a\ngood deed it is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of, it is a porti"

jumping out of your skin\nexciting.  Thus on discovery, the first thing you want to do is tell other\npeople, and sometimes just blurting out one of life’s universal truths can be a\nlittle bit confronting.  Some might think you are crazy or deluded, but that is\nnot the problem, because that puts you in such noble company as Prophet\nMuhammad or Prophet Noah.  The problem is that when we invite people to the\ntruth of Islam we want them to listen and understand just what it is we are\ntrying to say.  Therefore for the benefit of those jumping out of their skin we\nwill discuss a few tips for inviting others to the right path.\nFirst off let us get our definitions in sync.  The verb,\ninvite,\nmeans to request the presence or participation of in a kindly,\ncourteous, or complimentary way.\n[1]\nShariah\nliterally means ‘a path to water,’ the source of all life, thus\nIslamically\nShariah\nis the straight path to Allah, the Giver and\nOriginator of all life.   Allah tells us to:\n“Invite (call) to the way of your\nRabb\nwith wisdom and\nbeautiful preaching and argue with them in a way that is better...”  (Qur’an\n16:125)\nWhenever we invite a person to Islam, to the right path,\nwe are presenting them with the attractions and allurements of Islam.   Our job\nis to deliver the message in the best way possible according to our knowledge\nand abilities.  Acceptance or rejection of the message is up to the person\nconcerned; there is no compulsion in religion and moreover it is Allah who\nbestows guidance.\nWe\nare not converting or reverting them because it is\nAllah, and Allah only that truly does that.  Our role is only to assist others\non their journey or to plant a seed that will one day,\nInshaAllah\n, grow\ninto a tree of Islam.\n“Let there be no compulsion in religion.  Truth has been made\nclear from error…” (Quran 2:256)\n“…Say, ‘To Allah belongs the east and the west.  He guides\nwhom He wills to a straight path.’” (Quran 2:142)\nIt is important to remember however that conveying the\nmessage and calling people to Islam or giving\ndawah\n, as many like to\ncall it, is an obligation upon all Muslims.  Of course we are not all expected\nto work in the field of\ndawah\nbut we are expected to be aware at all\ntimes that our behaviour, words and actions, are\ndawah\n.  Those not\nfamiliar with Islam look to Muslims to see just what this religion is all about. \nProphet Muhammad said, “Convey from me, even if it is one verse”.\n[2]\nQuran also\nreiterates the same message.\n“...  And who is better in speech than one who invites to\nAllah and does righteousness and says, ‘Indeed, I am of the Muslims. ’” (Quran\n41:33)\nIt all sounds very easy doesn’t it?  We all love Allah\nand His Messenger Muhammad and without a doubt we hope that all people will one\nday feel the same way.  However love for Islam and all it entails is not quite\nenough.  When one accepts the challenge to convey the message one needs to be\nprepared.  No longer can we scowl at the shopkeeper when prices rise.  No\nlonger can we react with anger when somebody mumbles an insult as we walk by.  A\nperson delivering the message of Islam must be prepared to accept insults, be\npatient, make sacrifices, and listen to ideas and ideologies that are far from\nthe truth of Islam.  Prophet Muhammad said that, “The believer who mixes with\npeople and bears their insults with patience is better than the one who does\nnot mix with people or bear their insults with patience.”\n[3]\nAnyone who is recognisably Muslim is conveying the\nmessage every time they appear in public or mix with non-believers, therefore our\nwords should always be kind and gentle, and our temper must be completely under\ncontrol so that harsh words never leave our mouths.  One of Prophet Muhammad’s\ncompanions said, “We smile at people even if in our hearts we are cursing their\nwords or behaviour”.\n[4]\nMoreover a Muslim makes things easy for others.  This is what Allah expects and\nProphet Muhammad encouraged when he said, “Teach and make things easy, do not\nmake them difficult.  If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.”\n[5]\n“...  Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make\nthings difficult for you…” (Quran 2:185)\nProphet Muhammad understood human weaknesses and at the\nsame time understood human potential for excellence.  His\ndawah\nmet"

The evil eye\nincorporates this aspect, as well it goes beyond by the nature of one’s\nself…the jealousy and pure hatred a person has for a blessing someone is\nblessed with and the burning desire that he has to see it removed. Everyone who\nputs the “evil eye” on another is envious, but everyone who envies does not put\nthe “evil eye” on another.\nWitchcraft and sorcery\nWitchcraft and sorcery are real and may\naffect people psychologically and physically, so that they become sick and even\nhusbands and wives can be separated.  Most of it is done by means of\nShirk\nand by offering demons what they love.\nThe truth is that in and of itself, nothing is capable of\nhurting you unless Allah allows it to.  In other words, you should have a firm\nbelief that Allah is in control, not any created being.  That is why, a Muslim\nshould not let paranoia, anxiety, doubts, suspicion, and excessive fear of the paranormal\noverwhelm him so much that he becomes afflicted with psychological illnesses.  One\nshould think positively about Allah and understand that whatever befalls only\nhappens by the permission of Allah.  Evil is not outside of Allah’s control.  There\nis no sorcerer, demon, or “evil eye” that is stronger than Allah.  Since, He is\nin control, He alone is able to ward off harm and relieve distress.  If this is\nunderstood, a person will turn to Allah and put his complete faith in Him.\nIn order to properly trust Allah, a Muslim must have the\ncorrect belief and knowledge.  First, Allah knows what’s best.  Allah says in\nthe Quran,\n“… Perhaps you may dislike something and it is good for you\nand you may like something and it is bad for you.  Allah knows and you do not\nknow.” (Quran 2:216)\nSecond, Allah is Just.  He tells us,\n“… And your Lord will not wrong anyone.” (Quran 18:49)\nThird, Allah is sufficient for anyone who puts their\ntrust in Him.  He has declared,\n“…And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice\nhim...” (Quran 65:3)\nA Muslim can protect himself by giving up sins, carrying\nout obligatory religious duties, having strong faith in Allah, by putting his\ntrust in Him as explained above, and seeking refuge with Him by reciting the\nprayers for protection narrated from Prophet Muhammad.\nWhat will follow in the"

 You have no other deity other than Him.  Certainly, I fear for\nyou the torment of a Great Day!’” (Quran 7:59)\nAccording to learned people both past and present, any\ncall to Islam that does not begin with\nTawheed\nis doomed to failure.   Prophet\nMuhammad instructed the\nsahabah\nto preach\nTawheed\nwhen sending\nthem to various communities.  To those who went to Yemen he said, “You are\ngoing to the People of the Book, so let the first thing that you invite them to\nbe the\nTawheed\nof Allah”.\n[1]\nThe title ‘People of the Book’ refers to the Jews and\nthe Christians, those given scriptures for guidance before the Quran was\nrevealed.   It is often easier to start a conversation about Islam with Christians\nand Jews because they already believe in God.  Quran is filled with references,\nand stories that can be easily related to and to which they already have their\nown versions.  For instance mentioning the\nsurahs\nof Quran that are\nnamed after easily recognisable people such as\nsurah\n19 – Maryam (Mary),\nsurah\n14 - Ibrahim  (Abraham) or\nsurah\n12 – Yusuf (Joseph).\nQuran beseeches Prophet Muhammad to call the People of\nthe Book to Islam.  And Prophet Muhammad in his\nSunnah\nmade clear the\nrelationship between all of the prophets and messengers of Allah.\n“Say O Muhammad ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and\nChristians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship\nnone but God (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none\nof us shall take others as lords besides God.’” (Quran 3:64)\n“And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be\nin (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say, ‘We\nbelieve in that which has been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God\nand your God is One, and to Him we have submitted’”.  (Quran 29:46)\n“I am the nearest of all the people to the son of\nMary, and all the prophets are brothers and there is none between me and him (i.e. \nthere is no other prophet between me and Jesus).”\n[2]\n“If a man believes in Jesus and then believes in me\nhe will get double reward.”\n[3]\nPeople who have no understanding of any of the three\nmonotheistic religions, such as Buddhists require different guidelines.  It is the\nresponsibility of the person giving\ndawah\nto have a basic understanding\nof the beliefs of the non-believers they are calling to.  Buddhism for instance\nis a way of life, but not in the same sense as Islam.  Put simply Buddhism, as\nwell as many eastern religions have a concept by which the person who does good\nactions will eventually attain Godlike qualities.   On the other hand Hindus\nbelieve in one Supreme God among many, and some of the more obscure religions\nsuch as Zoroastrianism and Baha’i do include the concept of One Supreme God.  However,\nyou do not want to speak down to anyone as if you know more about their belief\nsystem then they do themselves.  This is important whether that is the case or\nnot.  Remember, you do not want to offend anybody or inadvertently start an\nargument.  More information about other religious beliefs can be found on our\nother website\nwww.islamreligion.com\n.\nIf a person has a strong belief in God or even a\nnameless Supreme Being responsible for the creation, it is possible to teach\nthem that the God we call Allah is the same God that they call by other names\nsuch as Elohim or Yahweh."

As mentioned\nearlier it is Allah that provides the guidance and the desire to accept Islam.\nRemember that whenever we intend to convey the message we must do so with\nwisdom, eloquent speech and in the most gracious manner. Arguments and heated\ndiscussions are not the best methods of\ndawah.\nOne who has accepted Islam must convey the message to\nthose nearest and dearest to him. Once a person has tasted the sweetness of\nfaith it becomes impossible not to desire that for all family members and\nfriends. Calling family members must be a first priority but sometimes it can\nbe the hardest work of all. Sometimes when you are the first member of your\nfamily to heed the message you plunge the other members of your family into a\nstate of shock; especially if they do not mix with any Muslims in their daily\nlives.\nYour family needs a little time to accept the reality.\nMake sure you have a supply of easy to read small books or pamphlets. If you\nlive at home you could leave them lying around, if not keep a supply in your\nbag or car. People often want to know this or that and sometimes you simply do\nnot know the answer to all those questions. You are often just learning\nyourself so don’t be tempted to make up an answer. Perhaps you could look it up\ntogether remembering to always emphasis the Oneness of Allah, the Creator of\nall that exists.\nYour family and close friends will be watching closely\nand this is when your behaviour will play a big part. You have probably given\nup a lot of big things such as alcohol, parties, free mixing with the opposite gender,\nand pork and pork products.  However, you have also added lots of little things;\nmore kind acts, generosity, eagerness to be helpful, more gracious manners and\na desire to establish strong unbreakable family ties. Showing kindness and\nobserving high moral standards is possibly the best way to introduce someone to\nIslam. Good manners and courteous behaviour is also a very good form of\ndawah\n.\nYou are a role model for what Islam is all about.\nProphet Muhammad’s behaviour attracted others to Islam.\nHis beloved wife Aisha called his character a living example of the Quran.\n[1]\nHe was kind and courteous to everybody and even his enemies could not help but\npraise his noble character. This is the behaviour we must endeavour to emulate\nand the people that will benefit the most are our family and close friends. A\nkind word, a smile, a gift, or help of any sort, will showcase the beauty of\nIslam.\nBe particularly careful not to despair when you see your\nfamily or friends engaging in behaviour that you now consider misconduct. Do\nnot abandon them because of their ways. You can leave their company if they are\ndrinking alcohol or acting in a non-Islamic manner - abandon the place, or the\nsituation, not the person. Invite them to your house and to your events so they\ncan see that fun and happiness can be found without alcohol or distasteful\nentertainment.\nConversations at your workplace are also a way to spread\nthe message of Islam. Handing out pamphlets probably isn’t going to win you any\nfriends or influence people but your mannerisms and ways of dealing with people\nwill. Remember however that your colleagues are likely to be as shocked as your\nfamily. If you have recently converted to Islam don’t expect fanfare and\ncongratulations but do expect curiosity. Again don’t give unqualified answers\nto things you are not sure about. The one thing you are sure about is the\nOneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped.\nNever give up hope. You may not see the people you love\nentering Islam and it can be a source of great disappointment. However it is\nwise to remember that it is Allah that guides a person to the right path.  Your\nrole in that process might be as little as being a friendly face in an\notherwise bleak day. Hope is something that Muslims have in abundance, so make\nsmall efforts and lots of\ndu’a\nfor the people you love and those around\nyou.\nSpreading the message and calling people to the right\npath is the work that was carried out by all of Allah’s messengers. Each one\ncalled his own people to the One God, Allah.  Prophet Muhammad however was sent\nto all of humankind; he gave the good news to the believers of immense reward\nin the Hereafter, and warning the unbelievers against a severe punishment.\nProphet Muhammad expected all of those"

It is one who has not uttered the two testimonies, lacks\nthe correct Islamic faith (\nimaan\n), or holds a belief, says a word, or\ndoes an act of disbelief.\nThere is an important point to be understood here.  If a\nperson who becomes a Muslim by uttering the Testimony of Faith (\nshahadah\n)\nholds a belief, says, or does what is considered\nkufr\n, he may not necessarily\nbecome a disbeliever.  The reason is that after becoming a Muslim, there are\ncertain obstacles that prevent a person from becoming a\nkafir\n.\nReasons That Prevent a Person from Becoming a Disbeliever\nA Muslim might fall into disbelief, but not become a disbeliever\ndue to one of the following reasons:\n[2]\n1.Ignorance\nA convert, a Muslim who grew up in a remote area, or a\nMuslim who was raised in an irreligious environment may be ignorant of the\nbasic beliefs, religious duties, and prohibitions of Islam.  Such a person may\nnot know, for example, that Islam prohibits homosexuality or requires prayers\nfive times a day.  These people may fall into disbelief, but will not become disbelievers\nbecause in the sight of Allah they may be excused due to their ignorance.\n2.Mistake\nA person may miss the mark and do something he never\nintended.  He may simply make an unintentional, honest mistake.  For example,\nif a convert to Islam believes that consuming alcohol is only forbidden at\nprayer times. From a textual perspective, consuming alcohol, while believing it\nto be lawful, is an act of disbelief, but this person would not become a\ndisbeliever because of the honest mistake h"

Otherwise, we do not consider\npeople to become non-Muslims on account of a sin they commit.\nThe proof that a person who commits a sin is considered\nMuslim is found in the Quran and Prophetic Traditions:\n1.The Quran says:\n“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up\nwith him in worship but He will forgive whoever He wishes for anything besides\nthat.” (Quran 4:48)\n2.Whoever dies without committing\nshirk\nwith Allah shall\nenter Paradise.\n[2]\n3.A person who believes in\nTawheed\nwill enter Paradise even\nif he fornicates and steals.\n[3]\nThere was an alcoholic in the time of the Prophet.  One\ntime when he was punished, a Muslim cursed him.  The Prophet forbade that Muslim\nfrom cursing that Companion and he said: ‘Do not curse him, for by Allah, he\nloves Allah and His Messenger.’\n[4]\nDue to his belief in Allah and His Prophet, the major sin that he was doing did\nnot wipe out all his faith.\nHow Are Major Sins Forgiven?\nMajor sin can be forgiven by the following ways:\na)    Through sincere repentance, which entails\nleaving the sin, having remorse for performing it, and resolving to never\nperform it again.  If the sin involves wrongdoing towards others, then in\naddition to the above, he must also restore their rights or property or seek\ntheir forgiveness.\nWhen Allah sees this\nsincere repentance from one of His slaves – a slave who truly turns to his Lord\nin fear and hope – He not only\nforgives\nthe sin, but\nreplaces\nthose sins for good deeds to the slave’s credit.  This is from Allah’s infinite\ngrace and mercy.  Allah says this right after mentioning the sins of\nshirk\n,\nmurder, and adultery, He says: “Except those who repent and believe, and do\nrighteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and\nAllah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Quran 25:70)  This blessing is only\nfor one who has faith, whose repentance is sincere, and who strives to work\nrighteous deeds.\nb)   By Allah’s pure grace, generosity, and favor. \nAllah may therefore forgive whomsoever He wills without that individual having\nactually repented.\nc)    By the performance of certain acts, like\nHajj\n,\naccording to some scholars.\nFate of a Person Who Dies Committing Major Sins\nA person who dies from an unrepented major sin is at\nAllah’s discretion in the Hereafter.  If Allah wants, He may punish him first acc"

Despair not of the mercy of Allah, indeed, Allah forgives\nall sins.  Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’” (Quran 39:53)\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and\nforgives sins” (Quran 42:25)\n2.  Praying for forgiveness\nAsking for forgiveness is not tied to strict conditions\nlike repentance.  It is simply a prayer that Allah may or may not accept.  The\nProphet said:\n“If a person commits a sin, then says, ‘O Lord, I have\ncommitted a sin so forgive me,’ He says, ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who\nmay forgive sins or punish for it; I have forgiven My slave…’”\n[1]\n3.  Doing good deeds which wipe out sins\nAllah says:\n“Indeed, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.” (Quran 11:114)\n·Daily Prayers and Friday Prayer\n“Each of the five daily prayers and from one Friday\nprayer to the next is an expiation for the time in between, so long as one does\nnot commit any major sin.”\n[2]\n·Ablution\n“When a Muslim, or a believer, washes his face (in\nthe course of ablution), every sin which he committed with his eyes, will be\nwashed away from his face with water, or with the last drop of water; when he\nwashes his hands, every sin which is committed by his hands will be effaced\nfrom his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when he\nwashes his feet, every sin his feet committed will be washed away with the\nwater, or with the last drop of water; until he finally emerges cleansed of all\nhis sins.”\n[3]\n·Fasting\nRamadan\n“Whoever fasts\nRamadan\nout of faith and the\nhope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.”\n[4]\n“Whoever spends the night of\nLaylat al-Qadr\nin prayer out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be\nforgiven.”\n[5]\n·\nHajj\n“Whoever performs Pilgrimage to this House, and\ndoes not engage in sexual relations with his wife during it and does not engage\nin sinful behavior will go back free of sin like the day his mother gave birth\nto him.”\n[6]\nRighteous deeds such as prayer, fasting,\nHajj\n,\netc only expiate for transgressions against the rights of Allah.  With regard\nto sins that have to do with the rights of other people, one has to repent from\nthem.\n4.  Prayers of fellow believers such as the funeral prayer\nThe Messenger of Allah said:\n“There is no Muslim man\nwho dies, and forty men pray the funeral prayer for him, not associating\nanything with Allah, but Allah will accept their intercession for him.”\n[7]\nAngels also pray for the believer:\n“Those who bear the Throne, and those who are around it,\nglorify their Lord with His praise, and believe in Him.  They ask forgiveness\nfor those who believe, saying, Our Lord, You embrace all things in mercy and\nknowledge.  Forgive those who turn to You and follow Your path.  Save them from\nthe punishment of Hell.” (Quran 40:7)\n5.  Intercession of the Prophet on the Day of Resurrection\nThe Prophet said:\n“My intercession will be for those among my\nummah\nwho committed major sins.”\n[8]\nAnd he said:\n“I was given the choice between admitting half of\nmy\nummah\nto Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession.”\n[9]\n6.  Allah wipes out sins by calamities of this world\nThe Prophet said:\n“No tiredness, exhaustion, worry,\ngrief, distress or harm befalls a believer in this world, not even a thorn that\npricks him, but Allah expiates some of his sins thereby.”\n[10]\n7.  The torment, squeezing, and terror of the grave will also\nexpiate sins.\n8.  Undergoing the horrors, distress and hardship of the Day\nof Resurrection will expiate some sins.\n9.  Mercy of the Most Merciful\nBy the mercy of Allah, with no cause on the part of\nHis slaves, many will be forgiven.\n[11]\nUnforgivable Sin\nIf a person dies as a\nkafir\nhe will not be\nforgiven."

The desire to achieve\n Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all\nother desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on\nwealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of\nmaking it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of\ndevotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on\npleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One\nmust remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.\nTo be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams\nand realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!\nUltimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate\ngoal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. \nParadise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of\nGod, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence\nof pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is\nan abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel\nthe least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally\nrealized.\nIslamic Gardens\nJannah\n(a\nbeautiful garden) has historically inspired beauty, something which ca"

It describes a state of awareness of Allah in everything one\ndoes.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\nRemembrance of Allah\nAlmost every person in the\nmodern world is involved in some basic worldly activity like earning a living,\ngoing to school, eating, sleeping, and socializing.  Naturally, we forget Allah\nand the obligations due to Him.  When we forget Allah, this life and its\nworries become the central occupation of the human mind.  Desires run wild.  A\nperson begins to ‘chase his shadow’, something he can never catch.  For many,\nmoney becomes the sole goal of life.  The more you make, the more you spend,\nthe more you want.\nAllah has set times to break\nregularly from the daily chores of life for a few minutes and worship Him.  First\nthing in the morning before we begin our day, in the middle of the day, in the\nlate afternoon, in the evening, and at night before we go to sleep.  When done\nwith concentration and properly, it awakens and stimulates the soul.  A Muslim\nreminds himself that Allah is in charge of everything, he is Allah’s faithful\nservant, and Allah’s pleasure is His aim.  For a few minutes, five times a day,\na Muslim leaves this world and meets  His Lord:\n“And establish the prayers (\nsalah\n)\nin order to remember Me.” (Quran 20:14)\nTaqwa\n(God-consciousness)\nThe prayers (\nsalah\n) also\nmakes a person God-conscious.  When a person prays five times a day, he becomes\naccustomed to feeling the presence of God and develops the sense that Allah is watching\nHim at all times.  He is never hidden from Allah, even when alone.  A sense of\nGod-consciousness keeps the heart suspended between fear and hope.  Fear of\nAllah keeps a Muslim away from the prohibited and encourages him to do the\nobligatory; a mix of divine love and devout reverence that keeps him\nreligiously observant. Regular performance of the prayers increases one’s awareness\nof Allah.\nSeeking Forgiveness\nTo err is human, and even the\nmost pious of Muslims sin and need to repent.  We all need to constantly ask\nfor Allah’s forgiveness and try our best not to repeat our mistakes.  Without\nregular contact with Allah, a person is unlikely to feel guilty for his sins\nand repent.  Sometimes if a person has not asked Allah to forgive him in a long\ntime, he might become insensitive to sinning and may even forget that he fell\ninto it, thus not even seeking forgiveness for it.  Certain prayers in the formal\nprayers (\nsalah\n) reminds the Muslim of his sins and makes him seek\nforgiveness for them  This in turn causes Muslims to feel guilty for their sins\nand seek repentance as soon as they are committed. A Muslim learns to constantly\nseeks forgiveness for his sins and never feels too distant from his loving Lord.  \nThe prayer places man directly before Allah seeking pardon for his short-comings.\nThe prayer itself is a means of\nerasing sins, albeit the lesser ones\n[1]\n.\nMessenger of Allah, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked:\n“What do you think if\nthere was a river by the door of any one of you and he bathed in it five times\na day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?”\nThey (his companions) said,\n“No trace of dirt would be left on him.”\nThe Prophet said, “This is\nlike the five daily prayers, through which Allah erases sin.” (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nControl and Discipline\nThe prayer has the capacity to\ncatalyze change for the better in people’s life.  The fact that we give up\nwhatever we are doing and line up behind a prayer leader (called\nimam\n) five\ntimes a day in the mosque, or find room to pray in at work or school by\nourselves, instills discipline in life.  People join the army to learn\ndiscipline and everyone admires it.  Similarly, the prayer trains us to go\nthrough specific motions and utter special words at specific times.  All the\nbody parts are under control, obeying and worshipping Allah, and if this\ndiscipline is broken, the prayer may have to be repeated.\nIslam recognizes that we are all\ndifferent, so it allows flexibility in many cases.  The prayer leader (\nimam\n)\nshould keep the prayer short.  Women are not required to attend the prayers in\nthe mosque.  A sick person may pray sitting, and if unable, he may even pray\nlaying down.  The discipline learned in the prayer is to be acquired in other\naspects of one’s religious and mundane life as well.  Just as we should not\nlook around when praying, we should control our eyes outside of the prayer not\nto fall on forbidden objects.  Just like we use our tongue to prai"

Those and\nother similar questions have been asked by people as long\nas human life has existed.  It is expressed by someone, somewhere all the time. \nIt is expressed in many different forms, such as What should I do?,\nWhy are we here?, What is life all about?, and\nWhat is the purpose of existence? and even Does life exist at\nall?  In the great scheme of things Muslims are in a very privileged position\nbecause when these existential questions pop into our minds we are able to\ncomprehend the answer.\nThe reason that we (humankind) are here, on this tiny\nplanet spinning in a seemingly infinite universe, is to worship Allah and Allah\nAlone.   This is the purpose for which we were created.  It is not a secret or\na mystery nor is it an enigma or a puzzle.   Finding the meaning of life is\npossible with only one thing, a desire to fulfil Allah’s plan.  There is no\nneed for hours or months or years of searching and yearning.\n“And I (Allah) created not the\njinn\nand humankind,\nexcept to worship Me (Alone).” (Quran 51:56)\n“Oh humankind, worship Allah, you have no other Allah but\nHim.” (Quran 7:59)\nHowever it is important to understand that Allah is not\nin need of human worship.  If not a single human worshipped Allah, it would not\ndiminish His glory in any way, and if all of humankind worshipped Him, it would\nnot increase His glory in any way.\n[1]\n“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes\nyou, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let\nbelievers put their trust. (Quran 3:160)\nO humankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but\nAllah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise. (Quran\n35:15)\nBecause we are fragile humans we need the comfort and\nsecurity of worshipping Allah.  In addition to that we will not find true\nhappiness and contentment until we at the very least attempt to fulfil our\npurpose in life.  The purpose of our existence is more meaningful than being\nslaves to the\ndunya\n.  Allah states that the reality of this\ndunya\nis full of deception and warns us not to fall for its temporary enjoyments.  We\nshould focus on our purpose in life in order to secure our place in the\nAkhirah.\nIn a\nhadith\nProphet Muhammad tells us that,\n“Allah says, 'Son of Adam, fill your time with my worship and I will fill your\nheart with richness, and end your poverty.  But if you do not, I will make your\nhands busy (in\ndunya\naffairs) and I would not end your poverty.’”\n[2]\nThe religion of Islam explains our purpose plainly,\nwhilst giving us clear guidelines to follow in order to make our worship easier\nand more fulfilling.  Everything is explained in the Quran and the\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad.  They are our guide books for a life full of purpose and\ncontentment.    They are the only means to true happiness but this however does\nnot mean that we will not be tried and tested.   Allah states very clearly in\nQuran that He will test us.\n“He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of\nyou is best in deed...” (Quran 67:1-2)\nOf course the life of a human being can be filled with\nplay and pleasure, but this is not the purpose of our lives.  Allah says in the\nQuran that we were indeed created for a purpose beyond that of mere delight and\nenjoyment.  The reality of life is that we will be resurrected to account for\nevery detail of our lives.\n“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any\npurpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?” (Quran 23:115)\nOne of the easiest ways to have the best of everything\nis to worship Allah in everything that we do.  Islam makes this easy.  It is as\nsimple as following the guidelines set out for us.  To remember Allah at every\nopportunity and to conduct our lives knowing that Allah is watching us, and\nangels are recording our every move.  By worshipping Allah we are doing ourselves\na favour.  When we are God-conscious we act in an upright manner and stay away\nfrom being evil and oppressing others.  And we also know that the laws of Islam\nare designe"

True justice should\nestablish an equilibrium by way of fulfilling rights and obligations and by\neliminating excess and disparity in all spheres of life.  The standard of\njustice in the Quran is referred to in some fifty passages.  People are urged\nto be just to others at all levels, whether personal or public, in words or in\nconduct, in dealing with friends or enemies, Muslim or non-Muslim, all must be\ntreated with justice.  Allah says in the Quran,\n“We sent Our messengers with evidences and revealed the Book\nand the balance through them so as to establish justice among people…” (Quran\n57:25)\n6.\nShari"

translates to Companions.   A\nsahabi\n, as the word is commonly used\ntoday, is someone who saw Prophet Muhammad, believed in him and died as a\nMuslim.\n·\nKabah\n- The cube-shaped\nstructure located in the city of Mecca.   It serves as a focal point towards\nwhich all Muslims face when praying.\n·\nHajj\n- A pilgrimage to Mecca where\nthe pilgrim performs a set of rituals.   The\nHajj\nis one of the five\npillars of Islam, which every adult Muslim must undertake at least once in\ntheir life if they can afford it and are physically able.\n·\nQiblah\n- The direction one faces\nduring the formal prayers.\nOne of the\nsahabah\nonce asked Prophet Muhammad\nwhich was the first\nmasjid\nbuilt on earth.  He replied, “The Sacred Mosque\nin Mecca”.  “Which was next?” the\nsahabi\nasked and the Prophet replied “Al-Aqsa\nMosque in Jerusalem”.\n[1]\nProphet Muhammad advised his followers not to prepare\nfor a religious journey except to three mosques.\n[2]\nThese three mosques are the three holiest sites in Islam\nand are situated in three sacred cities, Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.  All\nthree cities are in the Middle East, two in present day Saudi Arabia and the\nother in the Holy Land, now known as either Palestine or Israel.  In two\nlessons we will look closely at the significance of the three cities and\ndiscuss what they mean to Muslims around the globe.\nMecca\nMecca is home to the largest\nmasjid\nin the world,\nMasjid Al-Haraam\n(The Sacred Mosque).  It surrounds the\nKabah\n, a\ncube shaped structure that Muslims believe is the world’s first house of\nworship.  In the 21\nst\ncentury the\nmasjid\nhas a large outdoor\nterrace with white marble floors that reflect the bright light during the day\nand are floodlit at night.   It is a huge space that allows for the influx of\nup to 4 million people in the\nHajj\nseason.  It is a space that is always\nawake and where people from all over the globe congregate to spend their days\nand nights in worship and contemplation.   Mecca nowadays is a far cry from its\nhumble beginnings.\nThe area in which Mecca stands has been the subjects of stories\nstretching back to the very beginning of time.  Both the Quran and the Bible\nmention Mecca’s earlier name of Becca as a place of worship.  “…Blessed are\nthose whose strength is in You who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.  As\nthey pass through the valley of Becca, they make it a place of springs…”\n[3]\n“Verily the first house of worship appointed for mankind was\nat Becca…” (Quran 3:96)\nThe first Muslims prayed towards MasjidAl-Aqsa in\nJerusalem.   While in exile in Medina Prophet Muhammad received a revelation\nfrom God instructing him to turn towards the\nKabah\n.   Thus it became the\nqibla\nfor Muslims throughout the world.  The historians and scholars of\nIslam have differed on who built the\nKabah\n.  Some say that it was built\nby the angels.   Others say the father of humankind, Adam built the\nKabah\nbut over many centuries it fell into disrepair only to be rebuilt by Prophet\nIbrahim and his son Ishmael.   All agree that the\nKabah\nwas either built\nor rebuilt by Prophet Ibrahim.\n“And remember when Ibrahim and his son were raising the\nfoundations of the House (the\nKabah\nat Mecca), (saying), ‘Our Lord!\nAccept this service from us.  Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower’”\n(Quran 2:127)\nProphet Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in 570\nBCE.  At that time Mecca was an oasis on the trade routes between Yemen and the\nMediterranean Sea.  There is historical evidence indicating that goods from all\nover the known world flowed through the markets of Mecca.   And pilgrims used\nto come to visit the\nKabah.\nAt that historical point in time, it was filled\nwith statues and idols.\nEach year pilgrims travelled to Mecca and Prophet Muhammad’s\ntribe, the Quraish\n[4]\n,\nmade a very good living by trading with the pilgrims.  Muhammad’s prophethood\nput their very lucrative livelihoods into jeopardy and this was one of a\ncomplex myriad of reasons why they wrought havoc upon the Muslims and\neventually drove them from the city.\nProphet Muhammad once said of Mecca, “By Allah, you are\nthe best and the dearest of all lands of Allah to Him.  Had I not been driven\nout of you, I would have never left you.”\n[5]\nAnd, he once observed, “Allah, not the people, has made Mecca a sanctuary;\ntherefore, any person who believes in Allah and the Last Day should neither\nshed blood in it nor cut down its trees.”\n[6]\nWhen Prophet Muhammad returned to Mecca he took control\nof the city with great diplomacy, and with boundless mercy towards its\ninhabitants.  He purged the\nKabah\nof idols and the Arabian Peninsula of\nany worship except to Allah.   Mecca took its place in history as the spiritual\ncentre of Islam.\nMedina\nMedina, also in present day Saudi Arabia, is\nthe second most sacred city in Islam.  Its importance derives from the

It serves as a focal point towards which all\nMuslims face when praying.\nMedina (\ncontinued\n)\nThe second most sacred city in Islam is Medina. It\nis in the western region of Saudi Arabia in the area known as the Hejaz. Medina\nis the Arabic word for city and it is known as “the city” meaning it is the\ncity of Prophet Muhammad. It is also sometimes known as Medina Munawwarah\nmeaning the city of enlightenment.  Originally called Yathrib, Medina is the\ncity to which Prophet Muhammad and the fledgling Muslim community migrated when\nlife became too difficult in Mecca.\nThe original Prophet's Mosque was an open-air\nbuilding with a raised platform for sermons. It was a square enclosure of approximately\n30 by 35 meters and was built from palm trunks with mud walls. It could be accessed\nthrough three doors and its basic plan has since been adopted in the building\nof many other mosques throughout the world.\nThe\nMasjid\nalso contained a shaded area to the south\nand a prayer area facing north towards Jerusalem. When the\nqiblah\nwas\nchanged to Mecca, the\nMasjid\nwas re-oriented to face Mecca. This space\nalso served as a community centre, court, and school. In only seven years the\nMasjid\nspace was doubled to accommodate the ever increasing number of Muslims.\nIt is here in the\nMasjid\nthat the tomb of Prophet\nMuhammad is located. Because prophets are generally buried where they die,\nProphet Muhammad was buried in the home of his wife Aisha. This was originally\nattached to the\nMasjid\nbut in the intervening centuries the\nMasjid\nhas expanded to such a degree that even the cemetery known as Al-Baqi, once on\nthe outside of the city, now marks the outer precincts of the\nMasjid\n.  The\ngraves of some of Prophet Muhammad’s family members and many\nsahabah\nand\nearly generations of scholars can be found here.\nOne of the most significant and important reasons why\nMuslims all over the world long to visit this city filled with light and\nlearning is the fact that it has many blessings.\nThe person who offers 40 prayers consecutively in\nmy\nMasjid\n, without missing a prayer in between, will secure immunity\nfrom the fire of Hell and other torments and also from hypocrisy.\n[1]\nProphet Muhammad said, I was ordered to migrate to\na town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that\nis Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities\nof iron.” And he also said, There are angels guarding the entrances (or\nroads) of Medina, neither plague nor\nthe Dajjaal\n(Antichrist) will be\nable to enter it.”\n[2]\nMedina and its surrounds are filled with the places and\nsights that are infused with Islamic history. The site of the Battle of Badr is\napproximately 20 miles south west of Medina, and four miles north is the site\nof the Battle of Uhud. Also within a short distance is the place where the Battle\nof the Ditch was fought.  Masjid Al-Quba the first mosque built  in Islam and\nwhose foundation stone was laid by Prophet Muhammad himself can be found here\nin Medina, so too is Masjid Al-Qiblatain, the mosque built on the  site where\nthe revelation  to change the\nqiblah\ndirection came. Before this\nrevelation the first Muslims prayed facing towards Jerusalem.\nJerusalem\nThe city of Jerusalem is the third most sacred site in\nIslam. According to Islamic history, Prophet Jacob, built a\nmasjid\non\nthe Al-Aqsa site approximately 40 years after his grandfather Prophet Abraham\nbuilt the\nKabah\nin Mecca. It was later rebuilt or expanded by King\nSolomon, a man considered by Islam to also be a Prophet.\nGlorified be He Who took His slave on a journey by night from Masjid\nAl-Haraam to Masjid Al-Aqsa, the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in\norder that We might show him of Our signs.  Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the\nAll-Seer. (Quran 17:1)\nMuslims are much attached to Jerusalem because God\nrefers to it in the Quran as “the neighbourhood whereof we have blessed”.  A compound\ncalled Masjid Al-Aqsa lies within the city of Jerusalem.  The name Al-Aqsa translates\nto the farthest\nmasjid\n. However there are multiple mosques and centres\nof learning on the 144,000 square metre site including the most identifiable\nbuilding in Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock.\nThe golden shining dome stands out on the Jerusalem\nskyline and can be recognized by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. In an event\nknown as the Night Journey and Ascension, Prophet Muhammad ascended to the\nlowest heaven from a rock that is now found inside this most famous symbol.  On\nthe same journey Prophet Muh"

Through the belief and attestation of these two phrases one enters\nthe fold of Islam. It is the central belief that a believer maintains\nthroughout his life, and is the basis for all his beliefs, worship and existence\nin this world.\nEvery Muslim, including someone new to Islam, has to\nunderstand the meanings of these two phrases, and try to live his life\naccordingly.\nThe Importance of the Testimony of\nFaith\nThis Testimony is by far the most important aspect of\nthe religion of Islam, upon which the whole religion is built. Islam is the\nonly true monotheistic religion, stressing that no worship should be directed\nto any other except Allah. It is a way of life in which a person obeys and\nworships the orders of Allah and none else.\nThis Testimony of Faith (\nShahadah\n) reminds us of\nour purpose in life, which is the worship of Allah alone.  Allah says in the\nQuran:\n“And I have not created neither jinn nor humans, except to\nworship Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)\nThe message of the Oneness of God (\nTawheed\n) found\nin the Testimony was not particular to the message of Prophet Muhammad, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. It was the universal message of all\nProphets of Allah. Since the dawn of humanity, Allah sent Messengers to every\npeople and nation, commanding them to worship Him Alone, and to reject all\nfalse deities. Allah says:\n“And indeed We have raised amongst every nation a Messenger,\n[commanding them] ‘Worship Allah, and reject all false deities.” (Quran 16:36)\nThe Meaning of\nLa ilaha illa Allah\nThe meaning of each word in the\nphrase is:\nLa\n: There is no;\nilaha\n:\ngod (deity);\nilla\n: except;\nAllah\n: Allah (God)\nAnd therefore the literal\nmeaning of this phrase is “There is no god (deity) except Allah”\nFirst Part of this phrase: Rejection\n‘There is no god (deity)’… Here, god with a small case\n‘g’ is anything which is worshipped. Many people have taken things in creation\nas their gods and deities, but they are all false and are wrongfully worshipped,\nmeaning that they have no right to that worship, nor do they deserve it. This\nrejection extends to all superstitions, ideologies, ways of life, or any\nauthority figures who claim divine devotion.\nSome people imagine the Divine Kingdom of God to be like\nearthly kingdoms. Just as a king has many ministers and trusted associates,\nthey imagine ‘saints’ and minor deities to be our intercessors to God.  They\ntake them as agents through whom God is approached. In truth, there are no\nintercessors in Islam, nor any class of clergy to whom one must ‘confess’ their\nsins to be forgiven. A Muslim prays directly and exclusively to God. We also\nreject superstitious practices such as astrology, palm reading, good luck\ncharms, and fortune-telling.\nSecond Part of this phrase: Affirmation\n‘Except Allah’… After denying the right of any created\nbeing to be worshipped, the Testimony affirms divinity for Allah alone, with ‘…\nexcept\nAllah.’\nAllah, in the Quran, mentions in many places that all\nthings which people take as objects of worship besides Allah do not deserve any\nworship, nor do they have any right over it, as they themselves are creations\nand have no power to bring any benefit.\nYet they have taken besides Him other gods that created\nnothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for\nthemselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor\nof raising the dead. (Quran 25:3)\nThus,\nla ilaha illa Allah\nmeans, “There is no\ntrue\ngod except Allah” or “There is no god rightfully worshipped except Allah.”\nThe Meaning of\nMuhammad rasoolu Allah\nThe meaning of each word in the\nphrase is:\nMuhammad\n: Prophet\nMuhammad;\nrasoolu\n: Messenger;\nAllah\n: Allah (God)\nAnd therefore this phrase means,\n“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”.\nBy testifying to this fact, one affirms that Prophet\nMuhammad is in fact a Prophet and Messenger raised by God, amongst mankind to\ndeliver the message of God, as were other Prophets and Messengers. Attesting to\nthis fact implies a multitude of meanings. These include:\n1.  To believe\nthat he was the\nlast\nProphet and Messenger.\n“Muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the\nMessenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets and Allah is Ever All-Aware of\neverything” (Quran 33:40)\n2. To believe\nthat he delivered the message of Allah faithfully just as he r"

the types of\nshirk\n.\n·To learn\nshirk\nin Allah’s:\noLordship.\noNames & Attributes.\nArabic Terms\n·\nShirk\n- a word that implies ascribing\npartners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or\nbelieving that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another\nbesides Allah.\n·\nTawheed\n- The Oneness and Uniqueness\nof Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and in His\nright to be worshipped.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas several\nmeanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally\naccepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.\nIntroduction\nThe Arabic word\nshirk\n[1]\nis the opposite of\ntawheed\n, Allah’s oneness and uniqueness, and is more\ninclusive than polytheism and idolatry.\nShirk\ncontradicts the very\npurpose of creation as expressed in the Quran:\n“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship Me.”\n(Quran 51:56)\nProphets were sent with the mission to eradicate\nshirk\nand to invite humanity to single out Allah in worship.\nWhat is\nShirk\n?\nShirk\nis to associate someone other than Allah in\nthose aspects which are unique to Allah and His exclusive right.\nShirk\nis to worship created beings like Allah is worshipped, to venerate created\nbeings like Allah must be venerated, and to assign a portion of His divinity to\nsomeone else.\nSeverity of\nShirk\nThere is no issue upon which Islam is so strict as the\none of\ntawheed\n(monotheism).  Therefore,\nshirk\nis considered the\ngreatest\nviolation with which the Lord of the heavens and the earth is defied.  The\nseverity of\nshirk\ncan be summarized in the following points:\n(1)\nShirk\nmakes the Creator like His\ncreation, in that matters that are exclusive to Allah are associated with\nothers who have no right to it.  Therefore, Allah declares\nshirk\nto be\nthe greatest wrong,\n“Indeed to ascribe partners (unto Him) is a tremendous wrong.”\n(Quran 31:13)\n(2)  Allah has declared that He will not forgive\nthe sin of\nshirk\nunless the person repents from it,\n“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner should be set up\nwith Him, and forgives all besides that to whom He pleases.” (Quran 4:48)\n(3)  Allah has forbidden Paradise to those who do\nnot repent from committing\nshirk\n, condemning him to Hell for eternity,\n“Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has\nforbidden to him Paradise and his abode is the Fire.” (Quran 5:72)\n(3)  All the good works a person may have done are\nlost, become worthless, and are rendered vain if a person dies unrepentant of\nshirk\n,\n“And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those\nbefore you: if you should associate (anything) with Allah, your work would\nsurely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Quran\n39:65)\n(4)\nShirk\nis the deadliest of all major\nsins.  On one occasion, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, asked his companions if they knew what was greatest of all major sins. \nHe then explained to them,\n“The major sins are:\nshirk\n, not being kind\nto one’s parents…” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nTypes of Shirk\n(1)  Greater\nShirk\n(\nShirk\nAkbar)\n(2)  Lesser\nShirk\n(\nShirk\nAsghar)\nDefinition of Greater\nShirk\nGreater\nShirk\nis associating others with Allah in\nthose aspects which are unique to Allah in his person taking a rival or associate\nunto Allah and making it an equal to Allah.\nShirk\nin Allah Being the Lord\nThis category includes:\n(i)   Atheism (the belief that human beings have no\nLord).\nPharaoh denied the existence of Allah and claimed his\nown self to be the Lord over Moses and the people of Egypt.  He announced to\npeople:\n“I am your Lord, Most High.” (Quran 79:24)\nModern day philosophers that deny the existence of Allah\nor scientists who consider the universe created itself or has no beginning or\nend fall under this category.  Also, the idea that nature itself is God, or\nthat God dwells within His creation is also\nshirk\n.\n(b)  The belief that Allah shares His rule and\ncontrol over the creation.\nPeople who fall into this category are those who may believe\nin Allah’s powers and abilities, but also believe that Allah is several\n“persons,” that He is somehow “split” into different beings.  An example is\nChristians who believe that Allah is God the Father, God the Son, and God the\nHoly Spirit, all at the same time.  Also, Hindus believe in One God who takes\nthe forms of Brahma – the creator-god, Vishnu – the preserver-god, and Shiva –\nthe destroyer-god.  Islam teaches that Allah is One in every sense: perfect,\nindivisible, and complete.\nAnother example of this\nshirk\nis held by people\nwho pray to the dead.  They believe the souls of the saints and other people\ncan meddle in the affairs of mortal men, that somehow the departed souls can\ncause change in the life of men and women by answering their prayers or in\nother ways.  The truth"

A Muslim should not be\nattached to anything else to a level where it enslaves his heart.  Hearts get attached\nto power, money, glamour, women, music, drugs, and alcohol, to name a few.  These\nthings can become the ‘god’ in one’s life who a person chases day and night,\nand, once he gets the thing he loves, he works hard to please it.  That is why\nthe Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said a man who\nworships money will always be miserable\n[1]\nand\nthe Quran says,\n“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides\nAllah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But those who\nbelieve love Allah (more than anything else).” (Quran 2:165)\n(2)\nShirk\nin supplication.  First, supplication\nor invocation (known as\ndu’a\nin Arabic) is part of worship as the\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“Supplication is the essence of worship.” (\nAbu\nDaud, Al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad\n)\nCalling upon dead saints, righteous men or those who are\nabsent and far away for help and assistance as Allah should have been prayed to\nis greater\nshirk\n.  It includes praying, invoking or supplicating to a\nfalse deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides Allah.  Christians\npray to a man, the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, whom they claim to have been God\nincarnate.  Catholics pray to saints, angels, and Mary as the “mother of God.”  It\nis also\nshirk\nto pray to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings\nof Allah be upon him, or to deceased holy men believing that they can answer prayers,\nas Allah says,\n“Say: ‘Behold, I have been forbidden to worship those whom you\ninvoke instead of Allah.’” (Quran 6:56)\n“And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits\nyou nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.”\n(Quran 10:106)\n“If you pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they\nheard they could not grant it you.  On the Day of Resurrection they will disown\nassociation with you.  None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.” (Quran 35:14)\n(3)\nShirk\nin obedience.  Allah is the only\nRuler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver\n[2]\n,\nthe Absolute Judge, and the Legislator.  He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just\nlike the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the\nmoral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from\nwrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,\ndetermine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human\ninteraction and behavior.  His is the command:\n“His is the Creation and Command.” (7:54)\n“Legislation is not but for Allah.  He has commanded that you\nworship not except Him.  That is the correct religion, but most of the people\ndo not know.” (Quran 12:40)\nObeying religious leaders in matters of clear\ndisobedience to Allah is a form of greater\nshirk\nas Allah says:\n“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and\ntheir monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)\nThey made partners unto Allah not by directly praying to\nthem, but by willfully accepting their rabbis and clergy changing the lawful\ninto prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave\ntheir religious men the authority only Allah has - to set the divine law.  For\nexample, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church has the authority to determine\nhow God is t"

Thus the word\nriyaa\nmeans showing\noff, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically\nriyaa\nmeans to perform\nacts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than\nAllah.\nDefinition of Lesser\nShirk\nLesser\nShirk\nis what has been specifically called\nshirk\nin the Quran and\nSunnah\n, but does not reach the level of greater\nshirk\n.  \nAlso, lesser\nshirk\nis said to lead to greater\nshirk\n.   Some\nscholars have said lesser\nshirk\nis so vast that it is difficult to\ndefine it precisely.   The most important examples of lesser\nshirk\nare:\nCharms & Omens\nWearing charms, talismans, and amulets for protection\nagainst the evil eye, bad luck and the like thinking that Allah has placed\nthese powers in them constitute lesser\nshirk\n.  This is discussed in more\ndetail\nhere\n.\nSwearing an Oath in the Name of Other than Allah\nTaking an oath, or swearing, in the name of someone\nother than Allah is a type of lesser\nshirk\ngiven that a person does not\nintend to venerate the one in whose name the oath is being taken, else it turns\ninto greater\nshirk\n.   The Messenger of Allah, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said,\n“The one who takes an oath in the name of other\nthan Allah commits disbelief or\nshirk\n.”\n[1]\nRiyaa\n(Showing-Off)\nThe Messenger of Allah said:\n“The thing that I fear most for you is lesser\nshirk\n.”\nThey said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is lesser\nshirk\n?”\n He said:\n“\nRiyaa\n(showing off), for Allah will say on\nthe Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom\nyou were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find\nwith them.’” (\nAhmad\n)\nRiyaa\nis to perform worship in order to be seen\nand praised by people.\nRiyaa\nrenders a deed void; the person earns sin\ninstead of reward from Allah, and it exposes him to punishment.\nHuman beings, by nature like to be praised, are not fond\nof criticism, and do not like to be seen deficient in any way.   Islam views doing\nreligious acts to impress others instead of pleasing Allah - what should have\nbeen done for Allah is done for people - as\nshirk\n.   The Messenger of\nAllah said:\n“Allah (glorified and exalted be He) said: ‘I am so\nself-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate.  Thus he who does\nan action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action\nrenounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.’” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nThere is a good chance of a believer falling into\nriyaa\nbecause it is hidden, it sits in the heart, pollutes the intention, and a\nperson has to be extremely vigilant to correct it.  Ibn Abbas, one of the\nProphet’s companions, said,\n“\nShirk\nin the Muslim nation is more hidden\nthan a black ant crawling on a black stone in the middle of a moonless night.”\n[2]\nIntention is a simple matter, but sometimes changing it\ncan be difficult.   A person has to listen to their heart and see what motivates\na certain action.  A Muslim has to carefully watch his intention to keep it\npure whenever he performs a good deed like\nsalah\n(ritual prayer), giving\ncharity, fasting, serving his parents, or even smiling.  Perhaps this is why\nthe saying of Allah’s Name has been prescribed before all acts of importance in\ndaily life – eating, drinking, sleeping, going to the toilet, waking up, and\ngoing to sleep.  Remembering Allah keeps the heart aware of Allah and the\nintention pure.\nLet us understand with simple examples how\nriyaa\nmay affect worship:\n(a)  Let us say the basic motive when you stand up\nto pray is for people to see you, or notice you are praying, wishing to be praised. \nThis invalidates the act of worship.\n(b)  Let us say you started off to pray with\nsincerity, your intention was to pray for Allah, but then you started thinking\nabout pleasing people, and slowly your intention changed.  You do one of the\ntwo things.  If you resist the temptation of getting noticed, it will not have\nany effect on you because the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, said:\n“Allah has forgiven my ummah"

Allah.  Nothing else.  The\nProphet of Islam was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, where was our Lord before He\ncreated His creation?” He said: “Nothing existed but Him, with nothing beneath\nHim and nothing above Him.”\n[1]\nThink about how amazing that is, basically it tells us\nthat there is nothing but Allah that is truly worthy; creation needs Allah and\nnothing else because in the beginning there was Allah while there was nothing\nelse.\nAllah says in the Quran:\n“Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the Guardian\nover all things.” (Quran 39:62)\nSo everything besides Allah was created by Him, is under\nHis dominion and His disposal, and He brought it into existence.\nJubayr, a contemporary of Prophet Muhammad describes\nhimself, saying, “I was one of the greatest enemies of the Prophet,” and he\nsaid, “I hated him more than any other human being on the face of this earth,”\nbut then something strange happened.   “One time I walked into the mosque and I\nheard the Prophet reciting verses from\nSurah\nat-Toor (Quran 52:35-36),\n‘Were they created from absolutely nothing or are they themselves suggesting\nthat they are the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth?\nRather they have absolutely no idea, they are at confusion!’”\nJubayr says that at that moment when the Prophet said\nthat, even though he wouldn't officially accept Islam until later on in his life,\n“faith entered my heart.   I knew at that point that there is absolutely no way\nthat there is no God!”\nIf you just sit with yourself and you go through the\nprocess of elimination of the possibilities of how we and everything else\naround us is here, you will find that there is no other way to explain it\nexcept by Allah.\nCreation of Water and the Throne (\nArsh\n)\nProphet Muhammad said: “Nothing existed but Him,\nwith nothing beneath Him and nothing above Him.   Then He created His Throne\nabove the water.”\n[2]\nThe Prophet tells us that there was Allah first and\nnothing else.   Then, He created the water and the Throne (\nArsh\n).   They\nwere created independent of any angels and were created before the creation of the\nheavens and the earth.   Prophet Muhammad said, “There was Allah, and there was\nnothing else besides Him, and His Throne was over the wat0er.   He wrote all\nthings in the Book (in heaven) and He created the heavens and the eart0h.”\n[3]\nAll stars,\nplanets, galaxies comes under the “first heaven” (\nAs-sama ad-dunya\n).\nGod mentions many times in the Quran that He is the Lord\nof the Glorious Throne, because it is one of the foremost and most magnificent\nof his creations.\nDescription\nof the Throne\n1.  Allah Created His Throne Above Water\nAllah said, “\nAnd\nHe it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne\nwas on the water.”\n(Quran 11:7)\n2.  Throne is the Roof of Paradise\nThe Prophet said:\n“If you ask Allah, then ask him the (Paradise of)\nFirdaws\n,\nfor it is in the highest point of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the\nMost Merciful, and from it burst the rivers of Paradise.”\n[4]\n3.  Throne is Above the Heavens & Above\nAll Creation\nAbdullah Ibn Masud, a Companion of the\nProphet, said, “Between the lowest heaven and the one after it is the distance\nof five hundred years, and between every two heavens is the distance of five\nhundred years, and between the seventh heaven and the\nKursi\nis the\ndistance of five hundred years, and between the\nKursi\nand the water is\nthe distance of five hundred years, and the Throne (\nArsh\n) is above the\nwater.  Allah the Almighty is above the Throne.  And nothing is hidden from\nAllah of your deeds.”\n[5]\n4.  Throne has Pillars\nThe Prophet said:\n“The people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection\nand I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold, I will find Musa\nclinging to one of the pillars of the Throne.  Then I will not know whether he\nregained consciousness before me or he has been exempted because of his\nunconsciousness at the mountain of Toor (at Sinai).”\n[6]\n)\n5.  Angels Who Carry It\nAllah said:\n“Those\n(angels) who bear the Throne and those around it glorify the praises of their\nLord.”\n(Quran 40:7)\nHe also said:\n“And\nthe angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the\nThrone of your Lord above them.”\n(Quran 69:17)\nMoreover, Allah talks about the great angels that carry\nthe Throne.  They are huge magnificent creatures from the best of Allah’s\nangels.  On the Day of Judgement, Allah tells us there will be eight angels\nthat will bear His Throne (Quran 69:17).  The Prophet said, “I was permitted to\nspeak about one of the angels of Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, who is\none of the"

They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\nThe Pen\nAfter the creation of the water and the Throne, God\ncreated the Pen.  When the Prophet says that God created the Pen, he says that\nHis Throne was settled upon water, that there was a layer of water under the\nThrone of God.\n“God ordained the measures of the creation fifty thousand\nyears before He created the heavens and the earth while His Throne was over the\nwater.”\n[1]\nWhat are the dimensions of the Pen?  How does it look?  We\nhave absolutely no idea.\nThe Prophet said, “God said to the Pen: ‘Write.’ It\nsaid: ‘O Lord, what should I write?’ He said: ‘Write down the decrees of all\nthings until the Hour begins.’”\n[2]\nThe Preserved Tablet (\nAl-Lawh Al-Mahfuz\n)\nThe Pen, which was created 50,000 years before the\nheavens and the earth, wrote in what’s known as\nal-Lawh al-Mahfuz\n, the\nPreserved Tablet.  God calls it\nal-Lawh Al-Mahfuz\nbecause it’s protected\nfrom any changes and is also protected from access.  Everything is within that\nBook, even, as God tells us, a leaf falling from the tree.  Everything that\nwould have happened, that has happened, and will happen is written there.\nWhat it does is it establishes the trust of a believer\nin Allah that what He wrote was written for our good, and that everything\nhappens for a wisdom.  Sometimes we can figure it out, but at other times we\nare comforted and content knowing that God knows what He is doing.\nHeavens and Earth\nReferring to what scientists call the Big Bang today,\nthe Quran says,\n“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and\nthe earth were joined together as one piece, then We parted them and We have\nmade from water every living thing? Will they not then believe?”\n(Quran\n21:30)\nBased on the following verse, some scholars state that Allah\ncreated the heavens before He created the earth,\n“Are you more difficult to\ncreate or is the heaven that He constructed.  He raised its height, and has\nperfected it.  Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.  And after\nthat He spread the earth.  And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. \nAnd the mountains He has fixed firmly, as provision and benefit for you and\nyour cattle.”\n(Quran 79:27-30)\nAllah says in the Quran,\n“Indeed, your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the\nearth in six days.” (Quran 7:54)\nAllah really does not need six days, God could simply\nhave said, “Be,” and it would have come into existence.  Why would God create\nin six days as opposed to just one second or less? Perhaps, God wanted to teach\nus one of the beloved qualities to Him, which is to take things slowly and\nplanning them out properly.\nSeas, Rivers, & Rain\nAllah tells us that He is the One who created the\nheavens and the earth, sent down rain from the sky, producing fruits and\nsustenance for our survival.  Allah provided for us seas and ships to sail\nthrough these seas.  He put the rivers at our service and placed the sun and\nthe moon in their circuits.  He put for our service the night and the day.  Allah\nsays that He gave us everything that we need to survive.  If we were to try to\ncount the blessings of Allah, we would not be able to do so (see Quran\n14:32-34).\nThe earth benefits us in innumerable ways.   If you look\nat the surface of the earth, Allah says He made it special for us, meaning that\nit is ease to tread.  Now imagine if the surface of the earth was all like\nmountains and we all had to live in regions that were rough and difficult to\nwalk.  He made the surface soft so we can dig into it and plant things.  But at\nthe same time, He made the earth stable and firm enough to allow construction\nand building from its materials.  He also created gravity so we’re not just\nflying all over the place.\nSun & Moon\nThe sun is a magnificent creation of Allah and you will\nfind that Allah swears by the sun in Chapter Ash-Shams in order to bestow\ngreater appreciation for this gift that He gave us.  Many religions in the past\nassigned special qualities to the sun; a lot of people worshipped the sun.  Allah\nsays,\n“And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. \nDo not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostate to God, who created\nthem, if you [really] worship Him.” (Quran 41:37)\nWith the sun, moon, and the stars you have a lot of\nsuperstitions and even rational human beings will have these very strange\nsuperstitions.  People often put logic aside when it comes to superstitions. \nYou have astrology, horoscopes and other similar things that make absolutely no\nsense, but they give people either hope that’s not really there or they give\npeople a reason for t"

In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\nThe human mind is a true marvel, but in certain areas it\nis limited.  Allah is different from anything the human mind can think of or\nimagine.  Therefore, if the mind tries to picture Allah, certain aspects will\nbe ambiguous and open to indefinite interpretation.  Nevertheless, it is\npossible to understand the attributes of Allah which do not require making any\nmental pictures.  For example, one of Allah’s names is\nal-Ghaffar\n, which\nmeans ‘Oft-Forgiver’.  Everyone can understand this easily because that is how\nthe human mind can clearly think of Allah.  Jewish and Christian teachings on\nGod are confused partly because of their incorrect understanding of this issue. \nThe Jewish Torah teaches God is like man:\n“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image,\nafter our likeness…so God made man in His own image.’ (Genesis 1:26-27)\nMoreover, certain Christians put statues or images of an\nold white bearded man depicting God in their churches.  Some of these were  produced\nby the likes of Michelangelo, who depicted the Face and Hand ‘of God’ – a tough\nlooking old man - in paintings.\nRendering images of God in Islam is an impossibility,\nand amounts to disbelief, as Allah tells us in the Quran that nothing resembles\nHim:\n“There is nothing like Him, but He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.”\n(Quran 42:11)\n“There is nothing comparable to Him.” (Quran 112:4)\nThe Request of Moses to See Allah\nEyes can not grasp Allah, He tells us in the Quran:\n“Vision cannot grasp Him, but He his grasp is over all vision.”\n(Quran 6:103)\nMoses, to whom God spoke and gave great miracles, was\nchosen by Allah to be His Prophet.  It is said, that Moses thought that, since\nAllah used to speak to him, he might be able to actually see Allah if he asked. \nThe story is in the Quran, where Allah tells us what happened:\n“And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord\nspoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show me (Yourself) that I may look at You.’  (Allah)\nsaid, ‘You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in\nplace, then you will see Me.’  But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He\nrendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious.  And when he awoke, he said,\n‘Exalted are You!  I have repented to You, and I am the first of the\nbelievers.’” (Quran 7:143)\nAllah made it clear that no one, including the great\nprophet Moses, can bear the sight of the divine, for Allah is too great to be grasped\nby human eyes in this life.  According to the Quran, Moses realized his request\nwas in error; therefore, he sought forgiveness from Allah for having even\nthought to ask.\nThe Prophet Muhammad Did Not See Allah in This Life\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, traveled in a miraculous journey through the heavens to meet Allah. \nPeople thought that since Prophet Muhammad spoke to Allah in that journey, he\nprobably saw Allah too.  One of the companions, Abu Dharr, asked him about it. \nThe Prophet replied:\n“There was only light, how could I see Him?’\n[1]\nWhat was the light he saw?  The Prophet explained:\n“Surely, Allah does not sleep nor is it befitting\nfor Him to sleep.  He is the one who lowers the scales and raises them.  The\ndeeds of the night go up to Him before the deeds of the day and those of the\nday before those of the night, and His veil is the light.”\n[2]\nVision of God in Spiritual Experiences\nSome people, including some who claim to be Muslims,\nreport spiritual experiences where they have claimed to have seen God.  Common\nreported experiences also include seeing lights, or a magnificent being seated\non a throne.  Such an experience is usually accompanied by dropping basic\nIslamic practices like\nsalah\nand fasting, under the mistaken opinion\nthat such practices are only for common people who had not had their type of\nexperience.\nOne of the fundamental foundations of Islam is that the\nlaw revealed to Prophet Muhammad cannot be changed or canceled.  God neither\nmakes lawful for some what He has made unlawful for others, nor does He communicate\nHis Law thro"

So he came to Allah’s\nMessenger and told him the story, upon which the Messenger asked him to bring\nher.\nWhen\nshe came, the Prophet asked her,\n‘Where is Allah?’\nShe answered, ‘Above\nthe sky.’  The Prophet asked her,\n‘Who am I?’\nShe said, ‘You are the\nMessenger of Allah.’  He said,\n‘Free her, for she is a believer.’\n[1]\nHere, the Prophet affirmed her statement that Al"

He, the Exalted, says:\n“And We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), except as a mercy to\nthe worlds.” (Quran 21:107)\nProphet Muhammad was the embodiment of mercy.   He\nshowed gentleness and compassion to all those he came in contact with; his\nfamily, orphans, friends, slaves, and strangers.\n“And by the Mercy of God, you dealt with them gently.   And\nhad you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about\nyou; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah’s) Forgiveness for them...”\n(Quran 3:159)\n·The Quran\nThe Quran is Allah’s greatest gift to humanity – it is a\nbook like no other.  The Quran guides humankind to high standards of morality\nand exhorts them to strive to be the best human beings possible.   Whenever\nlife becomes too difficult or we are beset by injury, illness or unhappiness, the\nQuran will light our way and lighten our burdens.   It is a source of solace\nand ease.  It is a mercy to humankind.\n“And We have not sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (O\nMuhammad), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which\nthey differ, and (as) a guidance and a\nmercy\nfor a people who believe.”\n(Quran 16:64)\n“And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent\ndown, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e.  do not disobey His Orders), that you\nmay receive mercy.”(Quran 6:155)\n·Leniencies in matters of worship.\nIslam teaches that every\nsingle aspect of life can be an act of worship.  Everything from eating and\ndrinking to sleeping and going to the bathroom can be done in a way that\npleases Allah.\nIslam is a faith that is flexible, lenient and merciful.\nFor instance, if a believer is sick and cannot fast\nduring the month of Ramadan, he is not mandated to fast.  In fact he is\nencouraged to not fast.  Similarly if a Muslim cannot make the\nHajj\ndue\nto physical or financial difficulties he or"

all\nqualities that a Muslim is expected to cultivate in this life.  Because of this\nIslam places great emphasis on developing the qualities of compassion,\nsympathy, forgiveness, and love.   Both the Quran and the\nSunnah\nof\nProphet Muhammad display and encourage these ideals.  Allah blesses Muslims who\nare kind to others and dislikes behaviour that is hard hearted or cruel.  Consequently\nProphet Muhammad could often be heard invoking God’s Mercy on the believers.\nMercy & Forgiveness\nAllah’s mercy should never be underestimated and the qualities\nof mercy and forgiveness are linked together throughout the Quran and the\nauthentic traditions - the\nSunnah\n- of Prophet Muhammad.  Allah asks us\nto seek forgiveness from Him and Prophet Mohammad reminded us that God forgives\nwhen we turn to Him.   In the last part of the night, when darkness lies\nheavily across the land, God descends to the lowest heaven and asks His slaves. \n“Who is saying a prayer to Me that I may answer it?  Who is asking something of\nMe that I may give it to him?  Who is asking forgiveness of Me that I may\nforgive him?”\n[2]\n“Say, ‘O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves\n[by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah.  Indeed, Allah forgives all\nsins.  Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’ And return [in\nrepentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you;\nthen you will not be helped.” (Quran 39: 53 – 54)\nAllah created humankind with an inclination to commit\nsins and make mistakes, however when a person repents he or she is able to see\nand experience Allah’s divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness.  Prophet\nMuhammad said, “If you did not commit sins, Allah would wipe you out of\nexistence and replace with another people who would commit sins and in turn\nseek Allah’s forgiveness.\n[3]\nFalling into error, realizing the mistake, and seeking Allah’s forgiveness\nwhilst hoping for His mercy, is spiritual growth that develops a person’s love\nfor Allah.  Allah loves those who constantly turn to Him seeking forgiveness.\nAlthough Allah is eager for all human beings to turn to Him\nand ask forgiveness, and although His mercy is vast and all-encompassing, this\nis not a license to commit sins.  In order for a person to feel the mercy of\nAllah and be forgiven for his or her transgressions, the conditions of\nrepentance should be fulfilled\n[4]\n. \nThen and only then will the mercy of Allah descend.\nThe mercy of Allah is made manifest when Allah counts\nthe sin of the sinner as one sin.  It is further manifested when Allah rewards\nthe righteous person ten times what his good deed is worth and then Allah may multiply\nhis reward even more than ten times.  “Allah ordered (the appointed angels over\nyou) that the good and the bad deeds be written, and He then showed (the way)\nhow (to write).  If someone intends to do a good deed and he does not do it,\nthen Allah will write for him a full good deed; and if he intends to do a good\ndeed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him (its reward equal) from\nten to seven hundred times to many more times.  And If someone intends to do a\nbad deed and he does not do it, then Allah will write for him a full good deed\n(in his account) with Him, and if he intends to do a bad deed and actually did\nit, then Allah will write for him one bad deed.”\n[5]\nAlso, Allah erases sins with each good deed performed.\n“…Verily, the good\ndeeds r"

If the image was\ndistorted, it was taken as a sign of impending disaster. Thus the ‘unbreakable’\nmetal mirrors of the early Egyptians and Greeks were valued items because of\ntheir magical properties (such as possessing undistorted reflecting properties).\nAfter glass mirrors were introduced, the Romans took the broken mirror as a\nsign of bad luck, since each piece reflected and multiplied their ‘other self’.\nThe length of the prescribed misfortune came from the Roman belief that man's\nbody was physically rejuvenated every 7 years, and he became, in effect, a new\nman.\n(2) Knocking on wood: the ancient belief that\nspirits either dwelled in, or guarded trees.  Greeks worshipped the oak as it\nwas sacred to Zeus, Celts believed in tree spirits, and both believed touching\nsacred trees would bring good fortune.  Irish lore holds that ‘touching wood’ is\na way to thank the leprechauns for a bit of luck.  Pagans also held similar\nbeliefs of protective tree spirits.  Chinese and Koreans thought the spirits of\nmothers who died in childbirth remained in nearby trees.  Another explanation\npoints to the wooden Christian cross as the origin of  ‘good luck,’ although\nthis is likely a Christian adaptation of earlier pagan practices.\n(3)  The inadvertent spilling of salt is believed\nto be followed by misfortune, so it is deliberately spilled, or cast, over the\nleft shoulder to counter it.  Superstitions about salt date back to biblical\ntimes when salt was a highly prized commodity.  It was expensive, crucial in\npreserving food, and was often used in place of currency.  So spilling salt was\nconsidered an almost sacrilegious offence, and left one exposed to the devil's\nmachinations.  Throwing salt over your shoulder is thought to be a way of\nkeeping the devil at bay while you are in especially vulnerable.  The salt is\neither intended to blind the devil so he can not witness your error, or keep\nhim from sneaking up on you while you are cleaning up the mess.\n(4)  Friday 13\nth\n: Western culture has\nconsidered Friday 13th particularly unlucky for hundreds of years.  The 13\nth\nfloor in many high-rise buildings in America is called the 14\nth\nfloor.  The sixth day of the week has often been considered unlucky, as has the\nnumber 13.  The combination, which occurs one to three times a year, leads inevitably\nto this reinforced superstition.\nPeople\navoid traveling on this day. Some say the number 13 was purposely vilified by\nthe priests of patriarchal religions because it represented femininity.  Thirteen\ncorresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year, and the\nnumber was revered in prehistoric goddess-worshipping cultures.  Hindus\nbelieved that it was unlucky for 13 people to gather in one place.  This\nconviction was shared by the ancient Scandinavians.  Many biblical events of\nnegative import supposedly occurred on a Friday, including the ejection of Adam\nand Eve from the Garden of Eden, the start of the Great Flood, and the purported\ncrucifixion of Jesus.\nIslamic Ruling on Omens\nBefore Islam the Arabs used to consider the direction in\nwhich birds flew to be a sign of good or bad omen.  If a person set out on a\njourney and saw a bird fly over"

the\nKingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs exclusively to Him, and He owns them. \nHe alone brought existence out of non-existence and it depends on Him for its\nconservation and continuance.  His power is required at every moment to sustain\nall creatures.  Angels, prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant\nkingdoms are under His control.  Only Allah knows what the future holds.  Good\nluck and bad fortune are from Allah alone.\nFaith in charms, amulets, and talismans contradict\nbelief in Allah’s Lordship by attributing the ability to bring good luck or\navert bad fortune to these created brings whereas only Allah can bring good and\navert harm.  Consequently, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, opposed these superstitious practices and taught people to have firm\nbelief in their Lord, rather than amulets, which cannot change what Allah has\ndestined and can bring no good fortune to anyone.  Even though they are not\ncapable of averting any harm, belief in amulets usually leads to idolatry over\ntime.  This can be s"

    "fullText": "Prerequisites\n·The Testimony of Faith.\nObjectives\n·To learn about the ‘Five Pillars of Islam.’\n·To understand the meaning of ‘Islam.’\nArabic Terms\n·\nHadith -\n(plural –\nahadith\n) is\na piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nKabah\n-\nThe\ncube-shaped structure located in the city of Mecca.  It serves as a focal\npoint towards which all Muslims face when praying.\n·\nSalah -\nthe Arabic word to\ndenote a direct connection between the believer and Allah.  More\nspecifically, in Islam it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the\nmost important form of worship.\n·\nRamadan -\nThe ninth month of the\nIslamic lunar calendar.  It is the month in which the obligatory fasting has\nbeen prescribed.\n·\nSawm\n– Fasting.\n·\nHajj\n– A pilgrimage to Mecca\nwhere the pilgrim performs a set of rituals.  The\nHajj\nis one of the\nfive pillars of Islam, which every adult Muslim must undertake at least once in\ntheir life if they can afford it and are physically able.\n·\nZakah -\nobligatory charity.\n·\nImaan\n- faith, belief or conviction.\nThe essential teachings of Islam\nare based on five principles, referred to as the ‘Five Pillars of Islam’, and\nsix fundamental beliefs, known as the ‘Six Articles of Faith.’ This division is\nbased on the following well known\nhadith\nof Prophet Muhammad, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. Umar, one of the closest of companions\nto the Prophet, related the following occurrence:\n“Once, while we were\nsitting with the Prophet, a man appeared before us whose clothes were\nexceedingly white and hair exceedingly black.  No signs of traveling were seen\non him and no one among us knew him.  He sat towards the Prophet, resting his\nknees against his knees and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs. He then\nsaid: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’\nThe Messenger replied: ‘Islam\nis to testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad\nis the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the compulsory\ncharity (\nzakah\n), to fast in\nRamadan\n, and to make the pilgrimage\nto the House if you are able to do so.’\nHe said: ‘You have spoken the\ntruth.’\nWe were amazed at him\nasking questions and then saying he had spoken the truth!\nHe then inquired: ‘Tell me\nabout faith (\nImaan\n)?’\nThe Prophet replied: ‘It\nis to believe in Allah, His angels, His scriptures, His messengers, and the\nLast Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its sweetness and its bitterness.’\nHe said: ‘You have spoken the\ntruth.’\nUmar then related some more\nquestions he asked and the answers given by the Prophet.  Finally, when the man\nleft, the Prophet asked:\n‘O ‘Umar, do you know who\nwas the questioner?’\nI said: ‘Allah and His\nMessenger know best.’\nThe Prophet said: ‘It was\nGabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.’”\n[1]\nThe Meaning of ‘Islam’\nThe Arabic word\n‘Islam\n’\nmeans to submit, a total surrender, a total resignation to God.  Therefore, a\n‘Muslim’ is ‘one who submits to God.’ Islam means to submit to Allah alone, to\nworship and serve Allah alone, and to believe and follow the prophet sent to\nthem.  To many non-Muslims, ‘Islam’ is a religion that began in the seventh\ncentury in the Middle East, but to Muslims, Islam has always been the only\nreligion of Allah since the time of Adam, the first man.  Thus, Islam was the\nreligion of all prophets who came after him.  In the time of Moses, Islam was\nto worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings Moses had brought,\nand Islam in the time of Jesus was to worship Allah alone and believe and\nfollow the teachings Jesus had brought, as they were both prophets sent by God\nto teach his religion.  After the coming of Prophet Muhammad, Islam is to\nworship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.\nAlthough the teachings of all the prophets about God, the Afterlife, and all\nother realities of belief were the same, there were slight differences in the\nmethods of practice, worship and service, for each prophet was sent to a\nspecific nation and specific period of time. Even though previous religions\ncome under the general heading of Islam, the religion of Muhammad has specifically\nbeen given the name ‘Islam’ by God, as it is the final religion prescribed for\nhumanity until the Day of Judgment.\nThe Five Pillars of Islam\nAllah has mandated five acts upon\nwhich the whole religion of Islam is built. Due to their importance, the\nProphet stated in another\nhadith\n:\n“Islam has been built upon\nfive…”\n…and\nthen proceeded to mention the same acts of worship described in the\nhadith\nof Gabriel above.\nThese acts\nof worship are called the Pillars of Islam, and they are as follows:\n1. Testimony of faith (\nShahadah\n)\nOne\nmust profess this testimony of faith, summarized in the two testimonies:\n(a) There\nis no deity rightfully worshipped but Allah\n(b)\nMuhammad is His Messenger.\nThrough\nthe belief and attestation of the Testimony of Faith (\nShahadah\n) one\nenter"

Islamic doctrine revolves around six aspects described by the\nProphet.\n1. Belief in Allah\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief in Allah’s\nexistence.\n(ii)  Allah is the Lord.\nHe is the Creator, the Provider, the Sustainer, and the Owner of the entire\nuniverse. None has any share in these roles.\n(iii) Allah is the only\nbeing entitled to worship. No worship, service or veneration is to be offered\nto others besides Allah or along with Him, whether they be prophets, priests,\nsaints, angels, idols, or stones.\n(iv) Allah has the most\nbeautiful and perfect of names and attributes, which none can be compared to. He\nis Unique, separate and unlike His creation. No evil or deficiency can be\nattributed to Him.\n2. Belief in the Angels\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief in the existence\nof angels, a creation of Allah.\n(ii)  Belief that they\nhave no right to receive any form of worship\n(iii) Belief in the names by\nwhich the angels are identified in the Quran and\nSunnah\n(teachings of\nProphet Muhammad).\n(iv) Belief in the special\ntasks assigned to each of them by Allah in the Quran and\nSunnah\n(teachings of Prophet Muhammad).\n3. Belief in the Revealed Scriptures\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief that Allah\nrevealed scriptures to various prophets.\n(ii)  Belief that they\ncontained the truth from Allah.\n(iii) Belief that all\nprevious scriptures other than the Quran have been altered.\n(iv) Belief in the Quran has\nseveral aspects:\na)\nBelief that it is one of the scriptures of Allah.\nb)\nBelief that it is the Final Revelation to humanity, and that no other scripture\nwill be revealed after it.\nc)\nBelief that everything in it is true, containing no falseness.\nd)\nBelief that it has remained unchanged, and will remain so for eternity.\ne)\nBelief that it has abrogated all previous scriptures before it.\n4. Belief in the Messengers\n, which entails the following:\n(i)    Belief that Allah sent prophets to every nation, calling them\nto worship and obey Allah Alone. One must believe in all of them, known or\nunknown, without rejecting any of them.\n(ii)   Belief that they were the best of humanity, chosen due to\ntheir virtuousness.\n(iii)  Belief that they were mere humans, not divine in any way, and\nthat they do not have any right to receive worship, nor did they claim so.\n(iv)  Belief that they merely conveyed the message from Allah and\ndid not legislate from their own selves.\n(v)   Belief that they did not err in conveying the message.\n(vi)  Belief that obedience to them is a must.\n(vi)  Belief that Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, was a prophet, which entails those issues discussed in the lesson\nentitled\nThe Testimony of Faith\n.\n5. Belief in Life after Death and\nthe Final Day of Judgment, which\nentails the following:\n(i)   Belief that a day\nwill come when everything will come to an end, and Allah will raise the\ncreation and judge them according to their deeds.\n(ii) Belief that those who\nbelieved and practically followed the correct religion by following the\nprophets will enter Paradise for eternity, and that those who disbelieved will\nenter the Hellfire for eternity.\n6.       Belief in Divine Decree\n, which entails the following:\n(i)   Belief that Allah’s\nForeknowledge is all inclusive and complete. He has always known everything\nthat would or would not happen, even before the creation of mankind.\n(ii)  Belief that Allah\nhas recorded everything that was going to occur until the Day of Judgment in a book\nknown as “The Mother of the Books” or “The Preserved Tablet”.\n(iii) Belief that whatever\nAllah willed has occurred, is occurring, and will occur. Nothing occurs against\nor without this Will.\n(iv) Allah created\neverything.\nWe have mentioned here the\nminimal requirements of faith in each of these six categories that Muslims\nbelieve in, as the Prophet mentioned that these articles form the basis of Islamic\nbelief and faith.\nIn subsequent lessons, we will\nexplore the essential teachings by studying each of the Five Pillars of Islam\nand the Six Articles of Faith in detail."

 Or who owns hearing and sight?  And who brings out the living\nfrom the dead and brings out the dead from the living?  And who disposes the\naffairs?’  They will say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s\npunishment (for setting up rivals with Allah)?’” (Quran 10:31)\nHe is the ever-ruling King and the Savior, the\nLiving God, full of wisdom.  No one can change His decisions.  Angels,\nprophets, human beings, and the animal and plant kingdoms are under His control. \nHistorically, few people have denied the existence of the Lord; throughout ages\npeople for most part have believed in One God, a Supreme Being, a supernatural\nCreator.\n(ii)  Allah is the only Ruler of the\naffairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver\n[1]\n,\nthe Absolute Judge, the Legislator, He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just\nlike the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the\nmoral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from\nwrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,\ndetermine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human\ninteraction and behavior.  His is the command:\n“His is the Creation and Command.” (Quran 7:54)\n(c) Allah is Entitled to Worship\nAllah has the exclusive right to be worshipped\ninwardly and outwardly, by one’s actions and by one’s heart.  Not only can no\none be worshipped\napart\nfrom Him, absolutely no one else can be\nworshipped\nalong\nwith\nHim.  He has no partners or associates in\nworship.  Worship, in its comprehensive sense and in all its aspects, is for\nHim alone.\n“There is no true god worthy of worship but He, the\nMost Merciful, the Most Compassionate.” (Quran 2:163)\nAllah’s right to be worshipped can not be over\nemphasized.  It is the essential meaning of\nLaa ilaaha ill-Allaah\n.  A\nnon-Muslim enters Islam by testifying to Allah’s sole right to be worshipped.  It\nis the crux of Islamic belief in Allah, even all of Islam.  It was the central\nmessage of all prophets and messengers sent by Allah.  They all declared\nclearly:\n“Worship Allah!  You have no other god but Him.” (Quran 7:59, 11: 50, 23:32)\nIt was the central message of Abraham, Isaac,\nIshmael, Moses, the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, and Muhamma"

Thus the word\nriyaa\nmeans showing\noff, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically\nriyaa\nmeans to perform\nacts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than\nAllah.\nThe Arabic word\nshirk\nis the opposite of\ntawheed\n,\nAllah’s oneness, and is more inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.  It means\nassociating Allah with other deities.\nShirk\nis to associate others with\nAllah in certain aspects designated as unique to Him and exclusively His in the\nQuran and\nSunnah\n.\nThere is no issue upon which Islam is so strict\nas the one of monotheism (\ntawheed\n). Associating partners with God (\nshirk\n)\nis the deadliest sin, the greatest violation with which the Lord of the heavens\nand the earth may be defied.  Death in the state of\nshirk\npermanently severs\na person from divine grace:\n“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner be set with\nHim (i.e.  the sin of\nshirk\n), and forgives all besides that to whom he\npleases.” (Quran 4:48)\nShirk\nhas many forms, some of which will\nbe discussed below.\nThe Greater\nShirk\nActs which fall under this category of\nshirk\nare regarded as unforgivable. Allah will not forgive them unless one repents.\n“Verily, Allah does not forgive\nshirk\n, but He\nforgives other than that to whom He pleases”\nThis category contradicts the very purpose of\ncreation, as expressed in Allah’s statement:\n“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship\nMe Alone.” (Quran 51:56)\nIn this category of\nshirk\n, acts of\nworship are directed to beings\nother than\nAllah or\nalongside\nHim,\nas is their rewards.  Allah gives an example of this type in the Quran, in His saying:\n“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah,\nbeing sincerely obedient to Him, but when he brings them safe to the land, lo,\nthey commit\nshirk\nwith Him.” (Quran 29:65)\nThe Quran stresses in many verses that Allah\ndoes not share His powers with any partner.  It warns those who believe their\nidols will intercede for them that they, together with the idols, will become\nfuel for Hellfire on the Day of Judgment.\nThe greater\nshirk\nincludes invoking or\nsupplicating to a false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides\nAllah.  Christians pray to a man who they believe to share divinity with Allah,\nthe Prophet of Allah Jesus, peace be upon him.  Catholics direct certain types\nof worship to saints, angels, and Mary, which they regard as “veneration”. All\nthese things are regarded as\nshirk\n.\nIt is also considered\nshirk\nto pray to\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, or to\ngraves of holy men.\nBelieving in the legislation of others, whether\ngovernments or religious leaders in opposition to the clear teachings of Islam is\nalso a major form of\nshirk\n, as Allah says:\n“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their\nrabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)\nThey took them as lords besides Allah not by directly\npraying to them, but by willfully accepting their changing the lawful into\nprohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave them\nthe authority that only Allah has - to legislate in divine law.\nAnother form of major\nshirk\nis giving any\ncreation a portion of divine love reserved for Allah.\n“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others\nbesides Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But\nthose who believe love Allah (more than anything else)...” (Quran 2:165)\nLesser Forms of\nShirk\nSwearing by other than Allah and carrying out\nreligious acts for worldly gain, like showing off or to win favors are two of\nthe lesser forms of\nshirk\n.  Allah’s Messenger said:\n“The thing I fear for you the most is ‘lesser\nshirk\n.’ The companions asked ‘Oh!  Messenger of Allah, what is “lesser\nshirk\n?”\n He replied showing off, for surely Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection\nwhen people are receiving their rewards, ‘Go to those for whom you were showing\noff in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.’” (\nAhmad\n,\nat-Tabarani\n,\nal-Baihaqi\n)"

It is the system of\ncommunication between the Creator and the created.  Allah does not send the angels\nto every single individual, nor does He ‘open the skies’ so people can climb up\nto receive the message.  His way of communication is through human messengers who\nreceive the message through the angels. Allah only sent men as prophets and messengers.\nNo angels were sent with a message to mankind. He, the Exalted, says:\n‘And they say, “Why was there not sent down to him an angel?\nBut if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they\nwould not be reprieved. And if We had made him [i.e. the Messenger] an angel,\nWe would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with\nthat in which they cover themselves.’ (6:8-9)\nWhat Does the Belief in the Messengers Entail?\nFaith in messengers is to firmly believe Allah chose\nmorally upright men to bear His message and pass it on to humanity.  Blessed\nwere those who followed them, wretched were those who refused to obey.  They\nfaithfully delivered the message, without hiding, altering, or corrupting it.  Rejecting\na messenger is rejecting the One who sent him.  Disobeying a messenger is\ndisobeying the One who commanded to obey him.\nDisbelieving in one messenger is like disbelieving in\nall the messengers. In the following verse, Allah, the Exalted, says that the\npeople of Noah disbelieved in all the messengers, even though they were\ncommanded only to follow Noah:\n‘The people of Noah disbelieved in the messengers.’\n(Quran 26:105)\nMore specifically, belief in messengers means:\n(1)  Allah sent to every nation a prophet from\namongst them, to call them to worship Allah alone and to shun false gods.\n“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our messengers whom We sent\nbefore you: ‘Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most\nMerciful (that is Allah)?’” (Quran 43:45)\nThey did not add or omit anything from the Divine\nMessage.\n“Are the messengers charged with anything but to convey\nclearly the Message?” (Quran 16:35)\n(2)  Belief in those have been specifically\nmentioned, such as Muhammad, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Noah, peace be upon them\nall.  We hold a general belief in those not mentioned by name as Allah says:\n“And indeed, We have sent messengers before you (O Muhammad); of\nsome of them We have related to you their story.  And of some We have not\nrelated to you their story” (Quran 40:78)\nWe believe the final messenger was our Prophet Muhammad\nand there is no prophet or messenger after him as Allah has said in the Quran:\n“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the\nMessenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.  And Allah is Ever All‑Aware\nof everything.” (Quran 33:40)\nThe Prophet stated categorically:\n“There will be no prophet after me.” (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nPrevious prophets were sent with laws and commandments\nspecific to that people in that time. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings\nof Allah be upon him, however was sent with a message applicable for all time,\npeople and places; thus, there is no need for more prophets to come. Another\nimportant reason is that some nations were sent more than one prophet due to the\nchanges they introduced into the religion. Since God has promised that the\nteachings of Prophet Muhammad will never undergo change and will always be preserved\nin the original language in their primary sources – the Quran and Sunnah, there\nis no need for another prophet.  In the cases of earlier prophets, scriptures were\nlost or their message became corrupted to the point that truth was hardly\ndistinguishable from falsehood.  The message of Prophet Muhammad is clear and\npreserved till the end of times.\n(3)  Belief in the sound reports that have"

Allah, the Exalted, says:\n‘Indeed, it is We who sent down the message and\nindeed, We will be its guardian.’ (15:9)\n(4)In\norder that Allah’s conclusive argument brought by the messengers against human\nbeings remains after their death.\n“Messengers\nas bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that humankind should\nhave no plea against Allah after the messengers. And Allah is Ever All\nPowerful, All Wise.” (Quran 4:165)\nNo one\ncan plea that the prophets and their messages are no longer in existence as\nlong as the scriptures are present.\nBelief in scriptures entails:\n(i)   Allah truly revealed them.\n(ii)  Belief in the names of certain scriptures.\n(iii) Belief that they contain the truth. As for\nthe scriptures prior to the Quran, since they have been changed, we believe in\nthe\noriginal\nscriptures that were revealed to the prophets.\n(iv) Belief that the Quran is a witness over them\nand confirms them. The truth remains one and the same, and thus the Quran\nconfirms the truth which was in them. As for the laws, the Quran has abrogated\nthe previous scriptures.\nFirst, a Muslim firmly believes that Divine Scriptures\nwere revealed by Allah to His messengers to guide mankind.  Muslims believe the\nQuran is not the only spoken Word of Allah, but that Allah also spoke to\nprophets before Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon\nhim.\n“…and to Moses Allah spoke directly.” (Quran 4:164)\nAllah describes true believers are those who:\n“…believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad) and\nwhat has been sent down before you.” (Quran 2:4)\nThe most important and central message of\nall\nscriptures was to worship Allah alone.\n“And we sent never a messenger before you except that we\nrevealed to him, saying, ‘there is no God but I so worship Me.” (Quran 21:25)\nSecond, we believe in the scriptures mentioned in the Quran:\n(i)   the Quran itself, revealed to Prophet\nMuhammad.\n(ii)  the Torah (\nTaurah\nin Arabic) revealed\nto Prophet Moses (different from the Old Testament read today).\n(iii) the Gospel (\nInjeel\nin Arabic) revealed\nto Prophet Jesus (different from the New Testament read in churches today).\n(iv) the Psalms (\nZabur\nin Arabic) of David.\n(v)  The scriptures (\nSuhuf\nin Arabic) of\nMoses and Abraham.\nWe have a general belief that there were other\nscriptures revealed by Allah whose names and specifics are not known to us.\nThus we cannot definitely affirm that scriptures of other religions prior to\nMuhammad other than those mentioned were revealed from Allah.\nThird, Muslims believe whatever is true in them and has\nnot been altered or corrupted in the previous scriptures.  This point will be\nelaborated below so it becomes clear and no confusion remains.\nFourth, belief that Allah revealed the Quran as a\nwitness over the previous scriptures and to confirm them, as Allah says:\n“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran)\nin truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and trustworthy in\nhighness and a witness over it (old Scriptures)” (Quran 5:48)\nMeaning the Quran confirms whatever is true in previous\nscriptures and rejects whatever alterations and changes human hands have made\nin them, and that the laws brought by the Quran overrule and abrogate any laws brought\nby the previous religions.\nOriginal Scriptures & the Bible\nWe must distinguish between two matters: the\noriginal\nTorah, Gospel, and Pslams and the\npresent day\nBible.  We believe the\noriginals\nwere Allah’s revelation, but the\npresent day\nBible does\nnot\nhave\nthe exact original scripture.\nNo scripture exists today in the original language it\nwas revealed in, except the Quran.  The Bible was not revealed in English.  Different\nbooks of today’s Bible are translations of translations and different versions\nexist.  These multiple translations were done by people whose knowledge or\nhonesty is not known.  As a result, some Bibles are bigger than others and"

 Only Allah knows.\nAl-Bayt\nal-Ma’moor\nis a sacred house in the heavens above the\nKabah\n, the\nblack cubical sacred house in Mecca.  Every day seventy thousand angels visit\nit and leave, never returning to it again, another group coming after them.\n[1]\nThe Messenger of Allah said:\n“Hell will be brought forth that day by means of\nseventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand\nangels.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nThe Names of Angels\nWe are required to believe in the names of the angels\nthat have been mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah.  They include:\nGabriel (\nJibreel\nin Arabic), Michael (\nMikaa’eel\n),\nIsrafeel\n,\nMalik\n- the gatekeeper of Hell,\nMunkar\nand\nNakeer\n,\nand\nHaarut\nand\nMaarut\nand others.\nThe names Raphael and Azra’eel are not furnished in\nIslamic texts.  Of the above, only Gabriel and Michael are mentioned in the\nBible.\nAngelic Abilities\nThe angels have great powers given to them by Allah.\nThey have the ability to take on different forms other\nthan their own.  At the moment of Jesus’ conception, Allah sent Gabriel to Mary\nin the form of a man, as Allah says in the Quran:\n“…Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as\na man in all respects.” (Quran 19:17)\nAngels also came to Abraham in human form, and he did\nnot know that they were angels until they told him so.  Similarly, angels came\nto Lot to deliver him from danger in the form of young men with beautiful faces. \nGabriel used to come to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, in different forms.  Sometimes he would appear in the form of one\nof his handsome disciples, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin.\nAngels have the ability to take human forms in some\ncircumstances involving common people, such as the ones who came to the man who\nkilled a hundred people and those who came to the blind, the bald and the leper.\nThe greatest speed known to man today is the speed of\nlight; the angels are able to travel much faster than thi"

People will enter their final abode, Hell or Paradise.\n(A) Belief in Events of the Grave\nMuslims believe that after a person\ndies, the second, intermediate phase of life begins. Many events will take\nplace in this new “world.”\nOne of the first events is the “trial”\nof the grave - everyone will be questioned by angels about their religion,\nprophet, and Lord.\nSecond, a Muslim should also believe in\nthe punishment and the bliss of the grave. Basically a Muslim must believe in\nthe details of the events that will take place in the grave as they have come\nin the Qur’an and\nSunnah\n.\n(B) Events of the Day of Judgment\nAfter the duration of this earth is\nover, Allah will command a great angel named\nIsrafeel\nto blow the\nTrumpet. At the first blowing, all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth\nwill fall unconscious, except those spared by God. The earth will be flattened\nand the mountains turned into dust.\nThe skies will rain for forty days,\npeople will be resurrected into their original bodies from their graves,\nthereby entering the third and final phase of life.\nIsrafeel\nwill blow the Trumpet for the second time upon which people will rise up from\ntheir graves, alive. The disbelievers and the hypocrites will be caught by\nsurprise and regret, whereas the believers will find it exactly as they were\ntold.\nThe angels will drive all human beings\nnaked, uncircumcised, and bare-footed to the Great Plain of Gathering called\nHashr\n.\nThe first one to be dressed on that Day will be Abraham. At the Great Plain of\nGathering, a re-created sun will shine close to their heads, and they will\nsweat according to their deeds. Some people will be sheltered under the shade\nof God’s Magnificent Throne.\nWhen the conditions will become\nunbearable, people will request God to allow the Prophets and the Messengers to\nintercede on their behalf to save them from distress. All prophets will excuse themselves,\nuntil Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, will\nbe allowed to intercede and thus Judgment will begin.\nThe Balances\nThe balances will be set and the deeds\nof men will be weighed. These balances will be real. God will give the deeds of\nHis creatures a material existence with weight. Good deeds will be placed in\none pan and the evil deeds will be placed in the other, as Allah has informed\nin the Qur’an.\nThe Records\nDisclosure of the Records of the deeds\nperformed in this life will follow. The person who will receive his record in\nhis right hand will have an easy reckoning. He will happily go back to his\nfamily. However, the person who will receive his record in his left hand would\nwish he were dead as he will be thrown into the Fire. He will be full of\nregrets as will wish that he were not handed his Record or that he had not\nknown it.\nThen Allah will judge His creation.\nThey will be reminded and informed of their good and evil deeds. The faithful\nwill acknowledge their sins and be forgiven. The disbelievers will have no good\ndeeds to declare because an unbeliever is rewarded for his good deeds in this\nlife. Some scholars are of the opinion that the punishment of an unbeliever may\nbe reduced in lieu of his good deeds, except the punishment of the great sin of\ndisbelief.\nThe Prophet’s Pond\nEvery prophet will have a pond, but the\nPond of our Prophet will be the largest, sweetest, and with the largest number\nof visitors. Its water will be sweeter than honey and whiter than milk; its\nutensils will be as numerous as the stars; and anyone who quenches his thirst\nonce from it will never thirst again.\nThe\nSiraat\nThe\nSiraat\nis a real bridge that\nwill be established over Hell extending between Paradise and the Fire. Anyone\nwho is steadfast on God’s religion in this life will find it easy to pass it.\nIt will be thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword! People will pass over\nit as fast as the blinking of an eye, lightening, wind, fast moving horses,\nrunning camels, or at a normal walking pace. Some will barely crawl over it.\nThey will be grabbed by iron hooks and thrust into the Fire. The one who\ncrosses the\nSiraat\nwill get into Paradise.\nThose who cross itwill be\nassembled at a place between Paradise and Hell. They will get their mutual\ndebts settled and then allowed to enter Paradise.\n(C) Intercession Granted to the Prophets\n& the Ri"

For this reason, it is a compulsory aspect of\nfaith, and emphasizing the importance of this belief, Ibn Umar, the famous\nCompanion of Prophet Muhammad, once swore and said of those who rejected it, ‘If\none of them were to spend gold equal to Mount Uhad in the way of Allah, it will\nnever be accepted by Allah from them, unless they believe in the divine decree\n.\n’\nUbada bin Samit, a Companion of the Prophet, was\non his death bed when his son visited him and asked,\n‘O Father, give me advice so I may hold to it.’\nUbada said,\n‘Sit down.  O my son, you shall never taste\nfaith, and shall not reach the reality of the knowledge of Allah until you have\nfaith in the divine decree, the good of it and the evil of it.’\nSo I said,\n‘O my father, how do I know what is the good of the\ndivine decree and the evil of it?’\nHe said,\n‘Know that what afflicted you, could never have missed\nyou; and what missed you, could never have afflicted you.  O my son, I heard\nthe Prophet of Allah say that the first thing Allah created was the Pen.  He\nsaid to it, ‘Write’.  So it wrote everything that would take place till the Day\nof Judgment.  O my son, if you die while not believing in this, then you will\nenter the Fire.’\nAd-Daylami says:\n“I went to Ubayy bin Ka’b and told him that I had\nsome doubts regarding the divine decree, so tell me something so that perchance\nAllah makes it leave my heart.  He said, ‘If Allah were to punish the\ninhabitants of the heavens and the earth, He would punish them and He would not\nbe unjust to them; and if He were to show Mercy to them, it would be better for\nthem than their deeds.  And if you were to spend gold the like of Mount Uhad,\nit will not be accepted by Allah until you had faith in the divine decree.  And\nknow that what afflicted you could never have missed you, and what missed you\ncould never have afflicted you.’”\nSo he went to Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud who told him\nthe same thing.  So he went to Hudthaifah bin al-Yaman\n[1]\nwho told him the same thing.  He went to Zayd bin Thabit who also told him the\nsame thing.\n[2]\nWhat is this faith in the divine decree (\nQadr\n)\nthat these great Companions considered as salvation from the Fire?  What\nexactly does one have to believe in?\n(1)  Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive\nand complete.\n(2)  Allah has recorded everything in the\nPreserved Tablet.\n(3)  Allah’s Will always comes to pass, and\nHis Ability is perfect.\n(4)  Allah created everything.\n(1)    Allah’s Foreknowledge is All Inclusive and\nComplete\nThe first necessary component is to believe in Allah’s\ninfallible foreknowledge.  Allah knows what the creatures will do, encompassing\neverything by His knowledge.  He knows all that exists, in entirety and\ntotality, by virtue of His ancient and eternal foreknowledge.  It is the same\nto Him whether it is related to His Actions or the acts of His slaves.  He\nknows their state, obedience and disobedience, sustenance, life span, successes\nand failures, and all their movements.  Before He created them, and even before\nHe created the heavens and the earth, Allah knew exactly who will enter Paradise and who will abide in Hell.\n“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or\nin the heavens.” (Quran 3:5)\n“Do you not know that Allah knows all that occurs in\nheaven and on earth?” (Quran 22:70)\nWhoever refuses it denies Allah’s perfection,\nbecause the opposite of knowledge is either ignorance or forgetfulness.  It\nwould mean Allah would have been mistaken in His foreknowledge of future\nevents; He would no longer be Omniscient.  Both are deficiencies which Allah is\nfree of.  When Pharaoh asked Moses:\n“(Pharaoh said:) ‘What about the generations of old?’\n(Moses) said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord,\nin a Record.  My Lord is neither unaware nor He forgets’” (Quran 20:51, 52)\nAllah is not unawar"

They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\n·\nShirk\n- a word that implies ascribing\npartners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or\nbelieving that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another\nbesides Allah.\n·\nKhushoo\n- the act of being completely\nsolemn, submissive and humble towards Allah during the prayer.\nUnlike\nthe descriptions of the devil in Christian doctrine,\nShaytan\nis not a\nfallen angel; rather he is a\nJinn\nwho can think, reason and has free\nwill. Allah allowed him to reside amongst the Angels, but because of his pride\nand arrogance that you can read about in the story of Prophet Adam on the\nwebsite\nwww.islamreligion.com\n, he despairs\nof ever knowing Allah’s mercy and has vowed not to inhabit the depths of Hell\nalone. Satan’s wish is to take as many human beings with him to the Hellfire as\nhe can. Make no mistake about it; Satan is humankind’s mortal enemy. He is\ncunning, crafty and supremely arrogant. Quran warns us of his enmity over and\nover.\n“O children of Adam.  Let not\nShaytan\ndeceive you...”\n(Quran 7:27)\n“Surely\nShaytan\nis an enemy to you so take him as an\nenemy...” (Quran 35:6)\n“...And whoever takes\nShaytan\nas a protector or helper\ninstead of Allah, has surely suffered a manifest loss.” (Quran 4:119)\nIt is important to understand that even Satan himself\nrecognises the Oneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped. Allah has\ninformed us that the promises of Satan are nothing but deceptions and lies, and\nSatan concurs, for he can offer nothing.\n“And\nShaytan\nwill say when the matter has\nbeen decided: Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too\npromised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I\ncalled you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves...”\n(Quran 14:22)\nEvery\nact of disobedience that is hated by Allah is loved by\nShaytan\n, he loves\nimmorality and sin.  He whispers into the ears of the believers, he\ndisrupts prayer and the remembrance of Allah. One of Islam’s greatest scholars,\nIbn ul Qayyim, may God have mercy on him, said: “One of his (Satan’s) plots is\nthat he always bewitches people’s minds until they are deceived, he makes\nattractive to the mind that which will harm it”.\nSatan\nhas\nwide-ranging\nexperience in the field of deception; he has tricks and temptations and he\nwhispers relentlessly. Satan is able to pinch and poke, implanting thoughts and\ndesires. However Allah has not left humankind defenseless. He has provided us\nwith weapons and one of the greatest is information.\nSatan is our\nmortal enemy and in order to combat his tricks and illusions we need to know\nhim well. The long term goal of Satan is to deprive as many people as possible\nof Paradise and to lead them to Hell.  To achieve this aim he has set many\nshort term goals. Being aware of these goals means we are able to arm ourselves\nwith weapons of defence.\nShort Term Goals\n1.To cause people to commit the great sin of\nshirk\n. Everyone\nwho worships something other than Allah, be it an idol, a statue, the sun, the\nmoon, a person or a principle, is in essence worshipping Satan.\n[1]\n2.To encourage people to commit sins and acts of disobedience. When\nSatan despairs of ever being worshipped he is content with being obeyed in\nmatters that seem insignificant.\n[2]\nHe loves immorality and sin because it has a direct effect on a person’s religious\ncommitment.\n3.To prevent people from doing good deeds. Satan not only causes\npeople to commit sin and acts of disobedience, he is also content with\npreventing them from doing acts of good.  Satan is patient; he lays in wait,\nfilling our minds with doubts, and superstitions. When a person is planning on\ndoing a good deed or action, he whispers to them to avoid it and plants small\nnagging doubts in their mind.\n4.To damage acts of worship. If Satan is not able to prevent\npeople from obeying Allah and performing righteous actions, he strives to\ncorrupt their acts of worship. When a person is praying he whispers and\ndistracts him. Satan’s desire is to prevent a person from taking their reward\nfor praying with\nkhushoo\nand eventually to lead him or her away from\nAllah altogether.\n5.\nTo cause mental and physical harm.In addition to causing\nbelievers to commit acts of\nshirk\n, Satan also aims to cause physical and\nmental harm. For instance he sends bad dreams to cause a person distress and\nfear. He disturbs people from the time they are born right up until the moment\nof death. In their final moments, he continues his whispering and harassment to\nprevent a person from calling on Allah and confirming their belief in God"

They often claim the knowledge of the future\nand use various methods and mediums from which they claim to extract their\ninformation, like reading tea-leaves, drawing lines, writing numbers,\npalm-reading, casting horoscopes, crystal ball gazing, rattling bones, and\nthrowing sticks.\nDo they truly know what they claim?\n1.    Some of them have no real knowledge.  They go\nthrough a series of meaningless rituals and then make calculated general\nguesses.  Some of their guesses may coincide with the truth.  People tend to remember\nthe few predictions that come true and forget about the many which do not.\n2.    Another group has contact with the\nJinn\n. \nIt usually involves the grave sin of\nshirk\n, and those involved tend to\nbe more accurate in their information.\nRole of\nJinn\nThe evil\nJinn\ncan often be summoned by performing\nsacrilegious acts forbidden in the religion to aid their human partners in sin\nand disbelief.  Once contact with the\nJinn\nis made by fortune-tellers,\nthe\nJinn\nmay inform them of certain events in the future.  The Prophet,\nmay the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, described how the\nJinn\ngather information about the future.   He related that the\nJinn\nwere\nable to travel to the lower reaches of the heavens and listen in on some of the\ninformation about the future, which the angels pass among themselves.   They\nwould then return to the earth and feed the information to their human contacts. \n(\nBukhari\n).  From this it is clear that the\nJinn\ndo\nnot\nhave knowledge of the unseen, rather they steal words that they hear from the\nangels; in fact, the angels themselves do not have any knowledge of that until\nAllah tells them of it.\nThe\nJinn\nare also able to inform their human\ncontact of the future through another channel.  When someone comes to a\nfortune-teller, the fortune-teller’s Jinn gets information from the man’s\nQareen\n(the\njinn\nassigned to every human being) of what plans he had made prior\nto his coming.  So the fortune-teller is able to tell him that he will do this\nor that, or go here or there.  By this method, the real fortune-teller is also\nable to learn about a stranger’s past in vivid detail.  He is able to tell a\ntotal stranger of his parents’ names, where he was born, and his childhood.\nVisiting Fortune-tellers\nThe Prophet laid down principles which clearly forbade\nany form of visitation of fortune-tellers.  He said:\n“The prayer of whoever approaches a fortune-teller\nand asks him about anything will not be accepted for 40 days and nights.” (Muslim)\nThe punishment is for simply approaching a\nfortune-teller and asking him questions out of curiosity.\nBelief in Fortune-tellers\nAnyone who visits a fortune-teller\nbelieving\nthat\nhe knows the unseen and the future has committed\nkufr\n(disbelief).  The\nProphet said:\n“Whosoever approaches a fortune-teller and believes\nwhat he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.” (Abu\nDawud)\nSuch a belief assigns to creation some of Allah’s\nattributes with regard to the knowledge of the unseen and the future.\nThe same applies to anyone who reads the books and\nwritings of fortune-tellers, listens to them on the Internet, radio, or the TV.\nAll the various methods used around the world by\noracles, fortune-tellers, and the likes, are forbidden to Muslims.\nPalm-reading, I-Ching, fortune cookies, tea leaves as\nwell as Zodiacal signs and Bio-rhythm computer programs, all claim to inform\nthose who believe in them about their future.   However, Allah has stated in no\nuncertain terms that He alone knows the future:\n“Indeed, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone.  It is\nHe who sends down the rain and knows the contents of the wombs.   No one knows\nwhat he will earn tomorrow nor in which land he will die, but Allah is\nall-knowing and aware.”(Quran 31:34)\nAstrology\nAstrology is the study of the relationship between the\nmovements of the stars and their influence on people and events.\nAstrology has dramatically spread in recent years.  Books,\nmagazines and newspapers are published, under various titles such as"

    "fullText": "Prerequisites\n·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and\nArticles of Faith (2 parts).\nObjectives\n·To learn the second two components that\nbelief in divine decree entails, i-e everything happens by the Will of Allah and\nHis Ability is perfect, and that Allah is the One who created everything.\n·To clarify and dispel the confusion\nregarding the question of freedom of will.\nArabic Terms\n·\nQadr\n– divine decree.\n(3)    Allah’s Will Passes, and His Ability is Perfect\nWhatever Allah wills comes to pass, and whatever\nAllah does not will does not happen.  Nothing occurs in the heavens or on the earth\nwithout the Will of Allah.  Hence, whatever is in the universe occurs by the\nWill of Allah, be it a divine act or actions of the creation:\n“Had He so willed, he would indeed have guided you\nall.” (Quran 6:149)\nIf we were to say that something occurs in\nexistence without Allah willing it, that would mean that things can occur\nwithout the Will of Allah, and that would be a shortcoming in Allah’s power and\nwill. Rather, everything that occurs can only be if Allah wills it. If He did\nnot will it to occur, it could have never come into being.\nLikewise the actions of the creation occur by\nthe Will of Allah:\n“And you do not will except that Allah wills – Lord of\nthe worlds.” (Quran 81:29)\nNo one can do anything except if Allah wills it\nto be, had He willed that they do not take place, they would not have occurred.\n(4)    Allah Created Everything\n“He has created everything, and has measured it\nexactly according to its own measurement.”\n“For it is He who creates everything and determines\nits nature in accordance with (His own) design.” (Quran 25:2)\nThis includes our characteristics and our deeds.\nThe human beings are created by Allah and so are\nthe actions and statements that result from them.  This is because the actions\nand the statements of a person are his characteristics; if the person is a\ncreation, then so are his characteristics a creation of Allah.\n“While Allah has created you and what you do.” (Quran 37:96)\nWe are given the physical ability and a choice. \nOur abilities like intelligence and memory differ just like our characteristics\nlike height, weight, and color.  Also, we are given a will and have a choice.\nIf one of them does not exist, the act would not\nbe performed.  The One who has created the choice and the ability is Allah, the\nCreator of the cause and the effect.  Since Allah has created both, the ability\nand the choice in us, hence the acts that we perform are also created by Allah.\nHuman Freedom of Will\nIslamic belief in the divine decree (\nQadr\n),\nevery human act both in material and spiritual life is predestined, keeps human\nliberty intact without denying divine interference in human affairs.  It does\nnot undermine the principle of man’s moral freedom and responsibility.  Man is\nnot a helpless creature borne along by destiny.  It is incorrect to believe the\naction of fate is blind, arbitrary, and relentless.\nAll is known, but freedom is also granted.\nMan is responsible for his acts.  Lethargic\nnations and individuals indolent to ordinary affairs of life are to blame\nthemselves, not Allah.  Man is bound to obey the moral law; and he will receive\nmerited punishment or reward as he violates or observes that law.  However, if such\nis so, man must have it in his power to break or keep the law.  Allah would not\nhold us responsible for something unless we were capable of doing it:\n“Allah does not burden any human being with more than\nhe is well able to bear.” (Quran 2:286)\n“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as\nyou can.” (Quran 64:16)\nEveryone knows the difference between being\ncompelled to do something and being free; having the choice of doing it, between\na gun put to one’s head and being free in making decisions.\nSome people mistakenly imagine the divine decree\nof each individual’s future life is so rigorously predetermined in all its\ndetails by Allah that his own volitions or desires have no power to alter the\ncourse of events.  It defeats common sense to reject faith or commit a sin even\nbefore knowing whether or not it was destined! Everyone has the ability to\nchoose between righteousness and evil, so how can a person willfully choose the\nroad to perdition and use the divine decree (\nQadr\n) as an excuse?  It is\nmore appropriate to walk on the blessed path and attribute it to one’s destiny. \nAllah knows from eternity with infallible certainty who will be saved and\ndoomed, while Allah has this infallible foreknowledge, we, on our part, cannot\nhave an absolutely certain assurance as to how we will end.  The Prophet, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, spoke the truth when he said:\n“Seek what is beneficial to you, and ask\nAllah for help.  Do not lose hope, and if something were to afflict you, do not\nsay ‘If I had done so and so’, because saying ‘If’ opens the doors for the\ndevil.”\n“If he is from the successful ones, then\nthe deeds of the successful ones are made easy for him.” (\nSaheeh"

Allah cautions us not to take part in such\nconversations. He says:\n“And when you see those who engage in a false conversation\nabout Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till\nthey turn to another topic.  And if Satan causes you to forget, then after the\nremembrance sit not you in the company of the wrongdoing people.” (Quran 6:68)\nMaking people afraid of his\nallies.\nAnother way Satan misguides people is to make them afraid of his (Satan’s)\ntroops and allies.  He has surrounded himself with evil minions, jinn and human\nbeings.  He instills the thoughts that they are powerful and fearsome, and if\nnot obeyed they can harm us.\n“It is only\nShaytan\nthat suggests to you the fear of\nhis supporters and friends; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true)\nbelievers.” (Quran3:175)\nSatan\nmisguides a\nperson through what he loves and desires.\nSatan finds out what we love or\ndesire and uses it against us.  He also passes this information on to his\nhelpers and they attack us with the very things we are attached to.  How often\nare our prayers disturbed by thoughts of our children or spouse? Are we guilty\nof shopping and delaying our prayer? Satan senses what we like and then sets\nabout to twist our thoughts.\nBy instilling doubts.\nShaytan\ndoes not want anyone to turn to Allah in repentance, regretting (past mistakes)\nand turning towards what is right and good.  Instead he wants to divert people\naway from Allah by using many kinds of temptations and baseless arguments.  He instills\ndoubts to make a person feel anxious and uncertain.\nThrough alcohol, gambling,\nidolatry, witchcraft and fortunetelling.\nAlthough Allah warns us against\nthese practices, human beings are weak and Satan takes advantage of this by\nmaking these practices look attractive or worthwhile.  He encourages people to\nengage in these pra"

    "fullText": "Objective\n·To understand how Islam views dreams and dream\ninterpretation.\nArabic Terms\n·\nIstikarah\n– the prayer for Guidance.\n·\nShaytan\n- sometimes spelled\nShaitan\nor\nShaytaan\n.    It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to\ndenote the devil or Satan, the personification of evil.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas\nseveral meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is\ngenerally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or\napproved.\nThe significance of dreams\nA dream\nis a series of thoughts, images and sensations that occur in the mind whilst a\nperson is asleep.  Dreams are a universal human experience and the dreamer has\nvery little control over the content.  Our experiences in dreams have very lifelike\nqualities and can be extremely vivid and often bizarre.  Some people report\nvery emotional experiences during dreams and frightening or upsetting dreams\nare often referred to as nightmares.  Throughout the history of humankind\npeople have tried to interpret their dreams and many people believe they\ncontain important messages or symbols.  There are many superstitions and\nbeliefs associated with dreams and Islam has cleared up many misconceptions\ninvolving dreams and their interpretation.\nThe scholars of Islam say that while dreams can be\nmeaningful, not all dreams should be considered important.  Ibn Siren is\nconsidered the Islamic world’s foremost expert on dream interpretation and he\ncalls it a difficult science that should be treated with the utmost care.  The importance\nof a dream is usually determined by the impression it makes on the dreamer,\nhowever most dreams have no real value and thus no need for interpretation.\nThe three types of dreams\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, told us that there are three types of dreams\n[1]\n. \nA true dream (sometimes called a good dream) that comes to us from Allah, a bad\nor frightening dream that comes from the\nShaytan\nand the third is a\ndream that comes from a person’s experiences and thoughts.  Each one should be\nmanaged differently.\nProphet Muhammad said that if anyone has a dream that he\nlikes then it is from Allah.  He should therefore thank Allah for it and\nnarrate it to others\n[2]\n.   The Prophet went\nfurther and said that if a person has a good dream, he should expect good\nthings to happen and only narrate the dream to people that he likes\n[3]\n. \nAn example of this in the Quran is when Prophet Yusuf narrated to his father the\ndream he had about the sun, the moon and the stars prostrating themselves to\nhim.  His father, Prophet Yaqub told Yusuf not to relate the dream to his\nbrothers.\n“Remember when Yusuf said to his father: ‘O my father! Verily,\nI saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon - I saw them\nprostrating themselves to me.’ He (the father) said, ‘O my son! Relate not your\nvision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.’…” (Quran\n12: 4 & 5)\nFrightening or disturbing dreams are from\nShaytan\nand are nothing more than his attempts to scare and terrify us.  Prophet\nMuhammad tells us that theses dreams will not harm a person in anyway.  Thus if\na person has a bad dream or nightmare he should spit dryly (no saliva should be\nejected) to his left three times and seek refuge from\nShaytan\nwith Allah\n[4]\n. \nHe also recommended turning over\n[5]\n.\nThe third type of dream is one that does not fit into\neither the good or bad category.   These dreams come from what a person has\nbeen thinking or worrying about or from the experiences, events and fears\nstored in the memory and the subconscious.   These dreams are of no consequence\nand there is no interpretation for them.\nRules of dream interpretation\nIt is the opinion of most Islamic scholars that dreams\nshould be interpreted only by someone that is qualified to do so.  The reason\nfor this is that the interpretation of dreams can be problematic.  Take for\ninstance a simple thing such as knowing whether the dream you had was about you\nor someone else or even someone connected to someone else.  A companion of\nProphet Muhammad’s saw in a dream the great enemy of Islam Abu Jahl becoming\nMuslim and pledging allegiance to the Prophet.  This did not happen; it was Abu\nJahl’s son who sometime later converted to Islam and vowed allegiance.  Symbol’s\nin dreams are also problematic because they mean different things to different\npeople.\nWe must be careful not to rely too much on dreams or\nbelieve that they are filled with hidden meanings and symbols.  However there\nare some dreams that are easy to interpret.  If Prophet Muhammad appears in a\ndream and looks as he is described in the\nSunnah\nthen we can be sure that\nthis is a true dream, one from Allah and full of good tidings.  The Prophet\nsaid that whoever sees him in a dream has indeed seen the truth\n[6]\n.\nIn regards to interpreting dreams as an answer to an\nIstikarah\nprayer\n[7]\n,\nthen this is an incorrect practice.  Allah does not answer this prayer through dreams."

One, they can travel very fast.  Allah tells us in the\nQuran:\n\nlfreet\nof the\njinn\nsaid, “I will bring it\nto you before you can rise from your place.  Surely, I am strong and trustworthy\nfor such work.” (Quran 27:39)\nThey can reach the skies as they are quoted to say in\nthe Quran:\n“And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled\nwith stern guards and flaming fires.“ (Quran 72:8)\nThey can take different shapes as mentioned earlier.  The\nevil\njinn\n– the devils – can possess the human body.  They can also\nwhisper thoughts and influence human beings:\n“From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in\nthe hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one’s heart after one\nremembers Allah).” (Quran 114:4)\nJinn\n’s Weaknesses\nEven though the evil\njinn\n– the devils – have\nspecial abilities, a believer is protected by Allah.  The devils cannot harm a\nrighteous Muslim by Allah’s permission.\n“Surely, My (faithful) slaves - over them you have no power; and\nyour Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)\nThe following are some examples of their limited powers:\n1.    They fear some believers.\n“Surely, My (faithful) slaves – over them you have no power,\nand your Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)\n“The believer emaciates his devil in the same way\nthat one of you weakens his camel during travel.” (\nMusnad\n)\n2.    The Prophet said that if we cover our plates\nand say ‘\nBismillah\n,’ the devils cannot take off the cover.  Similarly,\nthey cannot enter a house if we close the door saying ‘\nBismillah\n.’\n“If the man enters his house and mentions the name\nof Allah upon entering it and upon eating therein, Satan says, ‘There is no\nlodging for you here and no meal here.’ But if the man enters his house and\nneglects to mention the name of Allah upon entering it, Satan says, ‘I have\nfound lodging for you.’ And if he does not mention Allah’s name upon eating his\nmeal, Satan says, ‘I have found lodging and a meal.’ (\nSaheeh Muslim, Musnad\n)\n3.    They can take different forms, but they can\nnot take the form of Prophet Muhammad.  The Prophet said,\n“Whoever sees me in a dream will have indeed seen\nme, for Satan cannot mimic my appearance.” Abu ‘Abdullah said, “Ibn Sirin said,\n‘Only if he sees the Prophet in his (real) shape.’” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari"

They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\n·\nIblees\n– the Arabic name for Satan.\n·\nQareen\n– a devil attached to every\nhuman being.\n·\nShaytan\n- sometimes spelled\nshaitan\nor\nshaytaan\n. It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to\ndenote the devil or Satan, the personification of evil.\n·\nShayateen\n– devils, plural of ‘\nshaytan\n’.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word\nSunnah\nhas\nseveral meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally\naccepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.\n·\nSurah\n– chapter of the Quran.\nWe learned in the previous lesson that some\njinn\nare good and some are evil. Allah has given them the ability to become\nbelievers or disbelievers. The evil\njinn\nare known as devils or\nshayateen\nin Arabic. The leader of the devils is known as Satan or\nIblees\nin\nArabic. He has a very ugly appearance and has two horns.\nThe Story of\nIblees\nSatan used to worship Allah with the angels before he\nbecame arrogant. He chose the evil path in life, knowing it would bring him\npunishment. Allah created Adam and ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam.\nSatan used to worship Allah with the angels, so he was also addressed to\nprostrate himself as well but he refused Allah’s order out of arrogance. As a result,\nSatan was cast out of Paradise. He made a promise to Allah that he will mislead\nthe children of Adam if Allah allowed him to live till the Day of Judgment.\nThus, he became the greatest enemy of man. He saw that Adam was the cause for his\nexpulsion from Heaven and the reason why Allah cast His curse upon him.\nMission of Satan and the Devils\nSatan, or\nIblees\n, is the Commander in Chief of\nthe battle against the earthly human beings. He lays the strategy of this\nbattle against human beings, dispatches his soldiers, and then reviews their\nperformance. He praises those who accomplish his mission. The Prophet of Allah\nhas told us,\n“\nIblees\nsets his throne on the water. From there,\nhe sends out his troops to tempt mankind. The one whom he regards as closest to\nhim is the one who causes the greatest temptation. One of them returns to him\nand says, ‘I stayed with so and so and did not leave him until he did such and\nsuch,’ and he is told, ‘You have done nothing.’ Then one comes and reports, ‘I\ndid not leave him until he separated from his wife.’\nIblees\nthen brings\nhim near to him and says, ‘How fine are you!’\n[1]\nHe has soldiers among the\njinn\n, known as devils,\nand among human beings. Among his soldiers from the\njinn\nis the\nqareen\n,\nthe devil that accompanies every human being.\nThe ultimate goal of Satan is to take human beings with\nhim to Hellfire and keep them from entering Paradise. He does this by getting\npeople to worship others besides Allah. If he cannot do that, then he leads\nthem to sin and to disobey Allah. He tries to block people from doing good\ndeeds. If he cannot do that, then he will do his best to ruin the acts of\nworship so the person will not receive any reward for them.\nOne of the means by which Satan misleads people is\nsorcery. Sorcerers can sometimes perform acts to please the devils who in turn\ndo their bidding. Sorcery is sometimes used to create a separation between\nhusband and wife (Quran 2:102). Sorcery is of two types, some of it is an\nillusion and some is real. Real sorcery can cause separation between spouses\nand cause other harms.\nProtection Against Satan and the Devils\n1.    The greatest means of protecting oneself\nagainst the devil is by sticking to the Quran and\nSunnah\nand by living\naccording to Islam’s teachings. Allah has said in the Quran,\n“O you who believe, enter into Islam completely and do not\nfollow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an open enemy to you.” (Quran\n2:208)\n2.    Seeking protection with Allah.  Actually\nturning to Allah and asking Him for protection is one of the best ways to be\nsafe from Satan.  Allah teaches us in the Quran the words of protection that\ncan be translated as,\nAnd say, ‘My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the whisperings\nof the devils and I seek refuge with You, My Lord, in case they come close to\nme.’” (Quran 23:97-98)\n3.    Place your children and property under\nAllah’s care.  Allah’s Messenger used to seek protection for his grand children\nwith these words:\n“U’eedhu-kuma bi kalimaa-til-laahit-taamah min\nkulli shaytaanin wa haama wa min kulli aynin laamah.”\n“I commend you two to the protection of the perfect\nwords of Allah, from every devil and vermin, and from every evil eye.” (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n)\n4.    The best words to seek Allah’s protection.\nThe last two chapters of the Quran,\nSurah\nal-Falaq and\nSurah\nan-Naas, are the best words to seek protection (\nSunan\nNasai\n).\n5.    Seek protection with the Verse o"

The desire to achieve\n Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all\nother desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on\nwealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of\nmaking it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of\ndevotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on\npleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One\nmust remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.\nTo be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams\nand realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!\nUltimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate\ngoal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. \nParadise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of\nGod, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence\nof pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is\nan abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel\nthe least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally\nrealized.\nIslamic Gardens\nJannah\n(a\nbeautiful garden) has historically inspired beauty, something which ca"

    "fullText": "Objectives\n·To learn about some of the joys that Paradise\nholds.\n·To appreciate that the greatest joy will be\nseeing Allah in Paradise.\nThe Joys of Paradise\nThose who enter Paradise will do so in their\nmost perfect, beautiful form.  Their hearts will be one.  They will neither\nspit, nor blow their noses, or defecate.  They will remain young forever,\nstrong and potent without the inconveniences of body hair.\nThe worldly pleasures pretty much fade in the\nface of heavenly delights\n.\nThe pleasures of this world are\nfleeting and short-lived, for ‘…short is the enjoyment of this world,’ whereas\nthe joys of Paradise will be unending, as ‘…the provision is eternal.’\nThe fine clothes, delicious foods, soothing\ndrinks, ornate jewels, and grand palaces in Paradise are far superior to what\nis in this world.  The ‘real estate’ of Paradise is described by the Prophet to\nbe better than the whole world!\nParadise is free of any pollutants, foul odors,\npain, or discomfort.  The hearts and speech will be pure.  No one will be\noffended or insulted.\nThe delicious, ripe fruits of Paradise will be\nwithin easy reach, ready for its residents to pick whatever fruit one desires. \nAny food or drink will be available on demand.  Paradise has seas of water,\nwine, milk, and honey from which rivers will flow out.  You simply take your\npick!  It has fountains scented with camphor and ginger, and shady valleys.  The\nwine will not cause hangovers.  It is “delight for those who drink”, bringing\nneither drunkenness\n[1]\nnor rousing\nfolly or quarrelling.\nThe inhabitants of Paradise will be served in\ngold and silver goblets and dishes.  Their finest silk clothes will be\ndecorated with gold, silver, and pearls…better than any man-made garment!  The\nscent of Musk will emanate from their bodies..  Their palaces will distinguished\nby refined elegance and be fully furnished.  They will be able to sit and\nrecline in their gardens.  The beautiful bright colored couches will be lined\nwith silk brocade.  Eye catching cushions and splendid carpets will add style\nand luxury.  A cozy place most people can simply dream of in this world, and  tranquil\nspot away from distractions;  peaceful, comfortable, and richly decorated.\nThe faithful, who ‘will be served by immortal youths,\nwith cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine;’ exquisite banquets\nserved in priceless vessels.\nThe faithful will visit one another and reunite\nwith family and friends who made it to Paradise.  All wishes will be fulfilled,\nsome in the strangest ways.  The Messenger of Allah said:\n“If the believer in Paradise wishes for a\nchild, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in\nan instant.” (\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\nNaturally, running after worldly pleasures at\nthe cost of heavenly delights will be a cause of much sorrow for people who\nwill enter Hell.\nSpouses & Intimacy in Paradise\nJust as some people can’t perceive colors, so we\nmay be soul-blind and soul-deaf.  The soul’s yearnings simply don’t get through\nto consciousness; or if they do, we try to numb ourselves to them with\nmedications or frenzied activities.  The resulting alienation within our very\nhearts bears its own loneliness.  The soul wants to be attached and involved,\nbecause it is through such intimacy that it is nourished, initiated, and\ndeepened.  The faithful will enjoy earthly and heavenly spouses in Paradise\nto satisfy the soul’s cravings for companionship and intimacy.  All the\nurgencies of the soul – the feeling of longing, the ache of desire for a\nbeautiful, compatible partner, and the urgency to visit old friends – will be\nmet.  The select will rejoice in the company of the parents, spouses and\nchildren who were believers.\nThe faithful will be clothed in the richest\nsilks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns\nset with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, and pillows. In order\nto enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,\nand vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise\n“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most\nable to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and\nstrength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose\ntheir youth.”\nThe faithful will enter Paradise in the best and\nmost perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their\neternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.\nThe faithful will enjoy specially crafted\nmaidens, or\nhouris\n, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of\nmortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,\nand inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public\nview in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of\ngratification.\nVision of Allah\nIn heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly\nand distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through"

Killing!”\n·The common appearance of lewd acts, working\nto bring about lewd acts, the cutting off of the ties of relationship and the\ntrusting of deceivers.\n·The disappearance of knowledge and the\nappearance of ignorance.\n·Wealth will be in abundance; so abundant\nthat a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his\nZakah\n,\nand whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be\noffered) will say, ‘I am not in need of it.’\n·The people compete with one another in\nconstructing high buildings.\n·A man when passing by a grave of someone\nwill say, ‘Would that I was in his place’.\n·Two parties of Muslims will confront each\nother and there is a large-scale massacre amongst them and the claim of both of\nthem is the same.\n·People will establish ties with strangers\nand sever relations with their near and dear ones.\n·Earthquakes will increase.\n·Any gain is shared out only among the rich,\nwith no benefit to the poor.\n·A trust becomes a means of making a profit.\n·Paying\nZakah\nbecomes a burden.\n·Men obey their wives and disobey their\nmothers; and treat their friends kindly whilst shunning their father"

More details will be given below.\n2.Rejected Intercession: This is intercession which according to\nthe texts of the Quran and\nSunnah\nis invalid and ineffective as will be explained\nin Part 2.\nThere are two types of Accepted Intercession that will\ntake place in the Hereafter:\nA. Intercession Exclusive to the Prophet\nThe first type is an exclusive intercession that which\nwill be granted only to Prophet Muhammad and no one else will share it with\nhim. It is of various kinds:\n1.The Greatest Intercession also known as\nmaqam-mahmood\nor\nthe ‘station of praise and glory.’ The earlier and later generations will ask\nthe Prophet to intercede for them with their Lord so that He might relieve them\nof the horrors of the Day of Judgement. This is the ‘station of praise and\nglory’ which Allah has promised to him in the Quran:\n“And in some parts of the night (also) offer the prayer with\nit (i.e. recite the Quran in the prayer) as an additional prayer for you (O\nMuhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to\nmaqam-mahmood\n.” (Quran\n17:79)\nThe Prophet Muhammad will intercede for all of mankind\nso that the reckoning can begin. In a narration it states that mankind will be\ndistressed and anxious and will reach a point where they can no longer bear the\nlengthy wait and will say, “Who will intercede for us with our Lord so that He\nwill pass judgement among His slaves?”  So people will come to the prophets,\neach of whom will say, “I am not suitable for this position,” until they come\nto our Prophet, who will say, “I am able to do it.” So he will intercede for\nthem that judgement may be passed.\nThis intercession belongs exclusively to the Prophet\nMuhammad.\nThere are many other reports that speak of this\nintercession: “The people will fall on their knees on the Day of Resurrection,\neach nation following its prophet, saying, ‘O So and so, intercede!’ until\nintercession is granted to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be\nupon him). On that Day Allah will resurrect him to a station of praise and\nglory.”\n[1]\n2.Intercession of the Prophet Muhammad that the believers be\ngranted permission to enter Paradise.\nThe Messenger of Allah said: “I will come to the gate of\nParadise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The\ngatekeeper will say, ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say, ‘I was\ncommanded not to open it for anyone before you.’”\n[2]\nAccording to another report narrated by Muslim, “I will\nbe the first one to intercede concerning Paradise.”\n3.Intercession of Prophet Muhammad for his paternal uncle Abu\nTalib, so that the torment of the Fire be reduced for him. This applies only in\nthe case of the Prophet and his paternal uncle Abu Talib.\nOnce, Abu Talib was mentioned in the presence of the\nMessenger of Allah. He said, “Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the\nDay of Resurrection, and he will be placed in a shallow part of the Fire which\nwill come up to his ankles and cause his brain to boil.”\n[3]\n4.Intercession that some people of his\nUmmah\nmay enter\nParadise without being brought to account.\nThis kind of intercession was mentioned by some of the\nscholars, who quoted as evidence the lengthy hadith which states:\n“Then it will be said, ‘O Muhammad, raise you head; ask,\nit will be given to you; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ So I\nwill raise my head and say, ‘My\nUmmah\n, O Lord; my\nUmmah\n, O Lord;\nmy\nUmmah\n, O Lord.’ It will be said, ‘Admit those among your\nUmmah\nwho are  not to be brought to account through the right-hand gate of Paradise.\nThey will share the other gates with the people of other nations.’”\n[4]\nB.

Allah must approve of the person for\nwhom\nintercession is made.\n“…and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is\npleased” (Quran 21:28)\nOne for whom intercession is made must be a believer in\nTawheed\nbecause Allah is not pleased with the\nmushrikoon\n(polytheists).\n.\nIt was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who will be the most\nblessed of people by your intercession of the Day of Resurrection?’ The\nMessenger of Allah said:\n“O Abu Hurayrah, I thought that no one would ask me\nabout this\nhadith\nbefore you because I have seen how keen you are to\nlearn\nhadith\n.  The people who will be most blessed by my intercession on\nthe Day of Resurrection are those who say\nLa ilaha illa Allah\nsincerely\nfrom the heart.’”\n2.  Allah must give permission to intercede.\n“Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His\nPermission?” (Quran 2:255)\n3.  Allah must approve of the\nintercessor\n.\n“…whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has\ngiven leave for whom He wills and is pleased with” (Quran 53:26)\nRejected Intercession\nThe Rejected Intercession is one that\ndoes not meet\nthe conditions\nrequired for permission from Allah or His being pleased\n(with the intercessor or the one for whom intercession is made), such as the\nintercession which the people of\nshirk\nbelieve that their gods will be\nable to do for them.  Many of them only worship their gods because they believe\nthat they will intercede for them with Allah, and that they are middle men\nbetween them and Allah.  Allah says:\n“Surely, the religion is for Allah only.  And those who take\nprotectors besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near\nto Allah.’ Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they\ndiffer.  Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever” (Quran\n39:9)\nAllah tells us that this kind of intercession is\nineffective and of no benefit:\n“So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to\nthem” (Quran 74:48)\n“And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not benefit\nanother, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be\ntaken from him nor will they be helped.” (Quran 2:48)\n“O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided\nfor you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship,\nnor intercession.  And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.” (Quran\n2:254)\nHence, Allah did not accept the intercession of His\nKhaleel\n[1]\nIbrahim for his father Azar who was a pagan.  The Prophet said:\n“Ibrahim will meet his father on the Day of\nResurrection, and Azar’s face will be dark and covered with dust.  Ibrahim will\nsay to him, ‘Did I not tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will say, ‘Today\nI will not disobey you.'’ Ibrahim will say, ‘O Lord! You promised me not to\ndisgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me\nthan cursing and dishonoring my father?’ Then Allah will say, ‘I have forbidden\nParadise to the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrahim, what is\nbeneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a\ndhabh\n(an\nanimal,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown into the\nFire.”\n[2]\nWisdom of Intercession\nThe point of intercession is to honor the person\ninterceding.  It is Allah’s way of making the person stand out in front of His\ncreation.  That is the reason why Prophet Muhammad and the prophets will be\nallowed to intercede as detailed above.\nFurthermore, intercession should not make a person\ncomplacent about sins.  A person must never think that he can rely on\nintercession and sin all he wants!  For, he is not guaranteed that Allah will\nallow someone to intercede for him.  Furthermore, his sins might lead him into\noutright disbelief in which case no one’s intercession will benefit him.  Lastly,\nhe might receive punishment before he is interceded for and released.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe word Khaleel indicates the purest, highe"

Yes.  [We\nare] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips!” (Quran 75:3-4)\nOnce the initial shock of being returned to life begins\nto wear off, the reality of the situation begins to set in.  The veil of the\nphysical world has been removed.  The deeds we did are set out for us to see.\n“So\nwhoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.  And whoever does an atom’s\nweight of evil will see it.”\n(Quran 99:7, 8)\nAnother promise of\nAllah’s fulfilled.  Some people are happy with their situation others begin to\ntremble in fear.\nA person’s deeds will determine their length of the\nstanding but all people waiting will be  barefoot, naked, and uncircumcised.\nAhadith\ntell us that this standing in fear and trepidation could be as long as 50,000\nyears\n[1]\nbut for a\npious person it might be as little as the time it takes to pray two\nrakahs\nof prayer.  The people waiting will be frightened, their hearts beating like\ndrums in their chests and ears.  They will run about as if in a drunken state\nand care nothing about anyone but themselves.  Parents, spouses and children\nwill be long forgotten.  Gripped by fear they will begin to question their\nsituation.\n“He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind,\nwhile I had sight (before)?’ [Allah] will say, ‘This is how it is: Our signs came\nunto you, but you disregarded them, and thus will you this Day be forgotten.’”\n(Quran 20:125)\nProphet Muhammad informs us that on the Day of Judgement\nthe sun will be bought near to humankind.  The sun would only be a mile away\nand the peopl"

Raise your head; ask, for it will be\ngiven to you, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.’ I will\nraise my head and say, ‘My\nUmmah\n, O Lord! My\nUmmah\n, O Lord!’ …”\n[2]\nThis is what is known as the greatest\nintercession, it is\nal-maqaam al-mahmood\n, Prophet Muhammad\nintercedes for the people that Allah might relieve them of the horrors and\nbegin the judgement.\n“...  so that your Lord may raise you to\nMaqaam\nMahmood\n(a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on\nthe Day of Resurrection)” (Quran 17:79)\nHell and Paradise are bought close.\nBefore Judgement commences however,\nHell must be bought forth.  The angels and all of humanity are standing,\nwaiting, becoming increasingly distressed, worried only about themselves,\npleading for help and Hell is brought close.  The people are already distressed\nto the point of hysteria but those who a"

In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nSirat\n-  means path or road. In\nreference to the Day of Judgement, it refers to a long\nnarrow bridge that everyone will cross before entering either Paradise or Hell.\n·\nSunnah\n-  The word\nSunnah\nhas\nseveral meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is\ngenerally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or\napproved.\nYour new everlasting life is about to begin.  This is\nthe Day of Judgment.  All of humanity will be judged by Allah according to\ntheir beliefs and deeds. This is the culmination of the message of all the\nprophets.  Worship One God and know that you will one day be accountable for\nall that you say and do. This day has arrived. It is a shock, all of humanity are\nstanding together in awe. What happens now?\n“Verily, We have warned you of a near torment, the Day when\nman will see that (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth, and the\ndisbeliever will say: ‘Woe to me! Would that I were dust!’ (Quran 78:40)\nThe Scales of Justice\nThe scales of justice sometimes referred to as the\nbalances or the scale of deeds will be set up and each deed will be weighed and\ntallied.\nNo deed even an atom’s weight will be overlooked whether\nit be the backbiting that was forgotten or the kind word that was said without\nthinking.\n“Whoever brings a good deed shall be rewarded ten times the\nlike of it, and he that does evil shall only be rewarded the like of it, and\nthey shall not be wronged.” (Quran 6:160).\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, also reminded us of the mercy of Allah. He said, ‘There is nothing\nthat will be placed in the Balance that will weigh more heavily than a good conduct.\nThe one who has a good conduct will attain thereby the status of one who fasts\nand prays (a great deal).’\n[1]\nThe Book of Deeds\n‘…Woe to us! what sort of book is this that leaves\nneither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!’ and\nthey will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no\none with injustice. (Quran 18:49)\nEach person will be given a book in either their right\nor left hand. Everything we do in this world has been recorded by angels. The\ngood and the bad, things we have forgotten or never given a thought to, it is\nall recorded and Allah might choose to question us about each and every word.\nThose who are given the book in their right hand will begin to relax and feel\nhappy and honoured.\n“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right\nhand, He surely, will receive an easy reckoning, And will return to his family\nin joy!” But whosoever is given his Record behind his back He will invoke (for\nhis) destruction, And he shall enter a blazing Fire”(Quran 84:7-12)\nSadly though, many will receive their book in their\nleft hand or behind their back. And the fear rises.\nThe Accounting\nThe first thing that each person will be questioned\nabout is his prayer.Prayer is what is known as one of the rights we owe\nto Allah. Each person will be asked about the quality of their prayers. This is\nconfirmed and reinforced by the words of Prophet Muhammad.\nIt is recorded in an authentic\nhadith\nthat\nProphet Muhammad said, “The first thing the people will be held accountable for\non the Day of Judgment is prayer, Allah will say to His angels (even though He\nalready knows), ‘Look at my slave’s prayers. Were they complete or not?’ If\nthey were complete it will be written as complete. If they were not fully\ncomplete Allah will say: ‘See if my slave has voluntary prayers’, if he has\nthem Allah will say, ‘Complete the shortage in his obligatory prayers with his\nvoluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same\nmanner.”\n[2]\nThe words of Prophet Muhammad help us to paint a very\nclear picture in our minds of what will happen to us when we stand before Allah\non the Day of Accounting. He also said, “The son of Adam will be questioned by\nAllah about five things: how he lived his life, and how he utilized his youth, by\nwhat means did he earn his wealth, how did he spend his wealth, and what did he\ndo with his knowledge.”\n[3]\nWe should be grateful that we are able to prepare\nourselves adequately before the great Day occurs, as we even know the type of\nquestions that we will be asked and the types of behavior that we will be\nquestioned about.  The good believer prepares for this difficult event, so that\nhe or she will not be among those whose body parts testify against them.\nOn the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their\nfeet will bear witness against them as to their actions.” (Quran 24:24)\n“And they will say to their skin, ‘Why did you bear witness\nagainst us?’ They"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To understand that the grave is the first\nstage of the life in the Hereafter.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nHadith\n- (plural – ahadith) is a\npiece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nSahabah\n- the plural form of \nSahabi\n,\nwhich translates to Companions.   A sahabi, as the word is commonly used today,\nis someone who saw Prophet Muhammad, believed in him and died as a Muslim.\n·\nBarzakh\n- intermediate stage between\nthis life and resurrection.\n·\nGhayb\n- the unseen, the invisible, or\nthe unknown.\nThe grave is the abode of the\nbody after death and death is something we will all experience.  There is no\ndenying this or hiding from it.  Death will come to each and every one of us.  Some\nwill die earlier in their lifespan than others, according to the will of Allah\nbut everyone who lives will die at his appointed time, whether he is amongst\nthe pious or wicked.  Therefore it is important that each and every one of us\nunderstands what will happen after we die.  We die and we are buried but that\nis not the end, on the contrary it is just the beginning.\n“Every soul shall taste death...” (Quran 3:185)\nThe prophets of Allah called their people to worship One\nGod, Allah the Almighty, and they also taught the people to believe in life\nafter death.  It was thought of as an extremely important concept, so much so\nthat failure to believe in it rendered all beliefs meaningless.  In accordance\nwith this, one of the 'pillars of faith' is belief in life after death.  This\nlife is often referred to as the Hereafter, and the first stage of the Hereafter\nis life in the grave.\nIn an authentic\nhadith\nProphet Muhammad said, “The\ngrave is the first stage of the Hereafter …”\n[1]\nWith this in mind it is important to remember that this worldly life is a\nseries of trials and tests that determine our place in the Hereafter.  All\nactions are recorded and they form the basis of any punishment or reward a\nperson is destined to receive.\n“This is because of that (evil) which your hands have sent\nbefore you.  And certainly, Allah is never unjust to (His) slaves.” (Quran 3:182)\n“This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit\nbecause of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world).” (Quran 43:72)\nLife in the grave is often referred to as life in the\nBarzakh\n.\nBarzakh\nliterally means an obstacle, hindrance or\nsomething that separates one thing from another such as this following\ndescription in the Quran:\n“He has let loosed the two seas (the salt water and the sweet)\nmeeting together. Between them is a barrier (\nBarzakh\n), which none of\nthem can transgress.” (Quran 55:19-20)\nAs such it is a barrier that cannot be crossed except by\nthe permission of Allah.  In the context of life and death,\nBarzakh\nis the\nperiod between a person's death and his resurrection on Judgment Day.  The very\nnature of life in the\nBarzakh\nis a matter of the\nghayb\nand thus its\ndetails are known to Allah alone.  However Allah did reveal some matters of the\nghayb\nto Prophet Muhammad and he in turn conveyed those things to us.\nAfter any burial Prophet Muhammad would remind his\ncompanions to ask forgiveness for their brother or sister, and to ask Allah\nthat they remain steadfast at the time of questioning.\n[2]\nThis was\nbecause Prophet Muhammad said that what comes after the burial could be very\ndifficult indeed.   After informing his\nsahabi\nthat the grave is the\nfirst stage of the Hereafter, Prophet Muhammad said, “…if one finds salvation\n(at this stage) the succeeding (stages) become easy for him, and if he does not\nfind salvation in it, what follows this stage is very hard upon him.” Prophet\nMuhammad’s beloved wife Aisha recalls that the Prophet used to regularly seek\nrefuge with Allah from the torment and tribulations of the grave.\n[3]\nAnd it is\nunderstood by the scholars of Islam that the tribulations refer to the\nquestioning.\nThus it would be pertinent for us to follow his example\nand seek refuge with Allah from being punished in the grave.  Prophet Muhammad himself,\nin a relatively long but very descriptive and informative\nhadith\nexplains\nvery clearly what will happen before the questioning.  It was a subject that\nthe\nsahabah\nwere very interested in and they describe themselves as\nsitting like birds, meaning they were quiet and still, when listening to\nProphet Muhammad talk about the life in the grave.\n[4]\n“\nWhen the believing\nslave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to\nhim angels with white faces like the sun, and they sit around him as far as the\neye can see.  They bring with them shrouds from Jannah (Heavenly Abode) and\nperfumes from Jannah.  Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and\nhe says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure.’\nThen it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a water-skin.  When\nhe seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant bef"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To understand the nature of the questions\nasked in the grave.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nHadith\n- (plural – ahadith) is a\npiece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah\nbe upon him, and his companions.\nThe scene for the disbelievers\nis very different.  The angels come to a disbeliever “…with dark faces,\nbringing sackcloth, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see.  Then\nthe Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O evil soul, come\nforth to the wrath of Allah and His anger.’  Then his soul disperses inside his\nbody, and then comes out cutting the veins and nerves, like a skewer passing\nthrough wet wool.  When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an\ninstant before they take it and put it in that sackcloth, and there comes from\nit a stench like the foulest stench of a dead body on the face of the earth.  Then\nthey ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is\nthis evil soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so’, calling\nhim by the worst names by which he was known in this world, until they reach\nthe lowest heaven.  They ask for it to be opened to them and it is not opened.”\n Then Allah records his place as being in the lowest depths of hell.\nOnce the soul has been reunited with the body, the dead\nperson is visited in their grave by two angels.   In an authentic\nhadith\nProphet Muhammad tells us that these angels are black and blue and named Munkar\nand Nakeer.  The angels will ask three questions that will affirm a person’s\nfaith and at the same time lay bare their piousness or wickedness.  This is a\nvery important stage because it sets the scene for the whole of a person’s life\nin the Hereafter.  The angels ask who is your Lord, what is your religion and\nwho is your Prophet? Or as in some\nahadith\nit is said that the question\nwill be who is this man who was sent amongst you?  As you can see these\nquestions concern matters of faith\n.\nIf a person answers, my Lord is\nAllah, my religion is Islam, my prophet is Muhammad … a voice calls out from\nheaven, “My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and\nclothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.” If the deceased\ndoes not know the correct answer to the questions, then a voice calls out from\nheaven, “Prepare for him a bed from Hell and clothe him from Hell, and open for\nhim a gate to Hell.  ”\nThe questioning confirms exactly what a person has\nunderstood since the moment of death.  Good really will be rewarded and evil\nwill be punished.  And thus the believer is immediately rewarded with an\nopening that appears in his grave.  Through the opening the person can see the\ngrandeur and bounties waiting for him in Paradise.  His good deeds will come to\nhim in the form of a well-dressed, handsome , finely perfumed man.  The grave\nwill be widened as far as the eye can see, it will be well-lit and filled with\ngreenery; he will long to tell his family of his good fortune.  The believer\nwill sleep peacefully in his grave.  Prophet Muhammad mentioned in a\nhadith\nthat the believer will be told to look at his place in the Hellfire and\nunderstand that it has been exchanged for a place in Paradise.  “So he will\nlook at them both.  Then his grave will be widened for him to a distance of\nseventy cubits, and it will be filled with greenery until the Day of\nResurrection”.\nIn contrast, grave of the disobedient will be filled\nwith darkness.  The disbeliever’s punishment begins with his bad deeds taking\nthe form of a repulsive looking man and an opening through which he can see the\nugliness of Hell.\nReward and punishment are mighty motivators and the\nthought of spending an unspecified amount of time being punished even before\nthe Day of Judgment arrives is a fearful thing.\nThe Prophet said “When any one of you dies, he is shown\nhis eternal abode every morning and evening.  If he is one of the people of\nParadise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the\npeople of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is\nyour abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”\nImagine hearing those words.  This is your abode until\nAllah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.  This is a moment that could\neither be filled with joy or despair for the time may be long or short, as\nAllah wills.  We have been warned and events of that day have been clearly set\nout for us.  Those of us who are wise will take heed."

the shade of the Throne of Allah.  In these\nlessons we will examine these groups of people in more detail.\nProphet Muhammad would talk to his followers about the\nDay of Judgment.  He wanted them, and us who follow him today, to be prepared\nfor what is to come.  In a famous and much quoted\nhadith\nhe reminded us\nof the boundless mercy of Allah and seven types of people who would stand\nserenely in the shade on the Day of Judgement.\n“Allah will give shade to seven [people] on the Day when\nthere will be no shade other than His (Throne's) shade:  A just ruler; a youth\nwho grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the\nmosques; two who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for that and parting\nupon that; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for illegal\nintercourse), but responds by saying, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in\ncharity and hides it, such that his left hand does not know what his right hand\ngives in charity; and finally  a man who remembered Allah in private and wept.”\n[3]\nBefore we continue, it is worth mentioning that in most\ncircumstances when ‘man’ is mentioned both in the Quran and\nahadith\nit\nrefers to both men and women; except where women or men are addressed\nseparately and specifically.\n1.A just ruler.\nJustice is a fundamental concept in Islam, along with\ntolerance, forgiveness and respect.   Justice means to give every person the\nrights he is entitled to believer or non-believer, relative or stranger, friend\nor enemy.  This is a concept that every Muslim must apply, not only the ruler. \nGod emphasizes justice, and Islam condemns all forms of injustice and\noppression.\n“…And do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being\njust.  Be just; that is nearer to righteousness”.    (Quran: 5:8)\n“…And God wills no injustice to the worlds.” (Quran 3:108)\nBeing just can put the ruler under a lot of pressure, he\nmust be careful of his own intentions and actions and he also bears some responsibility\nfor the actions taken under his authority.\n2.A youth who grew up in the worship of Allah.\nIt is the youth who are the most energetic and\nenthusiastic.  They have a zest for life and look to the future, planning and\nlaying foundations for a long and fruitful life.  Their liveliness and zeal are\ngreat blessings from Allah and those who use this time wisely to gain knowledge\nof Allah and perform acts that they may not be able to perform later in life\nwill be rewarded.  Amongst those rewards is to be shaded on the Day when there\nis no shade.  Youthfulness however is also the time when a person is most\nvulnerable to the temptations of life and the tricks of\nShaytan\n.  There\nare many worldly distractions specifically marketed to the young, so they must\nkeep their eyes on the prize and not be deluded by all that glitters and has no\nsubstance.\nWe are reminded of this in another\nhadith\nwhere Prophet\nMuhammad says, “Take advantage of five matters before five other matters: your\nyouth\nbefore you become old; and your health, before you fall sick; and your wealth,\nbefore you become poor; and your free time before you become busy; and your\nlife, before your death.”\n[4]\n3.A man whose heart is attached to the mosques.\nOnce again there are great rewards for praying in the\nmosque.  In various\nahadith\nwe are reminded of this.  For a man praying\nin the mosque has 27 times more reward than praying in the home.\n[5]\nProphet\nMuhammad said that a person… “does not take a step towards the mosque except\nthat because of it, he is raised by one rank and one sin is removed from him.  Then\nwhen he prays, the angels do not ceas"

Verily, Paradise will\nbe his abode.” (Quran 79:40-41)\nPeople enter Paradise, due generally to their\ntaqwa\nof Allah, full respect and obedience to the commands of Allah, and based on\ntheir good conduct.  Most however enter the Hellfire because of the ill use of\nthe mouth and private parts”.\n[1]\nSomething that is guaranteed to strengthen our resolve\nto stay well away from the temptation of the opposite gender is ‘fear of Allah’.\nTaqwa\nis the word often used to define the concept of fear of Allah.  Prophet\nYusuf (Joseph) was a man with\ntaqwa\n.  It is said that he will be one of\nthe leaders of the people shaded by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  His way of\ndealing with the temptation of the seductress that was his employer’s wife is a\nfine example for all of us.  When he found himself tempted by her beauty he\nsought refuge with Allah.\n“Indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her\ndesire had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.   Thus, it was that We might\nturn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse.   Surely, he was one of\nOur chosen, guided slaves.” (Quran 12:24)\n6.    A man who gives in charity and hides it,\nsuch that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity.\nCharity in Islam takes two forms:\nzakah\n, compulsory\ncharity and\nsadaqah\n, voluntary charity.\nZakah\nholds such a high\nposition that throughout the Quran it is often coupled with prayer.  Islam\nplaces great emphasis on the need to give\nsadaqah\nand\nzakah\nand\nit places great emphasis and great reward on giving these two forms of charity\nin secret.  To give in secret preserves the dignity of those who receive and it\nalso prevents the giver from seeking praise and acknowledgment.  Islam tells us\nthat giving in secret is by far the superior way but that should not detract\nfrom giving publicly which is also a very desirous and rewardable act however\ndeliberately drawing attention to one’s charitable deeds is a very undesirable\nquality.\nWealth is something that Allah can give to us at any time;\nhowever He can also take it away without even a moment’s notice.  We all know\npeople that have plunged into bankruptcy overnight.  Because of the high\nposition charity holds in Islam it is important that we spend our wealth in the\nway of Allah before we do not have the means to do so.\nThe likeness of those who spend their money for Allah’s sake,\nis as the likeness of a grain (of corn), it grows seven ears, every single ear\nhas a hundred grains, and God multiplies (increases the reward) for whom He\nwills, and Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All Knower.  (Quran\n2:261)\n7.    A man who remembers Allah in private and\nweeps.\nProphet Muhammad said, “There are two eyes which will\nnot be touched by the fire, an eye which weeps out of fear of Allah and an eye\nthat stays alert throughout the night guarding for the sake of Allah”.\n[2]\nIn the first type are those people whose eyes overflow\nwith tears when they remember Allah.  They weep when they contemplate the sins\nthat"

Adam\nAllah favored Adam (Quran 3:33) over\nother people with some great qualities:\n1.Adam was the father of all human beings.  Allah chose him to be\nthe father of all human beings as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of\nAllah be upon him, said, “All of you are the children of Adam and Adam was\ncreated from soil.”\n[1]\n2.Allah created Adam with His Hands.  Addressing Satan, Allah\nsaid, “What prevented you from prostrating yourself to the one whom I created\nwith both My hands?” (Quran 38:75).\n3.Allah created the soul breathed into Adam.  Allah had His angel,\nGabriel, breathe life into him (Quran 15:29, 38:72).\n4.Allah had the angels prostrate to Adam (Quran 15:29, 38:72).\n5.Allah gave him great amount of knowledge, surpassing what He\ngave to the angels (Quran 2:31).\n6.Allah gave him residence in Paradise along with his wife, Eve,\nand allowed them to enjoy there (Quran 2:35).\n7.Adam was the first Prophet to human beings.  Prophet Muhammad said,\n“…Adam was a Prophet and received revelation.”\n[2]\n8.Adam shared one religion with all other Prophets and called to\nthe same religion, Islam.  They all invited to belief in Allah and worshipping\nAllah alone (Quran 21:25, 16:36).\nCreation of Adam\nAllah told the angels that He was planning to establish\na ‘khalifah’\n[3]\non\nEarth.  ‘Khalifah’ is a person who is succeeded by others.  They immediately\nunderstood that it would not be Adam alone who will live on Earth, but rather,\nit would be a long chain of human beings, many of them will be wicked:\n“And (mention, O Muhammad), when your Lord said to the angels,\n‘Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.’ They said, ‘Will\nYou place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we\ndeclare Your praise and sanctify You?’ Allah said, ‘Indeed, I know that which\nyou do not know.’” (Quran 2:31)\nThe question by the angels was not meant to question\nAllah’s wisdom or a result of envy or hatred for humans.  They simply wanted to\nunderstand the purpose of Adam’s creation.  Allah’s response tells us that in\nHis perfect knowledge, He knew things about Adam that the angels could not\nimagine.\nThe angels feared that Adam was unworthy of becoming a\nkhalifah\non Earth, Allah\nproved to them that it was incorrect and the new creation can surpass them in\nknowledge.  The Quran 2:31-33 recounts that Allah taught Adam names of all\ncreated things that the angels did not know.  Allah emphasized to them that\ntheir knowledge is limited and they could only know what He taught them.  When\nAdam defeated the angels in the ‘contest of knowledge,’ he earned their respect. \nThus, they rushed to prostrate to Adam when commanded by Allah.\nMore On the Creation of Adam\nAllah tells us in the Quran 20:55 and 30:20 that He\ncreated us from soil.  Allah gathered different types and colors of soil from\nwhich Adam was to be created.  The Prophet said, ‘Indeed, Adam was created from\nthree types of solids: black, white, and red.’\n[4]\nThe soil gathered for Adam’s creation was then turned\ninto clay as mentioned in the Quran 6:2.  The clay was sticky (Quran 37:11).  After\nAdam’s clay dried, it became sort of like pottery, making a sound when tapped\n(Quran 15:26).\nAfter forming Adam’s clay, Allah fashioned it and set it\nin Paradise for a certain duration before He gave it life.  “Satan started\ncircling the clay, examining its nature.  When he realized it was hollow, he\nthought, ‘I’ll conquer this, for it is a creation that cannot hold together.’\n‘Cannot hold together’ means that he cannot control himself against desires.\nAdam was much larger in size than what human beings are today. \nThe Prophet said, ‘Allah created Adam sixty cubits tall, then mankind kept\ngetting shorter until (it reached a stable height) now.’ (Bukhari, Muslim)\nThus, human beings did not go through stages of evolution.\nIn several verses of the Quran (2:117, 3:47, 6:73,\n16:40, 19:35, 36:82.  40:68), Allah indicates that He brings into existence\nwith a mere word or command.  Sometimes, instead of fulfilling His command\ndirectly, Allah creates means for fulfilling them.  For people, Allah sends\nangels to breathe life into them.  In the case of Adam and Jesus, Allah sent Gabriel\nto breathe life into them (Quran 15:29, 38:72).\nLife was blown into Adam on Friday.  The Prophet said,\n‘Indeed, among your best days is Friday.  On it, Adam was created, and on it he\ndied.  Also, on it will be the Blow of the Horn and the Shock causing every"

he was a\njinn\nbut lived among the angels. \nInstead of showing remorse and repenting for his behavior, Allah says,\n“So they (the angels) prostrated themselves, except for\nIblees\n,\nwho refused, was arrogant, and (thus) became of the disbelievers.” (Quran 2:34)\nAllah gave him a chance to repent; however,\nIblees\nwent deeper into disobedience and rebellion.  To justify his arrogance, Satan\nsaid that he was better than Adam because fire is better than clay.\nAllah expelled\nIblees\nfrom Paradise as punishment.\nIblees\nrecognized that he deserved immediate\npunishment for his outright disbelief and disobedience, but he requested that\nhis punishment be postponed until Judgement Day.  Allah granted his request for\na great wisdom.\nIblees\nannounced his evil plan to mislead humanity. \nHe announced boastfully to Allah,\n“(\nIblees\n) said, ‘Because You have put me in error, I\nwill surely lie in ambush for them (humans) along Your straight path.  I will\nthen surely assault them from before them and from behind them and from their\nright and from their left, and You will find most of them ungrateful (to\nYou).’” (Quran 7:16-17)\nIblees\nblamed Allah for his misfortune, even\nthough Allah did not take away his freedom of choice.  Allah’s wisdom dictated\nthat\nIblees\nbe the trial ‘machine’ for human beings and he was given\nextraordinary powers over human beings, but it’s limitation is that he will not\nbe able to subdue Allah’s true servants.\nAllah permitted\nIblees\nto pursue his plan.  Once he has\ncompleted his evil scheme, he will abide in Hell with his followers from the\njinn\nand human beings (Quran 7:18).\nAdam and Hawwa in Paradise\nAllah let Adam and Eve dwell in Paradise, the best\nresidence.  He gave them permission to enjoy its bounties without restriction. \nHowever, Allah prohibited them from eating one specific fruit,\n“We said, ‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and\neat therefrom in abundance from wherever you wish.  But do not approach this\nvery tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.’” (Quran 2:35)\nSoon after Adam and Hawwa started living in Paradise,\nSatan unleashed his cunning deception on them.  The two were innocent and did\nnot know about lying and deception.  Satan took a false oath by Allah and used\ntheir innocence to his advantage.  Satan suggested to them that they could be\nlike the angels or live eternally in Paradise.  Adam and Hawwa were overcome\nwith desire and fell into Satan’s trick and ate from the forbidden tree.  As\nsoon as they did, their private parts became exposed (Quran 2:36).An\nimmediate outcome of disobedience is the stripping away of the spiritual\nclothing of\ntaqwa\n, hence they were punished by losing the physical\ngarments that covered their private parts.\nThey were punished by losing the physical garments that\ncovered their private"

Allah, the Exalted, says:\n“And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our\nInspiration and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are\nsurely to be drowned.” (Quran11:37)\nWhen the water started to fall from the sky and gush\nfrom the earth, for this was no ordinary storm, Allah commanded Nuh to enter\nthe ark with his family, the believers and a pair of every known animal, bird\nor insect.  The disbelievers watched incredulously, still jeering and mocking,\nbut the words stuck in their throats when the water began to rise, and rise,\nand rise.\nLesson 2\nThere is no power and strength except from Allah.  He is the All-Powerful. \nIf He decrees a thing, nothing can prevent it.\nWhile worldly might, strength or respect might seem of\nconsequence, the reality is that we are weak and needy; what little control we\nhave over our world and our affairs pales in comparison to the might and\nmajesty of Allah.\nNuh’s wife did not join him on the ark, for she had\nnever really believed in the message he had been preaching for so long.   Neither\ndid his eldest son, an idol worshiper who preferred to climb the highest\nmountain he could find, but the water kept rising and rising.  Prophet Nuh\ncould see his son being overtaken by the waves of water and cried out to him to\nembark the ark.   But his son refused, and he drowned.\n“And Nuh called out to his son, who had separated himself\n(apart), ‘O my son!  Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.’  The son\nreplied, ‘I will betake myself to a mountain; it will save me from the water.’ \nNuh said: ‘Today there is no refuge from Allah’s command, except for those on\nwhom He has mercy.’  And a wave came in between them so he (the son) was among\nthe drowned.” (Quran 11:42-43)\nThe examples of Nuh’s interactions with his idolatrous\nson and non-believing wife confirm the previous lessons and add a third lesson.\nLesson 3\nWe choose what we want to believe and how we want to act.\nAlthough we are undoubtedly born with an innate need to\nconnect with Allah, our spiritual identity is not a forgone conclusion.  We all\nreach an age when we can choose our faith, no matter what religion we were born\ninto.  Once chosen we then live with the consequences of that decision.\nOn his deathbed Nuh called his remaining sons to his\nside and counseled them.\n‘Indeed I would give you far reaching advice.  I charge\nyou to believe that there is no true god but Allah and that if the seven\nheavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale and the words “there\nis no true god but Allah “ were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the\nformer.  I warn you against associating partners with God and against arrogance.”\n[1]\nThe large majority of Nuh’s people rejected his message,\nbut the message survives in t"

You bring forth the dead by My leave.” (Quran 5:10)\nA miracle performed by Allah at the request of Prophet\nJesus explains why Islam says that there are two types of miracles.  Jesus\nasked Allah to provide him and his disciples with a table of food.  This event\nis discussed in\nSurah\n5 of the Quran entitled Al-Maidah (The Table Spread). \nIt is an example of a miracle performed at the request, or suggestion of the\npeople, in order to test the truth of the message.\n“Jesus, son of Mary!  Can your Lord send down to us a table\nspread (with food) from heaven?” (Quran 5:112)\nThe disciples wanted to spread the message of Jesus by\nproclaiming the miracles they witnessed with their own eyes.  Another example\nof this type of miracle is when Prophet Saleh’s people requested he bring out\nfrom behind the mountain a she-camel and her offspring.\n“We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did\nher wrong.” (Quran 17:59)\nThe second type of miracle occurs without suggestion.  It\nincludes anything similar to what happened when the tree trunk cried and longed\nfor Prophet Muhammad.   The\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad contains many\nother miracles such as water flowing from his (Prophet Muhammad’s) fingers and\ntrees deliberating shading him.  Prophet (King) Solomon’s life was also filled\nwith miracles and wonder.  His kingdom and his abilities were beyond the\ncapabilities of a human thus clearly showing that God provided him with\nmiracles that made him stand out among others and confirmed his nobility and\nprophethood.   His army consisted of battalions of men,\njinn\nand birds."

Allah\ndescribes him as such, He says:\nIndeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly\nobedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who\nassociate others with Allah. (He was) thankful for His (Allah's) Graces. He\n(Allah) chose him and guided him to a Straight Path. And We gave him good in\nthis world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. (Quran\n16: 120-122)\nLesson 1\nParents can learn from their children and elders can learn\nfrom the youth.\nKnowledge and understanding is not necessarily something\nthat comes with age and just because a person is older does not mean that he or\nshe is someone to emulate. The way Prophet Ibrahim interacted with his father\nis a very good example of a child respecting his parent yet rejecting his (the\nparent’s) ways and lifestyle.\nAnd (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father, Azar: “Do you\ntake idols as gods? Verily, I see you and your people in manifest error!” (Quran\n6: 74)\nIbrahim’s father Azar was a sculptor of idols, so from a\nyoung age Ibrahim was aware that idols were nothing more than pieces of wood or\nstone – inanimate objects that could extend no benefit or harm. He found it\nextraordinary that people would worship them as gods!\nIbrahim tried to convince his father that his practice\nof idol worship was wrong and ultimately useless. He  spoke to him in a gentle\nvoice, using kind words, and he tried to warn him of the dangers inherent in\nworshipping idols, but his father only became annoyed and then angry.\nWhen he said to his father: O my father! Why do you\nworship that which cannot hear or see and cannot avail you in anything? O my\nfather! Verily! I have received knowledge that you have not received, so follow\nme. I will guide you to a Straight Path. O my father, do not worship Satan.\nIndeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient. O my father,\nindeed I fear that you will be punished by the Most Merciful and would be a\ncompanion to Satan in Hellfire. He (the father) said: Do you reject\nmy gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop this, I will indeed stone you. So get\naway from me safely before I punish you. (Quran 19: 42-46)\nThe child feared that his father would be lost and fall\ninto the clutches of\nShaytan\n. He was wise beyond his years yet Ibrahim’s\nfather did not listen perhaps rejecting the fact that his child could guide and\nteach him. Ibrahim did not lose his temper but instead responded to his\nfather’s threatening attitude with respect and wisdom.\n[Abraham] said, Peace be upon you. I will implore my\nLord to forgive you. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me. And I shall turn away\nfrom you and from those whom you invoke besides Allah. I will call upon my Lord\nand it may well be that, in calling on my Lord, I will not be disappointed.” (Quran\n19:47-48)\nLesson 2\nIslam is logical.\nFrom the perspective of Islam Prophet Ibrahim is not\nconsidered to be either Jewish or a Christian; he is a Prophet who submitted to\nAllah and thus is a Muslim. God tells us in the Quran that from an early age Prophet\nIbrahim felt compelled to find the One God Who was worthy of worship. He\nrealized that the idols his people worshipped, that were carved and sculptured\nby his father were nothing but wood and stone. He knew instinctively that the\nsun, moon and stars were not gods of any sort. Islam tells us that worshipping\nAllah is the only logical conclusion that a person who examines the evidence,\ncan come to.  This is exactly what Ibrahim did. First he asked the wooden idols\nto respond when he spoke to them and he then destroyed them. They could not speak\nor protect themselves. Next he looked to the heavens and tried to find an\nanswer.\nSo when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star.\nHe said, This is my lord! But when it was no longer visible, he\nsaid, I do not like those that disappear! When he saw the moon\nrising, he said: This is my lord. But when it was no longer visible,\nhe said: Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the people who\nwent astray. When he saw the sun rising, he said: This is my lord.\nThis is greater. But when it set, he said: O my people! I disown\nall"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To examine several events and learn valuable\nlessons applicable in the 21st century.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nLut\n- the Arabic name of Prophet Lot.\nMany stories in the Quran\ndemonstrate the nature of Allah, some sections teach us about Paradise and Hell\nand still other parts of Quran teach us lessons. These lessons are as relevant\ntoday as they were in the time Quran was revealed or even further back in the\nhistory of humankind.  The story of Prophet Lot in both the Bible and the Quran\nare remarkably similar. The story of Prophet Lut is one that is particularly\npertinent to the 21st century yet people usually remember very little of the\nstory.\nThe story of Lut has over the centuries been reduced to\na morality tale, a parable warning people not to practice homosexuality. \nUsually all we hear is that Lut was a man of Allah living in the town of Sodom whose\npeople practiced the unnatural act of homosexuality, Allah called such\nbehaviour an abomination and destroyed the town but not before saving Lut and most\nof his family.  However Lut’s story is much more than that, it is a story\nfilled with lessons for humankind. Let us take a glimpse into his life and see\nwhat messages we are able to find and learn from it.\nLesson 1\nAllah destroyed Sodom for crimes and sins we see around us\nand accept every day.\nWe live in a world where murder is common, drugs are\nreadily available and young girls fall pregnant outside of the bonds of\nmarriage. Identities are stolen, sinful acts are called fun, and some streets\nare unsafe to walk down even in the middle of the day. Paedophilia is rampant,\nas is child pornography and human trafficking.  Degenerate lifestyles are\naccepted and thought of as normal. Alcohol is easily available even to underage\nchildren and is responsible for many of society’s ills. The people of Prophet\nLut lived in a society very similar to our own.\nThe town of Sodom was corrupt through and through. The\nmajority of people had no shame and considered sinful acts to be fun and\nfrivolity. Sodom was a party town, criminals and criminal activity abounded,\nand those passing through the town risked robbery and physical abuse. Rape was\nconsidered normal, homosexuality was considered fun and travellers expecting\nhospitality usually got more than they bargained for. Sodom was the equivalent\nof the district we avoid at night, perhaps even the suburb police will not\nrespond to in an emergency.\nLesson 2\nTo invite people to the truth with wisdom and kind words.\n“Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom  and fair\npreaching, and argue with them in a way that is better...” (Quran 16:125)\nAllah sent Prophet Lot to this town with the message to\nworship Allah alone.  He asked them to fear Allah and mend their evil ways\nsaying,\n“Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?  Verily!  I am a trustworthy\nMessenger to you.  So fear Allah and obey me” (Quran 26:161 - 163).\nLot\nspoke using mild words; he condemned the actions not the people themselves and\nencouraged them to seek forgiveness. There is surely a lesson for us in this.\nLot spoke mildly to people Allah described as evil and disobedient, thus we\nshould remember this when we are confronted with the evil acts people in the 21\nst\ncentury think of as fun. Condemn the act, not the person.  This was also the\nway of Prophet Muhammad; he too would speak harshly about the action, not about\nthe person who did the action.\nLesson 3\nAllah is the All-Seeing.\nSadly however, in Sodom, Lut’s words fell on deaf ears\nbecause the people were content with their corrupt ways and had no desire to\ncurb them.  The people of Sodom committed their sins openly and had no shame,\nthey cared not whether anyone saw their sinful actions so it did not bother\nthem that Allah was watching. No matter whether we try to disguise or hide our\nsins Allah sees everything, nothing can be hidden from the Almighty. Thus if we\nare ashamed of our actions and wish that Allah did not witness our behaviour it\nis  probably time to rethink,  and  find a way to act that is more pleasing to Allah.\nLesson 4\nBelievers should be hospitable.\nWhen the angels came into the town of Sodom they\nappeared to the people as very attractive male travellers. The first person they\nspoke to was one of Lut’s daughters. She was afraid for them and asked that\nthey wait for her father in order for him to see them to safety. When Lut met\nthe strangers he could not convince them to bypass the town so he tried to keep\nthem safe in his own home.  Lut did not know that his guests were angels sent\nby Allah, yet he feared for them more than his own safety. When the men of\nSodom rioted outside his house, demanding that the strangers be delivered into\ntheir hands, Lut opposed them.\nThe goodness in hospitality comes from giving for no\nother reason than to please Allah. The person you help may never be in a\nposition to help you and in some cases he may even bring you harm, however in\nIslam hospitality is a triangular relationship between the host, the stranger\nan"

One amongst them\nhowever felt the error of their ways and suggested that rather than killing\nYusuf\n,\nthey should cast him into a well.  When found by some passing traveller he\nwould be sold into slavery, thus rendering him as good as dead to the family.  They\nalso believed, in their blindness, that the absence of Yusuf would remove him\nfrom their father’s thoughts.\nAllah had other plans, so while the brothers\ncongratulated themselves, He established Yusuf  in the land of Egypt in order\nto teach him wisdom and understanding.  The pain and suffering Yusuf felt being\nseparated from his father and the frightening ordeal of being sold into slavery\nwere trials designed to mould Yusuf’s character.  They were Yusuf’s first steps\non the ladder to greatness and they established him as a Prophet of Allah.  The\nplots and plans of the treacherous brothers were inconsequential.\nLesson 2\nTrue\nsabr\nis a key to the gates of Paradise.\nWhen Yusuf’s brothers returned to their father and told\nhim Yusuf had been taken by a wolf, Yaqub’sheart constricted in pain\nand fear.  He knew his sons were lying but he had no option except to face that\nfear with complete submission to Allah.   He turned to Allah with hope and\npatience.  This type of\nsabr\nis what Islam calls\nsabr jameel -\nbeautiful\nsabr\n.\n“Nay, but your own selves have made up a tale.   So (for me)\npatience is most fitting.   And it is God (Alone) Whose help can be sought\nagainst that which you assert.” (Quran 12:18)\nThroughout the many years until Yaqub saw his dear son Yusuf\nagain, he never gave up hope.  At one time when his sons asked if he would\nweep\nforever\nhe replied that he only complained of his grief and sadness to Allah,\nand that he knew, due to his total reliance on Allah, things that they did not\nknow.\nLesson 3\nComplete trust in Allah must be practiced consistently, in\nall situations, good, bad, easy, or difficult.\nIf we accept that we are no more than slaves of Allah,\nput on this earth, to be tried, tested and tempted, life can take on a\ncompletely new meaning.   Both Yusuf and his father Yaqub recognized that God\nwas the one thing in their lives they could totally rely on.\nDuring his time in the house of one of the top Ministers\nof Egypt Yusuf was forced to fend of the sexual advances of his\nbenefactor/master’s wife.  Yusuf called out to Allah for help.  He said,\n“O my Lord"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To examine several events in the life of\nProphet Ayub and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply\nto our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nAyub\n- the Arabic word for Job.\n·\nSabr\n- patience and it comes from a\nroot word meaning to stop, detain,  or refrain.\n·\nShaytan\n- sometimes spelled\nShaitan\nor\nShaytaan\n.    It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to\ndenote the devil or Satan, the personification of evil.\n·\nJinn\n- A creation of Allah that was\ncreated before humankind from smokeless flame. They are referred to at times as\nspirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.\nThe lives of all the\nProphets of Allah are filled with lessons.  Some lessons are as applicable\ntoday as they were in the era in which they were experienced.  The Prophets\ncame with lessons to be learned and understood, messages, and laws.  Sometimes\nthe laws changed to accommodate a particular time and place but the main\nmessage that they conveyed was the same.  They instructed their peoples to\nworship God alone, and not associate anything or anyone in worship with Him.  The\nstories of the lives of the prophets emphasize this basic doctrine of Islam\nthat God is One.\nThe story of Prophet Ayub is a little different from the\nothers that we know.  Through his story, we are able to view humankind’s\nstruggle on a more personal level.  Allah does not tell us about Job’s methods\nof preaching or how his people reacted to his warnings and admonitions.   God\ndoes not tell us about the fate of Ayub’s people.   Instead, He tells us about Ayub’s\nsabr\n.   He (the Almighty) praises Job by saying,\n“Truly!  We found\nhim patient.   How excellent a slave!  Verily, he was ever oft returning in\nrepentance to Us!” (Quran 38:44)\nLesson 1\nTo have\nsabr\nAt this point you are probably thinking that all the\nProphets we have discussed so far in this series of lessons have demonstrated\nsabr\nand of course you would be correct.   It is one of the most important lessons\nto learn and to practice.  However Allah, the Most-Wise uses Prophet Ayub’s story\nto touch on some areas that otherwise might be overlooked in the study of the\nProphets of Allah and their patience.  Ayub’s story is one of\nsabr\n, no\ndoubt about that, however not patience for minutes, hours, or even days.  Prophet\nAyub was patient for years, literally, with not even the smallest break.  The\nscholars differ about just how many years but it seems that seven is the\nminimum number of years.  Prophet Ayub bore all difficulties with patience.  To\nlearn more about Prophet Ayub’s suffering and unwavering patience, please see:\nhttp://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2721/\nLesson 2\nIs our sincerity and worship of Allah dependent upon His\nblessings on us?\nHappiness and afflictions are both tests from Allah.  We\nface trials and we experience triumphs.  If we remember Allah in our times of triumph,\nwill we still worship with sincerity when we are faced with loss or suffering. \nThis is just what\nShaytan\nintends to find out when he suggests that\nAllah removes Ayub’s blessings of wealth, health and family.   Job was\ncommitted to daily prayer and would frequently thank Allah for blessings He had\nbestowed on him but\nShaytan\nwas convinced that Ayubwould turn\naway from his Lord when he was faced with intense suffering, illness and\ndistress.  Allah knew his faithful slave would never turn away from his faith\nso He allowed\nShaytan\nto afflict Ayub with many calamities one after the\nother.\nAllah makes it very clear that children and wealth are\nmerely adornments of this brief life and that He will test us through our love\nfor them.\nWealth and children are the attractions of this worldly life,\nbut lasting good works have a better reward with your Lord and give better\ngrounds for hope.  (Quran 18:46)\nHe can take the adornments of life away from us as\neasily as He can provide them for us, thus we should never rely on this worldly\nlife, or feel secure.  In the story of Ayub, Allah teaches us that worldly\ntreasures are ultimately worthless; so never allow the adornments of this\nmaterial life to take over your heart nor lose sight of what is important. Do\nnot give preference to the material realm and put aside your worship and\nreverence to your Creator.\nLesson 3\nNothing happens without the Will of Allah.\nAllah used the life of Prophet Ayub to teach\nShaytan\na lesson.   It is a lesson that we too can take benefit from.  The lesson is\nthat Allah is the controller of all affairs.  Human beings,\nJinn\nor\nShaytan\ncan plot, or simply make plans, but none of them will come to fruition\nwithout the permission of Allah.  When you read a more complete story of\nProphet Ayub you will notice that\nShaytan\nknew this and sought\npermission to test Prophet Ayub.\nProphet Ayub understood that whatever calamities befell\nhim, they were happening with the permission of Allah.  He also had complete\ntrust in the Mercy of Allah knowing that if he loved and trusted Allah even\nmore in the t"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To examine several events in the life of\nProphet Musa and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply\nto our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nMusa\n- the Arabic word for Moses.\n·\nSalah\n- the Arabic word to denote a direct\nconnection between the believer and Allah.  More specifically, in Islam it\nrefers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of\nworship.\nOn a dark night in the\nshadow of Mt. Tur, Allah conferred Prophethood on Musa and engaged him in a\nshort but remarkable conversation.  It was a conversation that taught Musa\nlessons about himself, about his world, about the nature of humankind and about\nthe nature of Allah.  To this day it continues to teach important lessons to\nhumankind.  On a daily basis, the words of the Quran change lives.  The lessons\nlearned in the story of Musa are as relevant today as they were thousands of\nyears ago.\nThe story of Musa teaches us the importance of trusting Allah;\nit demonstrates that Allah’s plans will overcome any triumph, test, or trial,\nand it shows us that there is no relief from the torments of this world except with\nremembrance and through seeking nearness to Allah.  Reading and studying the\nlife of Musa reveals that Allah can replace weakness with strength and failure\nwith victory; and that Allah supports the righteous from sources we can barely\nimagine.\nEgypt in the lifetime of Musa was the known world’s\nsuperpower.  Wealth and power were in the hands of very few, and the lives and\nlifestyles of the majority were of very little consequence.  The political\nsituation was in some ways similar to the political world of the 21st century. \nIn a time when the young people of the world are used as cannon fodder for the\npolitical and military games of the most powerful, the story of Musa is\nparticularly pertinent.  It teaches us how to obey the commands of Allah and it\nteaches us how to survive in a world where religion is less important than\npower and acquisition.\nTo read more detailed information about the life of\nProphet Musa go to:\nhttp://www.islamreligion.com/articles/3366/viewall/\nLesson 1\nEstablish the\nsalah.\nMusa had extraordinary strength of character, even as a\nrelatively young man he had developed the ability to persevere even in the direst\ncircumstances.  He had fled Egypt under the threat of death, trudged across the\ndesert and found a new life in a new land but later circumstances pulled him\nback to the land of his birth.  In the dark of the night, in the shadow of a\nmountain the light of a fire drew Musa into an amazing dialogue.  Imagine his\nshock and surprise when he found himself engaged in a conversation with Allah,\nthe Al-Mighty.  After commanding that Musa removes his shoes, Allah reminded\nhim of humankind’s obligation to Him.\n“Verily!  I am Allah!  none has the right to be worshipped but\nI, so worship Me, and establish prayer (\nsalah\n) for My Remembrance.  (Quran\n20: 14)\nIn this conversation\nsalah\nwas prescribed upon Musa\nand his followers.\nSalah\nwas also prescribed upon Prophet Muhammad and\nhis followers in much the same way.  Allah establishes a direct connection\nbetween Himself and Musa before He revealed Musa’s mission to the court of the\npharaoh of Egypt.  Before Allah commands Musa to face his biggest fear He says,\nworship Me and remember Me, because I am able to replace weakness with strength\nand failure with victory; I will support you from sources unimaginable.\nSalah\nforges a connection between Allah and the person who prays and it means that\none is never far from the protection of Allah.  In this day and age when our\nfears about the future tend to overwhelm us, an unbreakable bond is a thing of\ncomfort and joy.\nLesson 2\nAllah hears our prayer and supplication.\nMusawas a man of honour.  Even after walking\nacross the Egyptian desert exhausted and dehydrated he was able to put the\nneeds of others before his own.  Instead of sinking down in the shade of a tree\nat a desert oasis he helped two young women who were trying to water their\nflock of sheep.  However, when his task was finished he sat down heavily and\nappealed to Allah for help.  He said, “O Lord, whatever good you can bestow on\nme, I am surely in need of it”.  Before his supplication was finished, the help\nfrom Allah was on its way.   Musa was probably hoping for a slice of bread or a\nhandful of dates but instead Allah gave him safety, provisions and a family.  A\nperson must never despair of Allah hearing his prayer and supplication.   We\nare never alone, just as Musawas not alone when he fled from his land leaving\nbehind everything.\nLesson 3\nIf a person accepts that there is no true god but Allah no\nsin is unforgiveable.\nOne part of the story of Musa that has intrigued people\nfor centuries is the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of the Egyptians. \nWhen Pharaoh had power, wealth, good health and strength he refused to\nacknowledge Allah.  He denied the signs and ridiculed, belittled and threatened\nP"

Verily, I have turned my face towards\nHim Who has created the heavens and the earth, away from idolatry, and I am not\nof those who associate others with God.” (Quran 6:78)\nThus Ibrahim proved to his satisfaction and the\nconsternation of his peers that the Lord of the worlds was not to be found in\nthe creations that their idols represented, but was, rather, the entity who\ncreated them and everything which they could see and perceive; that the Lord\ndoes not necessarily need to be seen in order to be worshipped.  He is an\nAll-Able Lord, not bound by limitations as the creations found in this world are.\n“And We verily gave Ibrahim of old his proper course.”\n[2]\nHowever, despite these proofs his people still argued\nwith him.\n[3]\nThey\nsaid:\n“Nay, but we found our wise fathers acting in this way.”\n[4]\nHe denied that one’s ancestors are necessarily right, or\nthat we should slavishly follow their customs, by saying:\n“Verily you and your fathers were in plain error.”\nHis message was simple:\n“Worship God, and keep your duty to Him; that is better for\nyou if you did but know.  You worship instead of God only idols, and you only\ninvent a lie.  Lo!  Those whom you worship instead of God own no provision for\nyou.  So seek your provision from God, and worship Him, and give thanks to Him,\n(for) to Him you will be brought back.”\n[5]\nThen the time came when preaching had to be accompanied\nwith physical action.  Ibrahim planned a bold and decisive blow at idolatry, a\nplan which had hinted involved their idols,\n“And, by God, I shall circumvent your idols after you have\ngone away and turned your backs.” (Quran 21:57)\nIt was time for a r"

And Isa answered him, ‘The first of all the\ncommandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.’“\nIn the Quran, Prophet Isa says,\n“… ‘I\nhave come to you with wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the\n(points) on which you dispute.  Therefore, fear Allah and obey me. Indeed,\nAllah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.  This is a straight path.’”\n(Quran 43:63)\nIn the words from the King James Bible,\nwhen one of Isa’s disciples asked him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught\nhis disciples.” He replied, “When you pray, say: ‘Our Father in heaven,\nhallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is\nin heaven.  Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us the wrong we have\ndone as we forgive those who wrong us.  Subject us not to the trial but deliver\nus from the evil one.’“ (Luke 11:1-4, Matthew 6:9-13)\nIsa was\nteaching his followers what Christianity refers to as “The Lord’s Prayer”, a\nprayer that Christians esteem in much the same way as Muslims think of the\nopening chapter of Quran,\nAl-Fatihah\n.\nLesson 3\nA brotherly bond exists between Prophets Isa\nand Muhammad\nLike Isa son of Mary, the Prophet\nMuhammad came to confirm the message of all the Prophets before him; he called\nthe people to worship the One God.  In his\nSunnah\nProphet Muhammad\nrefers to the relationship that exists between all of the prophets of Allah as\na brotherhood. But when he spoke about Prophet Isa, he said:\n“I am nearest\nto the son of Mary in this world and the Hereafter.  There is no prophet\nbetween him and me.\n“\n[1]\nHe also said,\n“Whoever testifies\nthat there in none worthy of being worshipped but God, Who has no partner, and\nthat Muhammad is His slave and Prophet, and that Jesus is the Slave of God, His\nProphet, and His word\n[2]\nwhich\nHe bestowed in Mary and a spirit created from Him; and that Paradise (Heaven)\nis true, and that the Hellfire is true, God will eventually admit him into\nParadise, according to his deeds.”\n[3]\nGod says in the Quran:\n“Jesus, Son\nof Mary, is only a Messenger of Allah, and a fulfilment of His command, 'Be',\nwhich He conveyed to Mary, and he is a soul from Him, like the souls of the\nrest of humans.”\n[4]\nLesson 4\nSocial justice\nBoth Prophets Muhammad and Isahad\nstrong and uncompromising visions of social justice.  They both fought against\ninequalities and injustices in their respec"

 She, however, simply prayed to Allah for\nhis release, to demonstrate that only He has the power, if He wills, to protect\nher.  Only after a failed third attempt did he finally let her go.  Sarah\nreturned to Ibrahim, accompanied by Hagar, a gift from Pharaoh to propitiate one\nso protected by Allah.  She had delivered a powerful message to the pagan\nEgyptians, yet still the Pharaoh misdirected his propitiation, which should\nhave been directed towards Allah.\nLoaded with gifts, Ibrahim returned to Palestine.  Yet Sarah\nand Ibrahim continued to be childless, despite divine promises that he will\nhave many descendants.  Driven by altruism, Sarah suggested that Ibrahim take\nHagar, her handmaiden, as a second wife to bear him a child on her behalf.  While\nin Palestine, Ibrahim married Hagar who bore him a son, Ishmael.\nWhile Ishmael was still nursing, Ibrahim was commanded\nby Allah to take Hagar and Ishmael to a barren valley of Bakka 700 miles\nsoutheast of Hebron.  In later times it would be called Mecca.  Ibrahim left\nthem there with a skin of water and leather bag full of dates.  As Ibrahim\nbegan walking away leaving them behind, Hagar became anxious about what was\nhappening.  Ibrahim did not look back.  Hagar chased him,\n‘O Ibrahim, where\nare you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company\nwe can enjoy, nor is there anything here?’\nIbrahim hurried his pace.  Finally,\nHagar asked,\n‘Has Allah asked you to do so?’  Suddenly, Ibrahim stopped,\nturned back and said, ‘Yes!’\nFeeling a degree of comfort in this answer,\nHagar asked,\n‘O Ibrahim, to whom are you leaving us?’  ‘I am leaving you to\nAllah’s care,’\nIbrahim replied.  Hagar submitted to her Lord,\n‘I am\nsatisfied to be with Allah!’\n[2]\nShe\ntraced her way back to little Ishmael.  Ibrahim left with prayers for his wife\nand child, which he prayed when he was out of sight.\nSoon, the water and dates were gone and Hagar’s\ndesperation increased.  Unable to quench her thirst or to breastfeed her little\nbaby, Hagar began searching for water.  She began climbing the rocky incline of\na nearby hill.  ‘Maybe there is a caravan passing by,’ she thought to herself. \nShe ran between the two hills of Safa and Marwa seven times looking for signs\nof water, and then she heard a voice.  Looking down in the valley, she saw someone\nstanding next to Ishmael.  It was the angel Gabriel,  who hit the ground next\nto the baby with his heel as she came rushing down the hill, and water came\ngushing out.  It was a miracle!

    "fullText": "Lesson Objectives:\n·To understand that Islam commands unity and\nshuns division.\n·To understand that all sects are not equal:\nthere are sects with “small” mistakes, but are still Muslims and then there are\ncults which call themselves Muslims, but are universally acknowledged to be\nnon-Muslims.\n·To learn the Islamic guidance on how to\navoid confusion.\n·To understand the importance of the “\nSahabah\n”.\nArabic Terms\n·\nSahabah\n- the plural form of\nSahabi, which translates to Companions.  A\nsahabi\n, as the\nword is commonly used today, is someone who saw Prophet Muhammad, believed in\nhim and died as a Muslim.\n·\nSunnah\n- The word Sunnah has several\nmeanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally\naccepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.\nWhile the majority of Muslims share the same fundamental\nbeliefs, with 1.62 billion adherents –close to a quarter of planet Earth’s\npopulation\n[1]\n– distributed over the far stretches of the continents and among 49 countries\nwhere Muslims are a majority and a history of more than a thousand years, all people\nwho call themselves Muslims are not exactly the same.  There are sometimes\nsignificant religious differences between them.  In the following two lessons, we\nwill cover the following points in more detail:\nDo the existence of sects mean that Islamic teachings\n(contained in Quran and\nSunnah\n) mandate them? The answer is no.  What is\nimportant is to realize that unlike other religions, Allah has taken upon\nHimself to protect Islam - the last revelation and the most complete religion\nof God to humanity.  You will not find any promise from God in the Bible or\nalmost any other religious text that He will protect it.  On the other hand,\nyou do find two important promises from God in the Quran:\n“God has completed His religion of Islam” (Quran 5:3)\nGod will protect and safeguard His religion form change (Quran\n15:9)\nThe existence of sects is due to reasons whose\ndiscussion is beyond this lesson.\nAll Sects are Not Equal: An Analogy of Circles\nAn analogy can better explain the issue of sects.  The\nQuran and\nSunnah\nsit at the center around which there are many circles. \nSome Muslims will lie within a circle, but others will lie outside of it.  In\nother words, some Muslims will be closer to the center, others may be distant. \nThen, think of a red circle which is so far from the center that anyone who\nlies outside of that red circle is not even considered a Muslim.  The radius of\nthe circle is a measure of how “deviant” the sect is.\nIn other words, the most “deviant” sects, one can call\nthem cults, will be outside of the red circle.  They will be the ones that have\nthe most serious conflict with the established Islamic beliefs and practices.  Examples\nwould be Ahmadis, Bahais, and the Druze.\nSects Are Confusing, Who Do I Follow?\nWhat becomes confusing is that with the existence of\ndifferent sects, who does a new Muslim follow, especially when most sects claim\nto follow the Quran and\nSunnah\n.  What is a new Muslim to do? How does he\nor she determine who is right and who is wrong? In simple words, how does a new\nMuslim avoid confusion? Let us break down the answer to this question in a few\npoints:\nFirst\n, if we go back to the Quran and\nSunnah\n,\nwe will find the answer to this question.  You see, the Quran and\nSunnah\nare texts; some will try to take the Quran alone, separating it from the\nSunnah\n(Prophetic traditions). They would then interpret the Quran they way they like.\nThe only way to properly understand the Quran is by going back to the Prophetic\ntraditions and to understand both in light of the understanding of the people\nwho were present at the time of revelation.  These texts were revealed in their\ntime, many of the texts were addressed to them\n[2]\n,\nand they had the best teacher (the Prophet of Allah) to explain to them anything\nthat needed explanation.  Let us see what the Prophet said regarding this\nmatter,\n“The best of people is my generation, then those who\ncome after them, then those who come after them.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh\nMuslim)\nThe Prophet distinguished the first three generation of\nMuslims to be the “best.” If they are the “best” according to the Prophet of\nIslam, then it makes sense that we understand and practice Islam the way the\n“best” people understood and practiced Islam.\nSecond\n, it is important to know that the first\ngeneration of Islam is known as the generation of the “\nSahabah\n.” The\nword “\nsahabah\n” means “companions” in Arabic.  Its singular is “\nsahabi\n,”\nwhich means a “companion.” The second and third generation also have names, but\n“\nsahabah\n” is the most important term to know for now.\nThird\n, it is important that one not judge for\nhimself who is Muslim and who is not. When one lacks the proper knowledge,\nissues such as this should be left to the scholars. There are some sects that\ndo have good and bad incorporated into their beliefs. Take Sufis\n[3]\nas an example. \nAll their beliefs and pr"

Even\nwithin a sect, there are sub sects that vary greatly in their teachings.\nKeeping this in mind, below is a brief discussion of some sects:\n1.Ahmadis\n[1]\nAhmadis or Qadiyanis are a missionary-oriented sect of Indian\norigin, founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1839-1908). The Qadiyanis currently have\na presence in many countries, including most Western countries. Their world\nwide numbers are estimated as high as 10 million. Even though their\nheadquarters are in Pakistan, they have a strong presence in London, UK.\n2.Ismailis\nAlso known as “Sevener Shi'ites.” The Ismailis reject\nthe Quran and all forms of prayers found in the main Sunni Islamic tradition.\nThis frees them from obligations such as prayer, fasting, and hajj. They are\nmostly located in Pakistan, North-west India and the Chinese province of\nSin-Kiang. The Khojas, a sub-sect, are mainly to be found in Gujarat, India.\nThere are also Khoja communities in East and South Africa. They are also found\nin the Western countries. Most Ismaili businesses put the picture of Prince\nKarim Agha Khan, their leader, at a prominent place in their shop.\n3.Bahais\n[2]\nBahais follow the teaching of Bahaullah ('splendor of\nGod') (1817-1892). They attract followers by speaking of unity of humanity and\nthe absolute equality of men and women. Bahais see themselves working towards\nthe establishment of a world government which will eradicate extremes of wealth\nand poverty. The writings of Bahaullah are treated as sacred. It is estimated\nthat there are between 3 to 4 million Bahais in the world today, spread in most\ncountries of the world with the largest concentration in India. In Iran the\nBahais remain the largest minority group with about 300,000 adherents. The\ninternational Baha'i center is in Israel.\n4.Shias\n[3]\nAlso spelled “Shi’ites.” The “Twelver Shias” believe\nthat, after the death of the Prophet, the Imamate (the political and religious\nleadership of the Muslim community) should have gone to 'Ali - the cousin and\nson-in-law of the Prophet - and his descendants as a divine right.\nUnlike\nthe Sunnis, who perform prayers five times a day, the Shi'ites pray three times\na day. The Twelver Shias population in 1980 was estimated to be 73,000,000.\nThey are dominant in Iran, but are also found in Pakistan, India, Iraq,\nLebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Syria. There are also small Shia communities\nin the West, one of the largest in Dearborn, Michigan.\n5.Nation of Islam\n[4]\nThe Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace Muhammad in\nDetroit in 1930. The group believes that a person called Fard Muhammad was “God\non earth.” It sees Elijah Muhammad as the Messenger of Truth.\nWarith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad, brought the group closer to\nmainstream Sunni Islam. Some dissatisfied members were led by Louis Farrakhan,\nwho revived the group in 1978 with the same teachings of Elijah. They only\nallow people of black ethnicity in and believe they are the original race on\nearth. They are especially popular in the prison system in the US.\n6.Submitters\nFounded by Dr. Rashad Khalifa, an Egyptian computer\nscientist. Submitters consider Rashad Khalifa to be a Messenger of God. They\nreject two verses of the Quran, preach the “miracle of 19,” and reject the\nhadith"

Before discussing\nbidah\nin any depth we must\ndistinguish between two types of\nbidah\n. The first type is innovation in\nthe matter of things pertaining to our worldly life. Things like technology,\nelectricity and transport would come under this category. These things are\npermissible and in many cases could even be called desirable. The second type\nof innovation pertains to matters of the\ndeen\n. In matters of religion\nbidah\nis not permissible and it can be dangerous to introduce new things in our\nreligion. Because of the danger there are many quotations and traditions from\nthe\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad that point this out.\n“Whoever innovates into this affair of ours\nsomething that we have not commanded, it is to be rejected”.\n[1]\nThe best speech is the Book of Allah and the best\nguidance and example is that of Muhammad, and the worst of all things are the\nnewly invented things (in the religion), for every religious innovation is an\nerror and a misguidance.”\n[2]\n“…Every religious innovation is a means of\nmisguidance and every means of misguidance is in the fire.”\n[3]\nThe\ndeen\nof Islam has no need for\nbidah\n. The\nreligion of Islam is complete and there is no need to introduce or invent new\nmatters in the religion. This is confirmed by the Quranic statement\n“This\nday I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and\nhave chosen for you Islam as your\ndeen\n” (Quran 5:3)\nWhen a person innovates something and adds to the\ndeen\nsomething that does not already belong to it, he implies that the religion is\nlacking and in need of improvement, or the implication is that Allah did not\ncomplete and perfect it His religion. This is clearly not the case as we can\nsee from the above verse.\nWhy is it important to avoid\nbidah\nWhilst Allah does not punish a person who falls into\nerror due to ignorance we are obligated to educate ourselves to the best of our\nability. The reality is that Allah will not accept an action that does not\nfulfil two important conditions. The first condition is that the action be done\nwith a sincere intention to please Allah almighty. The second is that the\naction is done according to what is taught in the Quran and the authentic S\nunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad. The action must conform to the\nSunnah\nand not be in\ncontradiction to it.\nWith this in mind let us revisit the meaning of\nbidah\n.\n Linguistically, it means creating or inventing something new, something\nwithout precedence.  Legally, it is to add something new to the\ndeen\nof\nAllah. Even if the action is invented as a way of drawing closer to or\nworshipping Allah it still does not become acceptable. It is still a sin.\nHow do we know if an act of worship is really an act of\nbidah\n?\nOn many occasions you will hear it said that Islam is a\nreligion of informed knowledge. This implies that believers do not take things\non face value. A believer takes the time to learn and understand the details of\nthe\ndeen\nand he learns to question actions or sayings that are not\npresented with clear evidence. If he takes the time to learn Islam a person is\nable to recognise what is a\nSunnah\naction and what is\nbidah\n.\nThe following are six ways to distinguish between a\nSunnah\nand a\nbidah:\n1.An act of worship related to a cause or reason that has not been\nlegislated:\nIt is not\npermissible to link an act of worship to a cause or reason that has not been\nlegislated in the Quran or the authentic\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad.  An\nexample of this would be waking up to pray at night during the seventh day of\nthe Islamic month of\nRajab\nwith the belief that Prophet Muhammad\nascended to the heavens on this night. The act of praying in the night is\nsomething that is legislated in Islam with sufficient evidence from the Quran\nand\nSunnah\n, however when it is linked to this reason it becomes a\nbidah\nbecause it is based and constructed upon a reason which is not established from\nthe\nShariah\n.\n2.Type of worship:\nIt is also essential that the act of worship agrees with\nthe\nShariah\nin its type. If a person was to worship Allah with an act of\nworship whose t"

If a person decided to\npray five\nrakahs\nof prayer for the\nDhuhr\nprayer this would be a\nbidah\n.\nWe know that this prayer consists of four\nrakahs\n; this is what is\nlegislated and to introduce an extra unit of prayer would be considered an\ninnovation, a\nbidah\n.\n4.Manner of performance of worship:\nAnother way of distinguishing between something that\noriginates in the Quran and the\nSunnah\nand an innovation is to look at\nthe manner of performance. That is, how do we perform the act of worship, is it\nin accordance with what the\ndeen\nof Islam teaches, or have we overstepped\nthe boundaries and added something to a religion that has already been\nperfected. An example of this is making ablution before prayer in an incorrect\norder, such as beginning with washing the feet instead of finishing with this.\n5.Time of worship:\nThe time we perform an act of worship is also important.\nIf a worship is performed according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and\nthe specified time, then it does indeed please our Creator. However if a person\ntakes it upon himself to change the specified time then that person has fallen\ninto the sin of\nbidah\n. For example, sacrificing sheep in the month of\nRamadan\nwith the intention of seeking a reward similar to the reward for sacrificing on\nEid ul-Adha\nthen this would be considered an innovation.\n6.Place of worship:\nThe place in which the act of worship is performed\nshould also be in accordance with what has been legislated. If, for example a\nperson was to make\nitikaf\nin his home this would not be acceptable. The\nplace for\nitikaf\nis the mosque, thus performing it in any other place\nwould be considered a\nbidah\n.\nA list of common innovations\n·Seeking help from the occupants of the grave.\nThis\nbidah\nis of particular importance because it also encompasses\nshirk\n,\nthe greatest sin in Islam.\n·Sitting in groups and saying words of\nremembrance of Allah, such as Allahu Akbar, in unison.\n·Taking the birthday of the Prophet as an\nEid\n.\n·Fasting on the fifteenth of the Islamic\nmonth of\nShaban\nand spending that night in prayer.\n·Celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad,\nmay the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.\n·Reciting Quran to benefit the deceased (this\nincludes hiring people to recite Quran).\n·Wiping over the back of the neck when making\nablution.\n·The family of the deceased preparing food\nfor others who visit.\nWhat is a “good\nbidah\n”?\nOn occasions you might hear  of something called a ‘good\nbidah\n’. According to Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him,\n“… there is no such thing in Islam (in the religious sense) as a good\nbidah\n.”\n[1]\nThe sheikh also emphasised that “…with regard\nto ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called\nbidah\n(innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic\nterms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not\nthe things that the Prophet was warning us against”. In addition to this noted\nIslamic scholar Imam Ibn Rajab\n[2]\nsaid, “Any words from our righteous predecessors considering something as a good\nbidah\nwere meant in a linguistic sense and not the Islamic sense”.\nIn conclusion\nbidah\nis a newly invented belief or\naction in the\ndeen\nof Islam by which closeness to Allah is sought but it\nis not supported by any authentic proof"

In Islam it is a narrative record of the sayings and\nactions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nFajr\n- the morning prayer.\nIntroduction\nLinguistically, theterm\nAdhan\nmeans “a\nproclamation”, and this is what is meant in the verse of the Quran:\n“And a\nproclamation\n(adhan) from Allah and His\nmessenger to all people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free\nfrom (all) obligations to the polytheists, and so is His messenger.” (Quran\n9:3)\nIn religious context, the\nadhan\nis that proclamation\nmade, consisting of specific “words of remembrance”, the time for an obligatory\nsalah\nhas begun. Throughout the Muslim world and in some places in the\nWest, the caller to prayer announces five times a day from every mosque that it\nis time for prayer, to remember Allah, and to put aside all the cares of life\nto prepare for the worship of the Giver of Life.  The prayer “God is the\nGreatest” resonates through all semblances of civilization, through small towns\nto metropolises.\nThe\nadhan\ncovers all the essentials of the Islamic\nfaith in a few words:\n1.    It begins by proclaiming the greatness of\nAllah.\n2.    It testifies to Allah’s\ntawheed\nand\nHis exclusive right to worship.\n3.    It denies\nshirk\n– the worship of\neverything besides Allah.\n4.    The\nadhan\ntestifies that Muhammad, may\nthe mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, is the Messenger of Allah.\n5.    It mentions belief in one of the greatest\npillars of Islam: the\nsalah\n(ritual prayer).\n6.    Invites to the prayer and equates it with\nprosperity, salvation and success (in the hereafter)\n7.    It affirms the reward for\nsalah\n:\nprosperity for one who singles out Allah in\ntawheed\n, follows His\nMessenger, establishes the\nsalah\nand other pillars of Islam.\n8.    It implies the loss of one who does not\nrespond to the\nadhan\nand does not pray.\nHistory of\nAdhan\nThe\nadhan\nwas prescribed during the first year after\nthe Prophet migration to Medina.  It was taught in true visions to two\ncompanions and made part of Muslim life by the Prophet himself.  Abdullah ibn\nZaid, a companion of the Prophet, reported:\n“When the Prophet was\nto order the use of a bell to call the people to prayer, he disliked it because\nit resembled the Christian practice.  While I was sleeping, a man came to me carrying\na bell.  I said to him, ‘O slave of Allah, will you sell me that bell?’\nHe said, ‘What would\nyou do with it?’\nI replied, ‘I would\ncall the people to prayer with it.’\nHe responded, ‘Shall I\nnot guide you to something better than that?’\nI said, ‘Certainly.’\nHe said, ‘You should\nsay:\nAllahu akbar, Allahu\nakbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar\nAshhadu alla ilaha illal-lah,\nashhadu alla ilaha illal-lah\nAshhadu anna\nMuhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah,\nashhadu anna\nMuhammadar-Rasool-lal-lah\nHayya ‘alas-salah,\nhayyah ‘alas-salah\nHayya ‘alal-falah,\nhayya ‘alal-falah\nAllahu akbar, Allahu\nakbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’\nThen he went a short\ndistance away and said, ‘When you stand for the prayer, say:\nAllahu\nakbar,\nAllahu akbar\nAshhadu alla ilaha\nillal-lah\nAshhadu anna\nMuhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah\nHayya ‘alas-salah,\nhayya ‘alal-falah\nQad qaamatis-salah,\nqad qaamatis-salah\nAllahu akbar, Allahu\nakbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’\nWhen the morning came, I went to the Messenger of\nAllah to tell him what I had seen.  He said, ‘Your dream is true, Allah willing. \nGo to Bilal, tell him what you have seen, and tell him to make the call to\nprayer, for he has the best voice among you.’ I went to Bilal and told him what\nto do, and he made the call to prayer.  ‘Umar was in his house when he heard it. \nHe came out with his cloak, saying ‘By the One who has raised you with the\ntruth, I saw similar to what he saw.’ The Prophet said, ‘All praise is to\nAllah.’”\n[1]\nThe Prophet appointed two companions to call the\nadhan\nin Medina in his mosque: Bilal, a former African slave whose freedom was bought\nby Abu Bakr, and Ibn Umm Maktum for the\nadhan\nof\nFajr\n.  He also\nappointed Abu Mah-zura in Mecca and Sa’ad al-Qaraz in Q"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To appreciate the role of the mosque in\nMuslim life in the West.\n·To learn 6 etiquettes of attending the\nmosque.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nMasjid\n- the Arabic term for mosque.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling\nMuslims to the five obligatory Prayers.\n·\nAs-Salamu Alaikum -\npeace and\nblessings be on you.\n·\nSalam\n- The Islamic greeting such as\n'\nAs-Salamu Alaikum\n'.\nThe\nmasjid\n, translated as\nmosque in English, is the heartbeat of the Muslim society in Islam. In the\nWest, most often Muslims buy land and build a\nmasjid\non it. Other times,\nthey buy a church or some other building and convert it into a\nmasjid\n.\nSometimes, they even rent a room, garage, or a basement and use it as makeshift\nmasjid\n.\nIn all cases, a\nmasjid\nis a place for Muslims where\nthey meet one another daily to perform the prayers and also to conduct other\nacts of worship and activities that are beneficial for the Muslim community.\nThe most important act of worship done in the\nmasjid\nis the Friday prayer. Five daily prayers are also offered in most of them. Many\nmasjids\nwill have a dedicated\nimam\n, a prayer leader, who will\nlead the daily prayers. Some of them do not have a dedicated\nimam\n, but one\nof the attendees will lead the prayer when the prayer time comes. Similarly,\nthe regular\nimam\nmight also deliver the Friday sermon and lead the\nprayers or there might be different speakers who rotate weekly and deliver the\nFriday sermon.\nProphet Muhammad taught us that the\nmasjids\nare houses\nof Allah and that certain etiquettes and rules should be learned and observed\nby every Muslim who attends them.\nFollowing are some of the etiquettes and manners of a\nmasjid\n:\n1.    Worship is the first priority. The primary purpose\nof going to the\nmasjid\nis to worship the One true Lord of the heavens\nand the earth. Everything else is secondary. Many mosques provide gaming and\nsocial events like basketball, community dinners, picnics, etc. They are all\nworthwhile, but serve a secondary purpose. The\nmasjid\nis primarily a\nplace for the worship of Allah and that typically means prayer and reading or\nreciting the Quran.\n2.    The general rule is that a Muslim should be\nclean, wear clean clothes, and not smell bad when he or she comes to the mosque.\nHe should avoid everything that has an offensive smell like that caused by eating\nraw garlic, raw onions, or smoking.\nA Muslim should also wear clean clothes and socks when\nhe comes to the\nmasjid\n. Not only do bad smells bother fellow human\nbeings, but they also offend the angels who are present. Remember, that a\nmasjid\nis the house of Allah after all.\nIf a person performs work that makes him sweat or other\nbodily odors, then he should take a shower and change clothes before coming to\nthe\nmasjid\n. It is reported that the Prophet Muhammad said:\nWhoever eats garlic or onion, then he must\nkeep away from our\nmasjid\nbecause the angels get offended from what\noffends the children of Adam. (Saheeh Muslim)\n3.    A Muslim should enter the\nmasjid\nwith\nhis right foot first, and then say what was reported from Prophet Muhammad:\n“\nAllah-hum-maf-tah lee abwaaba\nrahmatik\n.”\n“O Allah, open the gates of your Mercy\nfor me.”\nThis supplications is optional, however saying it is a\nrewarding act.\nThe Prophet liked to start with his right side in everything.\nThe famous companion of Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Umar, in imitation of the Prophet\nused to step with his right foot first when he entered the\nmasjid\n, and\nstep out with his left foot first when he walked out of the\nmasjid.\n(\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n).\n4.    In order to keep the carpet clean, where people\nput their faces, it is appropriate to remove one's shoes before entering the\nprayer hall. This goes for children as well, who may drag dirt all over the\ncarpet - not to mention that they shouldn't be running around inside the prayer\nhall.\nMany mosques have a rack for shoes that should be\nutilized to keep the space clear of shoes in walkways and other spaces. It also\nmakes it easier to find shoes later on.\n5.    A Muslim should greet people by saying “\nAs-Salamu\nAlaikum\n” to the people in the\nmasjid\nas he enters it, even if he\nsees the people are praying. He does not have to shout it out. Saying it in an\naudible voice is enough. The Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say “\nAs-Salamu\nAlaikum\n” to the Prophet while he was praying, and he used to reply with a gesture.\nThere are many reports about that. For example, Suhaib, a Companion of the\nProphet, said: I passed by the Messenger of Allah while he was praying\nand gave\nSalam\nto him, (and) he replied to me with a gesture. (Nasai)\nIn another instance, Ibn Umar asked Bilal, another\nCompanion of Prophet Muhammad, ‘How did you see the Prophet reply to the Companions\nwhen they said\nSalam\nto him while he was engaged in prayer? Bilal\nsaid: By spreading his palm. (\nTirmidhi\n)\n6 . A Muslim should try to be punctual in arriving for\nthe Friday prayer, the regular prayers, or attending lectures and classes. Late\narr"

benefits of\nnafl\nworship.\n·To learn about the commonly prayed voluntary\nprayers.\nArabic Terms\n·\nFajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha\n– the\nnames of five daily prayers in Islam.\n·\nFard\n– an

prayer.\n·\nTasleem\n– the salutation of peace\nthat ends the prayer.\n·\nDuha\n– name of an optional prayer\ndone during the daytime.\nThe first thing to understand is the difference\nbetween what is known as\nfard\nand what is known as\nnafl\n.\nFard\nis obligatory, it is what Allah requires us to do, and leaving it is a sin and\nwe will be held accountable for it.  An example is two\nrakah\nof\nFajr\nprayer.\nNafl\nliterally means ‘extra’.\nNafl\nworship is not\nrequired from a Muslim, rather it is up to the individual to offer it.  It is\noptional and voluntary.  The Muslim is not sinful for neglecting\nnafl\n,\nbut is rewarded for doing it.  Therefore,\nnafl\nworship is recommended.  Examples\nof\nnafl\nprayers will be covered in this lesson.\nA word of advice about the voluntary prayers.   Add them\nslowly to your daily, obligatory prayers.  You must first focus on the five\ndaily, required prayers and make sure you are praying them regularly and on\ntime.  Add them step by step, do not burn yourself out, and at the same time do\nnot neglect the voluntary prayers.\nBenefit of\nNafl\nPrayers\nThe Prophet said: “The first thing that the people will\nbe called to account for on the Day of Resurrection will be the prayers.  Our\nLord will say to the angels although He knows better: ‘Look into the prayer (formal\nobligatory prayer) of my servant to see if he observed it perfectly or has been\nnegligent in it.’ So if he observed it perfectly it will be recorded to his\ncredit, but if he had been negligent in it in any way, Allah would say: ‘See if\nMy servant has any extra prayers.’ Then if he has any extra prayers, Allah\nwould say: ‘Make up the deficiency in My servant’s obligatory prayer with his\nsupererogatory prayers.’ Thereafter all his actions will be examined in like\nmanner” (Abu Dawud).\nTwo Types Of\nNafl\nPrayers\na)    General\nnafl\nprayers:  One can pray\nthem whenever one likes and there does not have to be any reason or cause for\nit, neither are they restricted to any given number.   However it should be\nnoted that the general\nnafl\nprayers should not be offered at the time\nwhen performing non obligatory prayers is prohibited or disliked.\nb)   Specific\nnafl\nprayers:  These prayers are\nassociated with a specific reason or cause.\nExamples of Commonly Prayed Specific\nNafl\nPrayers\nAs-Sunan ar-Rawatib\n(often simply referred to as  ‘\nSunnah\nprayers’)\nThey are voluntary prayers that are associated with the\nobligatory prayers and have a specific order and number.  The ones often prayed\nare listed below:\nName of Prayer\nRakah\nof\nFard\nPrayer\nRakah\nof ‘\nSunnah\nPrayer\n’\nBefore\nFard\nRakah\nof ‘\nSunnah\nPrayer’\n  After\nFard\nFajr\n2\n2\nDhuhr\n4\n4 (2+2)\n2\nAsr\n4\nMagrib\n3\n2\nIsha\n4\n2\nThe\nMessenger of\nAllah said:\n“Whoever prays twelve\nrakah\nduring the day and night\nwill have a house built for him in Paradise: four\nrakah\nbefore\nDhuhr\nand two after it, two\nrakah\nafter\nMaghrib\n, two\nrakah\nafter\nIsha\n, and two\nrakah\nbefore\nFajr\n.” (\nTirmidhi\n)\nThe Prophet said\nabout the two\nrakah\nbefore the obligatory\nFajr\nprayer\n, “They\nare dearer to me than the whole world.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\n“The Prophet never left praying four\nrakah\nbefore\nDhuhr\nand two\nrakah\nbefore\nFajr\nunder any\ncircumstances.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nWitr\nPrayer\nThe Prophet prayed and encouraged others to pray the\nWitr\nprayer.  It is a\nnafl\nand highly emphasized optional prayer, and according\nto some scholars it is a required prayer.\nIt is offered after\nIsha\nprayer and can be prayed\nbefore the time for\nFajr\nprayer starts.\nIt is permissible to perform the\nWitr\nby:\n1.Praying two\nrakah\nlike any other two\nrakah\nprayer,\nconcluding them with\ntasleem\nand then praying one more\nrakah\nand ending\nthe prayer with\ntasleem\n.\n2.Praying three\nrakah\ncontinually (\nwithout\nsitting\nafter the second\nrakah\nas in\nMagrib\n) and then concluding the\nprayer with\ntasleem.\n3.One\nrakah\nand ending the prayer with\ntasleem\n.\nTahiyya-tul-Masjid\n(Prayer for Entering the Mosque)\nIt is a prayer in which two\nnafl\nrakah\nare\nperformed at the time of entering the mosque.  The Messenger said,\n“If\nanyone of you enters a mosque, he should pray two\nrakah\nbefore sitting.”\n(\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nSalat at-Tawba\n(Prayer of Repentance)\nAllah’s Messenger\nsaid,\n“There is no man who, upon committing a sin, purifies himself and\nperforms two\nrakah\n, then asks for forgiveness from Allah, but Allah\nforgives him” (\nAbu Daud, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah\n)\nDuha\nPrayer\nAbu Dhar reports\nthat the Prophet said:\n“Charity is required from every part of your body\ndaily.  E"

A\nwajib\n(obligatory act) is waived if one\nforgets, and it can be compensated for by doing the “prostration of\nforgetfulness” (will be discussed later).\nIn this lesson we will first learn the\narkan\n(essential\ncomponents).\nEssential Components (\nArkan\n)\nof\nSalah\n1. Saying ‘\nAllahu Akbar\n’ at the beginning\nThe Prophet said to a person who prayed incorrectly, “then\nface the\nqiblah\nand say\nAllahu Akbar.\n”\n[1]\n2. Reciting\nSurah\nal-Fatihah\nThe Prophet said,  “There is no prayer for someone who\ndoes not recite the Opening of the Book (\nSurah\nal-Fatihah).”\n[2]\n3. Standing during obligatory prayers if one is able to do so\nBased on the verse,\n“and stand for Allah with\ndevotion.” (Quran 2:238)\nAlso, the Prophet said, “Pray standing; if you are not\nable to; pray sitting, if you are not able to; pray (while lying) on your side.”\n[3]\n4. Bowing\nThis is based on the Prophet’s saying to the person who\nprayed incorrectly,  “then be at ease until you are at ease in bowing.”\n[4]\nAnd remaining in that position until you attain\ncalmness.\nSpeaking about the importance of this matter, he said, “The\nworst people are the thieves who steal part of the prayer.”  He was asked how\nthis was done, and he replied, “He does not complete his bowings and\nprostrations,” or he said, “He does not straighten his back during his bowings\nand prostrations.”\n[5]\n“The prayer of one who does not straighten his back in\nhis bowings and prostrations is not accomplished.”\n[6]\n5. Rising up from bowing\nThis is based on the\nhadith\n, “then rise till you\nare standing straight.” (Bukhari, Muslim)\n6. Prostration\nThis is based on the\nhadith\n, “then prostrate till\nyou are at ease in prostration.”\n7. Sitting between the two prostrations\nThis is based on the\nhadith\n, “then rise up till\nyou are at ease sitting.”\n8. Attaining calmness\nA person prayed too fast without attaining calmness. The\nProphet disapproved his speed and said, “you did not pray.”\nAttaining calmness means that each body part assumes the\nappropriate position before one moves from one position to another.\n9. Reciting the final\ntashahhud\nThis will be done in the final sitting of the prayer. The\nwords of the\ntashahhud\nwere taught by Prophet himself.  Ibn Mas’ud said,\na companion of the Prophet, said, “Before it was made obligatory to say the\ntashahhud\n,\nwe used to say, ‘Peace be upon Allah, and peace be upon Gabriel and Michael.’\nThen the Messenger of Allah said, ‘Do not say that but say, ‘All compliments\nare for Allah…’”\n[7]\n.\n10.   Sitting to recite the final\ntashahhud\nThis will be the final sitting of the prayer.\n11. Sending blessings on the Prophet after the final\ntashahhud\nThis is to be done after reciting the final\ntashahhud\n.\n12. Saying ‘\nAs-Salamu\n’\nAlaikum\nwa-Rahmatullah\n’ to conclude the prayer\nIn an obligatory prayer it has to be said twice, however\nin the funeral prayer it is sufficient to say it once.\n13. Order\nAll the “essential components” of salah need to be\nperformed in the correct order.\nActs That Invalidate the Prayer\nThere are certain acts that if done, would invalidate\nthe prayer. What that means is that a person has to start over the prayer from\nthe beginning.\n1. Being certain that you broke the\nwudoo\nA man complained to the Messenger of Allah about feeling\nsomething  (in his abdomen) in the prayer. The Prophet said, “Do not turn away\n(from\nsalah\n) unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.”\n[8]\nThis does not mean you only turn away from\nsalah\nwhen you hear a sound or notice a smell. As long as you are\nsure\nyou\nbroke wind and passed gas, your\nwudoo\nis broken and  you must make it\nagain and start the prayer from the beginning.\n2. Intentionally not performing a\nrukn\nor prerequisite\nof prayer without a valid excuse\nThis is based on the Prophet saying to the man who did\nnot pray properly, “Go back and pray for you h"

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To learn 12 additional etiquettes of\nattending the mosque.\nArabic Terms:\n·\nMasjid\n- the Arabic term for mosque.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\n·\nHadith\n-  (plural –\nahadith\n) is\na piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling\nMuslims to the five obligatory Prayers.\n·\nNafl\n- a voluntary act of worship.\n·\nRuku’\n- the bowing position in\nprayer.\n·\nRakah\n-  unit of prayer.\n·\nFajr\n- the morning prayer.\n·\nDhuhr\n- the afternoon prayer.\n·\nSutrah\n-  a barrier a person puts in\nfront of him while praying.\n7.    A person must not rush to catch up prayer\nthat is in progress at entering the\nmasjid\n, because the Prophet forbade\nrushing in such a situation. Prophet Muhammad said:\n“If the prayer started, then do not join it\nrunning, but join it walking and do it calmly, and pray whatever you caught up\nwith, and make up for what you missed.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nIf a Muslim arrives late to a prayer, he should say “\nAllahu\nAkbar\n” and join the congregation. If a\nrakah\nwas joined after\nruku’\n,\nthen the entire\nrakah\nneeds to be repeated after the prayer. So when the\nimam finishes with the prayer then you should stand up and make-up what you\nmissed.\nIt is appropriate to join the back row and fill in all\nthe spaces. If there is no more room, then a new row should start directly\nbehind the imam, and more latecomers fill out to the right and to the left.\nSisters should begin a new row in front if the row starts in the back.\n8.    One should keep quiet during the prayer. During\nthe congregational prayer, there is no good reason for making a lot of noise\nwhile people are trying to pray, yet conversations can sometimes be heard\nduring the prayer! Children should be trained to stay near their parent in prayer\nif possible, or if not, they should not be brought to the\nmasjid\nto pray.\n9.    The Muslim should not distract others praying\nin the\nmasjid\n, because a person in prayer is in contact with Allah.\nCausing distraction is quite a serious matter - people should not be disturbed\nby actions such as reciting the Quran loudly.\n10.  The one who enters the\nmasjid\nshould\nnot sit until he prays two\nrakahs\n. You pray them the same way you pray\nthe two\nrakahs\nof the obligatory\nFajr\nprayer. The reason you pray\nthem is to show respect to the\nmasjid\nbefore sitting down. The Prophet\nsaid:\n“When one of you enters the\nmasjid\n, he\nshould pray two\nrakah\nbefore sitting down.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh\nMuslim\n)\n11.   If\nan individual is praying outside of the congregation (optional prayers, or obligatory\nprayers alone), he should place something in front of him during prayer as a\nbarrier between himself and the passersby in front of him. It can be a chair, a\nwall, or a pillar. He should also come a little close to it as the Prophet used\nto do. Prophet Muhammad said:\n“If you pray, then pray toward a\nsutrah\n(barrier) and get close to it.” (\nAbu Daud\n)\nIt is not necessary to have a barrier in front of a\nperson if praying in congregation, except for the\nimam\n, whose barrier\nacts for the congregation.\n12.  Muslims are not supposed to walk in front of a\nperson praying. If a person is praying with a\nsutrah\n(barrier), let’s\nsay behind a chair, then you cannot walk between the person and the chair, but\nbeyond the chair. Prophet Muhammad said: “If one knew (the sin) of passing in\nfront of one who is praying, he would rather wait for forty than to pass in\nfront of him.” Abu al-Nadr - one of the\nhadith\nnarrators, said: “I do\nnot remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years.” (Bukhari,\nMuslim)\n13.  The Muslim should sit where he finds a place\nin the\nmasjid\n. The Muslim should not jump over people or squeeze himself\nbetween two people who are already sitting so as not to bother or harm them. Many\nahadith\nof the Prophet convey this meaning.\n14.   Instead of chatting and gossiping, it is\nbetter for a Muslim to keep himself busy supplicating and remembering Allah,\nbecause he is considered as if in the prayer as long as he is waiting for the\nprayer.\n15.  The Muslim should keep the\nmasjid\nclean\nand tidy, and fragrant because it is the house of Allah. The Prophet considered\nspitting in the\nmasjid\nto be a sin that could be forgiven only if the Muslim\ncleans the area. The Prophet of Islam said:\n“Spitting in the\nmasjid\nis a sin and its\nexpiation is to clean it.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nThe Companions of the Prophet used to keep the\nmasjid\nclean, like the famous Companion, Ibn Umar, used to put perfume inside the\nmasjid\nwhen Umar, his father, sat on the pulpit to deliver Friday sermon (Abu Daud). Traditional\nincense or modern day sprays and electric devices can be used for the purpose.\n16.  The Muslim should not walk out of the\nmasjid\nafter the\nAdhan\nhas been given before he prays that prayer with other Muslims\nin congregation. Let us say you have prayed\nDhuhr\nearlier at home or\nanother\nmasjid\n, then you go to"

The prayers are obligatory on every Muslim\nman and woman five times a day throughout their life once they declare Islam.  The\nprayer (\nsalah\n) is the second pillar of Islam, after the two Testimonies. \nWhether one is rich or poor, healthy or sick, traveling or resident, a Muslim\nmust pray.\n[2]\nEvery\nMuslim should learn the rules and regulations of praying correctly and pray\nfive times a day.  Learning and performing the prayer should be the first\npriority of every new Muslim.  If you are new to Islam, incorporating a new\nreligious practice done in an unfamiliar language may feel strange and intimidating,\nbut soon with patience and Allah’s help it will become part of your life.  Prayer\nto a Muslim is as important as breathing, and  it isn’t as difficult as it may\nseem!\nThe prayer revolves around three supreme\nrealities in a Muslim’s life: Allah, His Prophet, and the community of\nbelievers.  Allah is constantly praised, glorified, thanked, and remembered in prayer\n(\nsalah\n).  A Muslim turns himself inwardly and outwardly to Allah.  The\nmethod of the prayer is that of the Prophet in which he is mentioned as well.  Lastly,\nthe prayer ties one to the community of the faithful, especially when performed\nin the mosque with a local congregation.\nThe prayer (\nsalah\n) is considered the most\nimportant act of worship prescribed for human beings.  It is the backbone of\nreligious observance of a Muslim. Without a spine, the human body would\ncollapse. Similarly, without the prayer a person’s Islamic practice would fall\napart. The Prophet himself compared it to the spine:\n“The head of all affairs is Islam, its\nspine is the prayer (\nsalah\n)…”\n(Al-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)\nEmphasizing its importance, the Prophet said:\n“Between a person and disbelief is discarding\nthe prayer (\nsalah\n).”\n[3]\nWhat this means is that if a man stops to pray\ncompletely, he slides into disbelief.\nThere are quite a few other points which emphasize\nthe importance of the prayer (\nsalah\n), from them the following:\n- The Prophet at his death bed advised the\nMuslims to pay attention to\nsalah\n.\n[4]\n- It was the first act of worship made\ncompulsory on Muslims who were required to observe the prayer while in Mecca\nbefore migration to Medina.  Compulsory charity (\nZakat\n[5]\n),\nfasting, and pilgrimage were made compulsory in Medina.\n- The first matter we will be questioned about\non the Day of Judgment is\nsalah\n:\n“The first matter which a slave will be\nheld to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer (\nsalah\n).  If it\nis good, all the rest of his deeds become good, but if it is bad, all the rest\nof his deeds become bad.”\n[6]\n- Abraham asked his Lord to give him descendants\nwho would abide by their prayers:\n“My Lord! Cause me and (some) of my offspring to\nremain constant in prayer.  And O our Lord!  Accept my supplication” (Quran 14:40)\nThe Quran is full of commands to pray to\nemphasize its importance.  The prayer has been divinely transmitted to us in\ntwo ways.  First, Allah Himself commanded Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, when he ascended into the heavens in a journey\nknown as the\nMi’raaj\n(The Ascension).  The commandment for the prayer (\nsalah\n)\nwas not brought down by an angel to the Prophet, but the Prophet was taken up\nto the heavens, and Allah addressed him directly in its obligation.  Second,\nthe great angel Gabriel descended to teach the Prophet the five prayers and\ntheir times.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSalah\n:\nThe prescribed actions and words said between the pronouncement of\nAllahu\nAkbar\nand closing with\nAs-Salamu ‘Alaykum\n.\n[2]\nThe\nrequirements are flexible for the sick and the traveler.  A menstruating women\nis excused from the prayer.  We will learn about them later, God-willing.\n[3]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[4]\nAs\ncollected by Imam Ahmad, Nisai, and Ibn Majah.\n[5]\nCompulsory charity required of wealthy Muslims.\n[6]\nTabarani\n#???"

The Friday\nprayer\ncannot\nbe done at home or prayed individually. That is why\nMuslims gather in a central mosque to pray and listen to a sermon, known as\nkhutbah\nin Arabic. It is common for a designated\nImam\n(prayer leader) to give\nthe\nkhutbah\n, but sometimes this is done by invited guests or general members\nof a community.\nIn the West, sermons are mostly delivered\nin English, however sometimes they are only in Arabic. In any case, at least\npart of the sermon is always in Arabic. The sermon is made of two parts. After\nthe first part is over, the\nkhatib\n(person delivering the\nkhutbah\n)\ntakes a short break and sits, and then resumes it. The quality of a sermon\ngreatly differs depending on the speaker who might be a knowledgeable scholar\nof Islam or a lay person. The speaker will praise Allah and then discuss issues\nrelevant to the Muslim community. Afterwards, the\nImam\nwill lead the\ncongregation in a short prayer of two\nrakahs\n.\nSalat ul-Jumuah\n(the\nsermon and the prayer), usually lasts for an hour or less.\nMen Must Pray\nSalat ul-Jumuah\nThe Friday prayer is compulsory and\nrequired from all Muslim\nmen\n. This is based on the Quran in which Allah\nsays,\n“O you who believe, when the call to prayer (\nAdhan\n)\nis proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and\nleave trade aside. That is better for you, if you did but know.” (Quran 62:9)\nProphet Muhammad has stated very\nclearly who is required to pray\nSalat ul-Jumuah\nand who is exempt:\n“The Friday prayer in congregation\nis an obligatory duty on every Muslim except four: a slave, a woman, a child,\nand a sick person.”\n[1]\nTo be precise, Friday prayer is\nrequired from every Muslim male who has reached puberty. Others can attend it,\nbut are not sinful if they don’t.\nAdditionally, Prophet Muhammad has\ngiven a stern warning against missing the Friday prayers. He said,\n“People should stop missing Friday\nprayers otherwise Allah will put a seal on their hearts and thus they will be\namong the heedless.”\n[2]\nA Muslim man who is sick or travelling\nmay miss the Friday prayer. A Muslim woman is not required to pray the Friday\nprayer, but she is allowed to attend the prayers if she wants to. Most mosques have\nseparate seating arrangements for women, but some may lack women’s area for\npraying the Friday prayer. Also, the women who decide not to attend the\nSalat\nul-Jumuah\nshould offer the regular\nDhuhr\nprayer at home.\nWisdom Behind Friday Prayer\n1.    The Friday prayer brings\nlocal Muslims together in one place on a fixed day, thereby increasing the\nbonds of brotherhood between Muslims.\n2.    The purpose of the\nkhutbah\n(sermon) is to educate the Muslims and serves as a weekly reminder about their duties\nto Allah and fellow human beings. It warns against sin and disobeying Allah,\nand encourages to be good and to obey Allah.\n3.    The topics are varied and\noften update the Muslims on current affairs and as Muslim what should be their\nrole.\nVirtues of Friday\nFriday is a virtuous day with many\nspecial qualities.\n1.    Prophet Muhammad said:\n“When it is a Friday, the angels\nstand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons\ncoming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of\nthe one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a\ncamel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a\nram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out\n(for the Friday prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the\nKhutbah\n.”\n[3]\nThis narration shows the reward of\ncoming early to the Friday prayer. The earlier a person arrives, the greater\nhis reward. The first arrival attains the reward of sacrificing a camel for\nAllah, but those who arrive later receive lesser rewards.\n2.    He also said:\n“The best day on which the sun has\never risen is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted into\nParadise, and on it he was expelled from it, and the Hour will not be\nestablished except on Friday.”\n[4]\nThe purpose of this narration is to tell\nus of the magnificent events that took place on Friday or will take place.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nAbu Dawood\n[2]\nSaheeh Muslim\n[3]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[4]\nSaheeh Muslim"

In this lesson, we will describe how to\nperform ablution in a little more detail, and mention the\nahadith\nfrom\nwhich this method is derived.\nArabic Terms\n·\nNafl\n- a voluntary act of worship\n·\nHadith\n- (plural –\nahadith\n) is\na piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the\nsayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.\n·\nWudoo\n– ablution.\nThe Virtues of Ablution\nBy the ultimate grace of Allah,\nHe commands us with certain obligations, and then also rewards us for their\nfulfillment. Performing ablution as well has many virtues associated with it,\nfrom forgiveness of sins to it being a mark of recognition on the Day of Judgment.\nThe following are an example of some of the\nahadith\nwhich mention these\nrewards.\n(1)  Messenger of Allah,\nmay the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“When a Muslim or a\nbeliever performs ablution and washes his face, every lesser sin that he\ncommitted as a result of looking washes away with water (or with the last drop\nof water). When he washes his hands, every sin that his hands committed washes\naway with water (or with the last drop of water). When he washes his feet,\nevery sin to which he proceeded washes away with water (or with the last drop\nof water) until he emerges pure and sin free..” (\nMuslim\n)\n(2)  Messenger of Allah said:\n“Shall I inform you (of an\nact) by which Allah erases sins and raises degrees?  They (his Companions) said,\n‘Certainly, O Messenger of Allah.’  He said, ‘Perfecting the ablution under\ndifficult circumstances, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for the\n(next) prayer after the (last) prayer has been performed.  That is\nribat\n[1]\n.’” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\n(3)  Messenger of Allah\npassed by a grave site and said:\n“Peace be upon you, the\nabode of the believing people, and soon we as well, if Allah so wills, are\nabout to join you. I love to see my brothers.”\nThey (his Companions)\nsaid: “Aren’t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah?”\nHe said: “You are my\nCompanions; our brothers are those who have not yet come into the world.”\nThey said: “O Messenger of\nAllah, how would you recognize those persons of your nation [on the Day of\nJudgment] who have not yet been born?”\nHe replied: “Suppose a man\nhad horses with white blazes on their foreheads and legs among other horses\nwhich were all black. Tell me, would he not recognize his own horses?”\nThey said: “Certainly, O\nMessenger of Allah.”\nHe said: “They [those who\nhave not come yet] will come with white faces, arms and legs owing to ablution,\nand I will arrive at the Cistern\n[2]\nbefore them. Some people will be driven away from my Cistern as a\nstray camel is driven away. I will call out: ‘Come, come.’ Then it will be said\n(to me): ‘These people changed [the religion by innovating in it] after you,’\nand I will say: ‘Be off, be off.’” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nOn the Day of Judgment, the\nMuslim nation will be distinguished from other nations by the body parts which\nthey washed for ablution which will be emanating with light:\n“My people will be called\nto presence on the Day of Judgment with bright faces, arms and legs from the\ntraces of ablution.” (\nal-Bukhari\n)\nThe Method of Performing Ablution\nAllah, the Exalted, says\nin the Quran:\n“O you who believe! When\nyou intend to offer the prayer, wash your faces and from your hands up to the\nelbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.” (Quran 5:6)\nProphet Muhammad also said:\n“Allah does not accept any\nprayer performed without being in a state of purity.”\n(Muslim)\nThe Prophet practically taught\nus how to perform ablution, as he was sent to explain the revelation of the\nQuran. The following is a step by step guide explaining what exactly is to be\nwashed and how, gathered from various texts of\nhadith\n.\n(1)  You must have the\nintention of purifying yourself from a state of ritual impurity\n[3]\n.  This means that you\nshould bring into your mind that you are performing this\nwudoo\nin order\nto enter a state of ritual purity. This intention is in the heart and is\nnot\nto be\nuttered.\n(2)  Begin with the name\nof Allah, by saying ‘\nBismillaah\n’.\n(3)  Then, wash your hands\nthree times each. You should always start with the right whenever washing the\nbody parts..\n(4)  Rinse your mouth\nthree times, swirling the water around inside your mouth (gargling), and then rinse\nyour nose three times by inhaling some water into your nostrils and blowing the\nwater out. Use your left hand to remove the water from your nose.\n(5)  Wash your face three\ntimes, from the hairline to the jawbone and chin, and from ear to ear.  A man\nshould wet the hair of his beard because it is part of the face.  If his beard\nis thin he has to wash it inside and out, and if it is thick and covers the\nskin, it is sufficient to wash the surface and run his wet fingers through it.\n("

If\none breaks his\nwudoo\nafter performing\nghusl\n, it is sufficient to\nmake new\nwudoo\nwithout bathing again.\n(2)      For the Bi-Annual Eid prayers.\nA Muslim is encouraged to perform\nghusl\nfor\nEid\nprayers.  Many reports from the Companions have been reported regarding\nthis matter.\n(3)      On entering Mecca.\nIt is preferable for whoever wants to enter Mecca to perform\nghusl\n.\n[2]\n(4)\nGhusl\nafter washing a corpse.\nPerforming\nghusl\nis preferred for one who\nhas washed a corpse.\n[3]\nGhusl\nfor Women\nA woman bathes as outlined above, except that if\nshe has braided hair she does not have to undo it, provided the water can reach\nthe roots of her hair.\n[4]\nIt\nis sufficient for her to pour water over her head three times, making sure that\nthe water completely reaches the roots of her hair.\nAlso, nail polish or any other agent which prevents\nwater from reaching the body parts must be removed at the time of\nghusl\n.\n[5]\nIt is preferable for a woman, after performing\nghusl\ndue to menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding, to take some cotton smeared\nwith fragrance and wipe her private parts, in order to cleanse herself from the\nodor of the menstrual blood.\n[6]\nGhusl\nis not required in the following\ntwo cases:\n(i)   Normal vaginal discharge.  It is\nnormal for a vagina to be naturally moist with a kind of mucus.  It changes\nthroughout the monthly cycle in response to the body’s hormone production.  Most\nnormal young and older women have a white, sticky discharge called leucorrhea,\na liquid quite distinct from orgasmic fluid.  It’s normal for women to get a\nlittle discharge on their clothing.  The secretions can be more inclined to\nwetness or dryness, and be more or less thick or viscous.  These secretions may\nturn white or yellow when exposed to the air.  Normal vaginal fluids can have a\nmild scent, or no aroma at all, and can be clear or milky white when moist,\nyellowish in color when dried, and mucus-like or stringy in consistency.  They\ncan be heavier during mid-cycle, when ovulation occurs, during pregnancy, and\nwhen using birth control pills.\nGhusl\nis not required in such cases.\n(ii)  Foreplay, thinking about intercourse\nand sexual arousal causes veins to dilate.  This swelling creates a “sweating\nreaction,” producing a fluid that lubricates the vagina and wets the entrance. \nThe combination of vaginal mucus and lubrication makes up women’s sexual\nsecretions.  It can be white and thin and is\nnot\nfollowed by feeling of\nexhaustion.  This fluid is called\nmadhiy\nin Arabic.\nGhusl\nis not\nrequired in this case as well.\nA woman is considered sexually impure and must\nperform\nghusl\nin two cases:\n(a)  Insertion of the penis in the vagina,\neven if there is no ejaculation, renders both husband and wife sexually impure. \nBoth require\nghusl\nto resume worship.\n(b)  Emission of the vaginal fluid called\nmaniy\ndue to wet-dream\n[7]\nand\nfemale orgasm.\nA woman has to do\nghusl\nif she\nexperiences an erotic dream and notices\nmoisture\nwhen she wakes up.\nAlso,\nghusl\nbecomes obligatory when\nmaniy\nis produced after female orgasm due to any other reason for that matter.  Orgasm\nis the climax of sexual activity accompanied by vaginal contractions and other\nchanges in the body, and commonly results from sexual intercourse.\n[8]\nCertain indicators like smell and color\ndistinguish\nmaniy\nfrom normal vaginal discharge.  Women’s\nmaniy\n,\nthe fluid which requires\nghusl\n, is known by several qualities:\n(a)  it is released as a result of feeling\nsexual pleasure and a woman feels excitement when it is produced.\n(b)  it is followed by a feeling of\nexhaustion.\n(c)  it has a particular odor.\n[9]\n(d)  it is usually yellow and non-viscous.

    "fullText": "Objective:\n·To learn ten etiquettes and duties on\nFriday.\nArabic Terms:\n·Salat\nul-Jumuah\n- Friday Prayer.\n·\nDhuhr\n- the afternoon prayer.\n·\nKhutbah\n- sermon.\n·\nRakah\n- unit of prayer.\n·\nImam\n- someone who leads the prayer.\n·\nAdhan\n- an Islamic way of calling Muslims to the five\nobligatory prayers.\nEtiquette and Duties on Friday\n1.       Wear Clean Clothes & Smell Good\nProphet Muhammad said,\n“Every Muslim should have a ritual bath on Friday and wear his best clothing,\nand if he has perfume, he should use it”\n[1]\n2.       Send Blessings on the Prophet\nIt is highly recommended to send peace and blessings on\nProphet Muhammad on Fridays as the Prophet said,\n“Invoke blessings on me,\nmany times over, on Friday and the night (preceding it); for whoever does so, I\nwill be a witness and intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.”\n[2]\nThis is done by simply saying and repeating the words,\n“\nAllahumma\nsal-ly wa sal-lim ‘Ala Muhammad\n.”\nRepeating these simple words anytime\nduring Friday brings great blessings as mentioned in the above report form\nProphet Muhammad.\n3.       Increase Supplication\nA Muslim should increase his supplication to Allah on\nFriday because there is a time on Friday when Allah responds and gives whatever\ngood He is asked for. The Prophet said,\n“There is an hour on Friday in which\nno Muslim asks during it except that Allah grants him whatever he asks for.”\n[3]\nOne can supplicate in any language he wants. The\netiquettes of supplication have been covered in previous lessons.\n4.       Arrive Early at the Mosque\nProphet Muhammad said,\n“Whoever takes a bath on\nFriday like the one taken to purify oneself from sexual impurity, then he\nleaves at the earliest time, then he is like the one who offers a camel; the\none who comes after that is like one who offers a cow; the one who comes after\nthat is like one who offers a horned ram; the one who comes after that is like\none who offers a chicken; the one who comes after that is like one who offers\nan egg. When the\nImam\narrives, the angels are present to listen to the\nremembrance (meaning the\nkhutbah\n).”\n[4]\nIf a person comes late, he should not step over people\nalready sitting in rows, nor separate two people sitting together. He should\nalso not move another person and take their place. A Muslim should not walk\ndirectly in front of a person praying.\n5.       Sit Close to the\nImam\nA person must try to arrive early and sit close to the\nImam\ndelivering the sermon. Sitting closer to the\nImam\nis better than sitting\nbehind in the back rows or reclining next to a wall. If a new Muslim finds it\nhard to sit on the floor for half an hour or so, he may sit where ever he feels\ncomfortable, but he should try to get accustomed to sitting closer to the\nImam\n.\n6.       Don’t Talk During the\nKhutbah\nAlso, a Muslim should pay attention to the sermon and\nnot talk during it, even if it is delivered in Arabic. Talking during the\nFriday prayer is a serious matter. Prophet Muhammad said,\n“If you say to\nyour friend, ‘Be quiet,’ on Friday when the\nImam\nis delivering the\nsermon, then you have uttered non-sense.”\n[5]\nIn another narration, the Prophet said,\n“…whoever\nutters nonsense is considered as if he has not attended the Friday prayer!”\n[6]\n7.       Pray Two\nRakahs\nFor Entering the Mosque\nBefore Sitting Down\nIf you arrive to the mosque early, you should pray two\nrakahs\nbefore sitting down. If you arrive while the\nImam\nis delivering the\nsermon, you should still pray them, but make it short. The Prophet said,\n“If\nanyone of you enters the mosque on Friday while the\nImam\nis delivering\nthe\nkhutbah\n, let him perform two\nrakahs\nand be brief in doing\nso.”\n[7]\n8.       Don’t Buy or Sell Once the\nAdhan\nHas Been\nCalled\nThis prohibition is based on the Quran itself,\n“... when the\nAdhan\nis proclaimed for the prayer on\nFriday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trading aside...” (Quran 62:9)\n9.    The Friday prayer which consists of two\nrakahs\nis performed after the sermon behind an\nImam\n. Someone who misses it\nshould pray four\nrakahs\nof regular\nDhuhr\nprayer.\n10.  You can pray two or four\nrakahs\nof\nSunnah\n(recommended) prayer after the Friday prayer.\nMaking Arrangements with the Employer for Time Off for\nSalat\nul-Jumuah\nCountless Muslims take time off from their businesses,\nschools, and employers to attend the Friday prayer. Friday prayer is a\nreligious obligation and a new Muslim should make arrangements with their\nschool or employer to take time off for attending it. You can make up the lost\nhours by working extra during the week or staying late on Friday.\n[8]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n[2]\nBaihaqi\n[3]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[4]\nMuwatta\n[5]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[6]\nAbu\nDawood\n[7]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[8]\nContact the following organizations for more information or help:\n(www.cair.com)\n(www.caircan.ca)\n(www.amcran.org)\nIf your country is not listed, you can contact a\nMuslim civil rights organization in your country for help and guidance."

She need not cover her hands and face.\n3.    A Muslim must be in\nthe state of purity, meaning the person:\n·should perform\nwudoo\n(ablution)\nif he has passed wind, urinated, defecated or woke up from sleep since the last\ntime he performed\nwudoo\n.\n·should perform the\nghusl\n(ritual bath) if he woke up from a wet-dream, ejaculated semen, had intercourse\nand additionally, in case of a woman, she ended her monthly cycle or her\npost-childbirth bleeding.\n4.    He must make sure\nthere is no impurity on his clothes, body, or the spot he will pray.\n5.    He should face the direction\nof prayer (\nqiblah\n).\n6.    Make intention to\nperform the prayers in the heart.\n7.    The formal prayer\n(salah\n) must be offered in Arabic, so please read the transliteration of\nthe Arabic text provided at the end of ‘Prayer for Beginners (part 2 of 2)’.\nThe translation is given just to help know what you are saying.\n(Disclaimer: All links are\nprovided for educational purposes only.  NewMuslims.com is not responsible for\nthe content of external websites.)\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSee: http://www.alfajr.com/en/index.html"

It is basically washing of one's face, hands and arms,\nthen wiping the head and ears, and finally washing the feet.\nWhen Should I Perform Ablution (\nWudoo\n)?\nA Muslim must perform ablution before he performs\nthe prayer (\nsalah\n) if he enters a state of ritual impurity, namely due\nto one of the following causes:\n(1)  Breaking wind.\n(2)  Urination.\n(3)  Defecation (passing feces).\n(4)  Deep sleep.\nThese things are considered to ‘invalidate’ or\n‘break’ ablution (\nwudoo\n).  For example, you must perform ablution after waking\nup in the morning to pray your morning prayer (\nsalah\n), because sleeping\n“breaks” the  ablution. After using the toilet, you have to perform  ablution before\nyou can perform prayer because urinating and defecating “break” the  ablution.\nHow to Perform Ablution?\nBefore you perform ablution, you should make\nsure your body parts are not soiled with impurities. Make sure you have wiped\noff all traces of urine or feces with toilet paper or water after having used\nthe toilet.\nAblution is done in the following order:\n1.    Intend in your heart that you are\nperforming  ablution in order to enter a state of purity for\nsalah\n.\n2.    Begin with the name of Allah by\nsaying,\n‘Bismillaah’\nwhich means,\n‘I begin with\nthe Name of Allah.’\n3.    Rinse the mouth. This can be done\n  once, twice or thrice. See Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n4.    Clean the nostrils by sniffing\n  water and blowing it. This can be done once, twice or thrice. See Figure 2.\nFigure 2\n5.    Wash the face from the hairline to\n  the chin and jawbone, from ear to ear. This can be done once, twice or\n  thrice. See Figure 3.\nFigure 3\n6.    Wash the hands and arms up to and\n  including the elbows. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the\n  right hand.  See Figure 4.\nFigure 4\n7.    After wetting the hands again, wipe\n  the entire head by putting the hands at the front of your head and take them\n  to the back of the head, then bring them back to the place where you\n  started.  This is to be done only once. See Figure 5.\nFigure 5\n8.    Wipe the inner part of the ears\n  with the index fingers and the back of the ears with the thumbs. This is to\n  be done only once. See Figure 6.\nFigure 6\n9.    Wash the feet up to and including\n  the ankles. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the right\n  foot. See Figure 7.\nFigure 7\nWhat is Ritual Bath (\nGhusl\n)?\nGhusl\nis the Arabic word for a complete\nbath. In certain cases, it is not enough to perform ablution before prayers.  One\nneeds to purify themselves by taking a full bath, that is doing the ritual bath\n(\nghusl\n), before they may pray.  You are required to do the ritual bath\nin the following cases:\n1.\nThe emission of semen or female orgasmic\nfluid, whether due to sexual intercourse, wet dreams or masturbation.\n2.\nAfter sexual intercourse.  More\nprecisely, a bath has to be taken if the penis enters the vagina, regardless of\nwhether fluid was emitted or not.\n3.\nMenstruation and post-natal bleeding\n[1]\n.\n4.\nIt is also preferred to perform theritual\nbath upon entering Islam.\nA female cannot offer\nsalah\n(prayer) when\nshe is experiencing menstruation or postpartum bleeding.  After her bleeding\nends, she must purify herself by taking the ritual bath, and then she may resume\nsalah\n(prayer).\nHow to Perform the Ritual Bath\n(1) Intend in your heart to purify yourself\nfor Allah’s sake.\n(2) Wash off any impurity that may be on\nthe body.\n(3) Wash the entire body with water leaving\nno part dry.\n(4) Rinse the mouth and nose.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nPost-natal or post partum bleeding is that bleeding which occurs\nafter childbirth or miscarriage."

They are\nFajr\n,\nDhuhr\n,\nAsr\n,\nMagrib\nand\nIsha\n, and you can find the prayer timings for your\ncity from this link:\nhttp://www.islamicfinder.org/\nThe timings of the prayers vary from place to\nplace. And this is why you need to find the prayer timings for your specific\ncity.\nThe prayers do not need to be prayed exactly\nwhen the time starts; rather, they can be prayed at any time before the next\nprayer time starts, with the exception of\nFajr\nand\nIsha.\nThe\nFajr\nprayer should be prayed before sunrise. For this reason, you will find the\ntime for sunrise listed on Prayer schedules, and this does not mean that there\nis a special prayer for Sunrise.  And the\nIsha\nprayer should be prayed\ntill the middle of the night. However, due to necessity, the\nIsha\nprayer\ncan be prayed up to the beginning of\nFajr\ntime.\nThe direction\n: You can use the same\nwebsite to find the direction of prayers. The website will display the bearing\non a compass after you have entered your city.\nThe dress\n: A Muslim man should wear\nsomething that at least covers him from the navel to the knees. A Muslim woman\nmust wear loose clothing that covers her entire body and hair leaving her face\nand palms open.\nState of Purity\n: One should be in a state\nof purity, by performing ablution (\nwudoo’\n) or ritual bath (\nghusl\n)\n[this was covered in Part 1]. Also one should make sure that there is no\nimpurity (such as urine or faeces) on one’s clothes or body. The prayers can be\ndone on any clean surface such as the floor, carpet or a rug. Dust, mud or\ngrease are considered ok and do not affect the prayers.\nThe Prayer (\nSalah\n)\nThe Prayer(\nsalah\n) is to be said\nin Arabic and requires some memorization, so, it usually takes a little time to\nlearn correctly and fully and get used to it.  Not knowing Arabic should not discourage\nyou; just pray the prayer (\nsalah\n) to the best of your ability.\nA new Muslim has to realize that the orders of\nAllah are to be followed within the limit of his or her ability and endurance. \nIf you find it difficult to memorize all of what is necessary for the prayers,\nit may be a good idea in the meantime to write it on a piece of paper and read\nthem in prayer.  If you are unable to do even this, it is sufficient that you\nsay any or all of the following instead:\n·\nSubhanallah\n‘How Perfect is Allah!’\n·\nAl-hamdu lil-lah\n‘All\npraise and thanks are for Allah’\n·\nLa ilaha il-lal-lah\n‘There is no god except Allah’\n·\nAllahu Akbar\n‘Allah\nis the Greatest’\nHere is an example of a\n2 unit prayer (like the\nFajr\nprayer), based on the last method of\nprayers explained above.\n1.  Stand\nstraight facing the direction of prayer.\n2.  Raise\n  your hands up to the shoulders and say\nAllahu Akbar\n.\n  See Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n3.  Then\n  place your right arm over your left arm and place both of them on the chest.\n  In the standing position, say\nSubhanallah\n.\n  See Figure 2.\nFigure 2\n4.  Then\n  say\nAllahu Akbar\nand go to the\n  bowing position. See Figure 3. In the bowing position say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 3\n5.  Then\n  get up from the bowing position to stand straight again. Say\nAllahu Akbar\nwhile getting up.\n  See Figure 4. Here say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 4\n6.  Then\n  go to the position of prostration. See Figure 5. Say\nAllahu Akbar\nwhile going down.\n  In the position of prostration say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 5\n7.  Then\n  come to the sitting position as in Figure 6. While sitting up, say\nAllahu Akbar\n. In the sitting\n  position say\nSubhanallah\n.\nFigure 6\n8.   Then\n  again go to the position of prostration (see figure 5).  Say\nAllahu Akbar\nwhile going down.\n  In the position of prostration say\nSubhanallah\n.\n9.   Stand\n  up again while saying\nAllahu Akbar\nand repeat Step 3\n  to 8.\n10. Then\n  come to the sitting position as in Figure 6. While sitting up, say\nAllahu Akbar\n.\n  In the sitting position say\nSubhanallah\n.\n11. Then conclude the\n  prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying\nAs-salaamu alaikum\n.

Before making\ntayammum\n, you should try to get appropriate\nwater from any accessible place you can find it.  Only if you cannot find good water,\nor it is too far away, can you make\ntayammum\n.\n‘Imran bin Husain, one of the companions of Prophet\nMuhammad said,\n“We were with the Messenger of Allah during a journey.  When\nhe led the people in prayer, one man stayed apart.  He asked him, “What\nprevented you from praying?”  He said, ‘I need a purifying bath and there is not\nsufficient water.’  He said, ‘Use the soil, for it is sufficient.’’’\n[3]\n(2)  Injury or illness.\nYou may perform\ntayammum\nif you think using water\nwill worsen your disease based on past experience or the doctor’s advice. A\nperson hospitalized who is unable to make\nwudoo\n, may keep a bag with\nsome clean soil to make\ntayammum\n.\n(3)  If the water is harmful to you because it is too\ncold and for some reason you cannot heat it up.\n‘Amr ibn al-’Aas narrated that he was participating in\nan expedition.  He had a wet dream during an extremely cold night, and was\nafraid that if he performed\nghusl\nhe would die.  He prayed the morning\nprayer with his companions.  He then went to the Messenger of Allah to ask him\nabout this.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsaid,\n“O ‘Amr, did you pray with your companions while you needed a purifying\nbath?”\n‘Amr mentioned the verse,\n“Do not kill yourselves, Allah is\nmerciful to you”\nto the Prophet.  The Prophet just smiled and didn’t say\nanything.\n[4]\n(4)  If the water is nearby, but you cannot reach\nit due to fear.\n(5)  If you have water, but you need it for\ncooking, or are saving it for use later.  For example, this may arise while\ncamping.  Many of the companions would save their drinking water and performed\ntayammum\n.\n(6)  If you fear the time for\nsalah\n(ritual\nprayer) will be over by the time you get to water.\nHow to Perform\nTayammum\n1.    You must have the intention of purifying yourself\nand removing impurity.  The intention is in the heart and is not uttered.\n2.    Say ‘\nBismillah\n’ (I begin with the name\nof Allah).\n3.    Gently touch the ground or a dusty surface\nwith the palms of both hands.\n4.    Blow on the hands and shake off any access,\nso as not to make the face dusty.\n5.    Wipe the palms together, then the face, and then\nthe palms and backs of the hands up to the wrists.\nAmmar, Prophet’s companion, said, “We became sexually\nimpure and had no water, so we rolled in the dirt as does an animal and prayed.” \nThis was mentioned to the Prophet and he said:\n“This would"

More\nspecifically, in Islam it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the\nmost important form of worship.\n·\nTakbiratul-Ihram – saying ‘Allahu Akbar’\nthat commences the prayer.\n·\nTashahhud\n- the saying “\nAt-tahiy-yatu\nlil-lahi…. Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasuluh\n.” in the sitting position of the\nprayer.\n·\nTasleem\n- The salutation of peace\nthat ends the prayer.\n·\nWajib\n- (plural:\nwajibaat\n)\nobligatory.\nMeaning\nThe Arabic word for prostration is ‘\nsajdah\n.’ It means to put\none’s head, hands, knees, and toes on the ground. The two\nsajdahs\nmade\nat the end of\nsalah\nto make up for major errors are known as the\n‘prostration of forgetfulness’ or\nsajdah as-sahw\nin Arabic.\nImportance\nWe human beings are forgetful by nature and even forget\nwhen we are praying to Allah. Our Creator is well aware of that fact and He\nmade His Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, forget on\nsome occasions in the prayer. This way the Prophet showed us how to correct our\nmistakes in the prayer. Making up for our mistakes in prayer is a great mercy\nfrom Allah because He could have made us repeat the prayer for every mistake,\nbut He did not.\nWhen Are Prostrations of Forgetfulness Required?\nThey are two occasions when they\nare required:\nI.When\nyou add or subtract to the acts of\nsalah\n.\nExamples of addition:\nYou pray 5\nrakahs\ninstead of 4.\nYou do three\nprostrations instead of two.\nYou make\ntashahhud\nat the end of first\nrakah.\nExample of subtraction:\nYou pray 3\nrakahs\ninstead of 4.\nYou do one\nsajdah\ninstead of two.\nYou get up for the third\nrakah\nwithout doing the first\ntashahhud.\nII.When\nyou forget the number of\nrakahs\nand are in doubt, (for example) whether\nyou prayed three of four\nrakahs\n.\nMissing a\nRukn\n(Essential Component or Pillar of\nSalah\n)\nIf you omit the\nTakbiratul-Ihram\n, then there is\nno prayer for you, regardless of whether you left it intentionally or due to\nforgetfulness, because you never started the prayer.\nIf you omit a\nrukn\nother than the\nTakbiratul-Ihram\ndeliberately, your\nsalah\nis invalid.\nIf you left a\nrukn\nout of forgetfulness and you\nreached the next\nrakah\n, then the\nrakah\nin which you left the\nrukn\nis invalid and the following\nrakah\ntakes its place.\nIf you did not reach the next\nrakah\n, you must\nreturn to the\nrukn\nyou omitted and perform it and follow it by what\ncomes after it in the course of the\nsalah\n.\nIn both of the above situations, you offer the “prostration\nof forgetfulness”.\nMissing a\nWajib\n(Obligatory act of\nsalah\n)\nIf you leave out something\nwajib\nunintentionally,\nlike the first\ntashahhud\nor a prostration, you simply do\nsajdah\nas-sahw\nat the conclusion of prayer.  However, it is left intentionally,\nthen the prayer is invalid.\nMissing a Recommended Act in Prayer\nYou do not have to make the “prostration of\nforgetfulness” if you forget to perform one of the recommended acts of prayer.\nMethod of\nSajdah as-sahw\nYou have a choice between two\nways of doing it:\n1.    Immediately\nbefore\ntasleem\nat\nthe end of\nsalah.\nBefore concluding the prayer with\ntasleem\n, you\nsay\nAllahu Akbar\n, and then make the first prostration.\nIn the prostration you say,\nSubha-na Rabbi al-A\n'la\nthree times. Then you say\nAllahu Akbar\nand return to the sitting\nposition.\nThen you say\nAllahu Akbar\nagain and make the\nsecond prostration and say the same words as you did in the first prostration.\nYou then say\nAllahu Akbar\nfor the last time,\nreturn to the sitting position, and turn your head to the right and then to the\nleft, saying each time “\nAs-Salamu\n'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah\n.”\n2.    Doing it\nafter\ntasleem.\nAnother way is to continue your\nsalah\nand end it\nwith\ntasleem\nas you normally would.\nAfter that you say\nAllahu Akbar\nand prostrate for\nyour first prostration, and say\nSubha-na Rabbi al-A\n'la\nthree\ntimes. Then you say\nAllahu Akbar\nand return to the sitting position.\nThen you say\nAllahu Akbar\nagain and do your\nsecond prostration and say\nSubha-na Rabbi al-A\n'la\nthree times.\nFinally, you say\nAllahu Akbar\nthe last time and\nreturn to the sitting position, and then turn your face to the right saying “\nAs-Salamu\n'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah\n.”\nFurther Notes/Examples\n1.    If you realize before making\ntasleem\nthat you have added anything to the\nsalah\n, for example an extra\nrakah\n,\nyou may do\nsajdah as-sahw\nbefore or after\ntasleem\n.\n2.    If you did not pray one or more\nrakah\n,\nyou"

faces\nduring the formal prayers.\n·\nWudoo\n– ablution.\n·\nSalam\n- The Islamic greeting such as '\nAs-Salamu\nAlaikum\n'.\nSomething as mundane as\nrelieving oneself is tied to a Muslim’s sense of cleanliness and modesty.  There\nis nothing odd or strange about it, as Islam literally is all encompassing,\nsomething that evokes a pleasant surprise in some people.  Even in the time of\nthe Prophet, there was a polytheist who exclaimed with astonishment to Salman,\nthe Persian, “Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to\ndefecate\n!”\n Salman responded, ‘“Yes, he forbade us to face the direction of Mecca\nwhen urinating or defecating…”\n[1]\nIn this lesson we will detail the\nmanners of relieving oneself, something apparently minor, but implies much about\npersonal hygiene and religious observance.\n(A)   Supplications before Relieving\nOneself\nThere are certain supplications\none should recite when entering or leaving the place one relieves oneself,\nwhether it be in a bathroom or in nature.\n(a)  One should say “\nBismillah\n”\n(I begin with the Name of Allah) before entering, because the Messenger of\nAllah said:\n“The eyes of the\njinn\nare blocked from seeing the nakedness of the sons of Adam when one of them says\nbefore entering the place for relieving oneself, ‘\nBismillah\n.’” (\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\n(b)\nAllah-humma\ninnee a’oodhu bika min al-khubuthi wa’l-kha-baa’ith\n.\n“O Allah, I seek refuge\nwith You from male and female devils.” (\nAbu Daud\n,\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\nEnter with your left foot.\n(B)   Inside the Toilet\nFacing the\nQibla\nOut of respect a Muslim should\nnot face the\nqiblah\n[2]\nwhen urinating or defecating.  The Messenger of Allah said:\n“When any one of you sits\ndown to answer the call of nature, he should not face the\nqiblah\nor turn\nhis back towards it.” (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nConcealment\nWe must conceal ourselves from\nthe sight of others when answering the call of nature.  The Messenger of Allah\npreferred to go behind a rise on the ground or a garden of date palms.\n[3]\nIf a person is in the\nopen and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call\nof nature, he should move away from public sight.  One of the Companions\ndescribed how he was with the Prophet on a journey, and when the Prophet felt\nthe need to answer the call of nature, he went far away.\n[4]\nWhen outdoors, one should not\nuncover their private parts until they squat close to the ground, as it is more\nconcealing.\n[5]\nIndoors, first make sure you have closed the door and are out of sight.\n(C)   Relieving Oneself\nSquatting\nOutdoors, it is best to answer\nthe call of nature sitting.  It is better to adopt a posture that is more\nconcealing, one which will cause no splash-back on yourself or your clothes.  If\nthere is a need and a person does not fear splash-back, it is permissible to\nurinate standing up.\nSplash-Back\nOne must take great care to avoid\nthe splash-back of urine, both on themselves and their clothes.  If urine or\nstool soils some part of body or clothes, those areas must also be washed, and\nthe impurity must be totally removed from them.  The Messenger of Allah passed\nby two graves, and said:\n“Indeed they are being\npunished, but for something which seemed trivial to them: this one used not to\nguard himself from urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious\ngossip.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nProhibited Places\nIslam forbids urinating in\nplaces where people might pass by, or seek shade therein, such a park, because it\nis something disturbing to people.  The Prophet said, “\nFear the two things\nthat bring curses\n.”  They asked, “What are the two things that bring\ncurses, O Messenger of Allah?”\nHe said:\n“When a person relieves\nhimself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade.” (\nAbu\nDaud\n)\nAlso, it is forbidden to urinate\nin stagnant water, as it was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah.\n[6]\nIt obviously makes the\nwater impure and will disturb those who use it.\nConversation\nDon’t say, ‘\nAs-Salamu Alaikum’\nto a person who is answering the call of nature, or reply with ‘\nWa Alaikum Assalam\n’\nwhile relieving yourself, out of respect for God’s name.\nAl-Salaam\nis one\nof Allah’s beautiful Names.\nA man passed by the Prophet while\nhe was urinating, and greeted him with\nSalam\n.  The Messenger of Allah\nsaid to him:\n“If you see me in this\nstate, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond.” (\nIbn Majah\n)\nIt is disliked to speak while\nrelieving oneself unnecessarily.\nUrinals\nUrinals should be avoided for\nfour reasons.  First, there is no privacy.  Private parts are exposed, which is\nindecent and forbidden.  Second, it is almost impossible to avoid splash-back. \nThird, there is no toilet paper. Fourth, people sometimes talk while urinating,\nan activity better left outside the toilet!\n(D)   Cleaning Method\n(a)      Using the Left Hand\nThe Prophet’s wife H"

 He will even use matters of the\ndeen\nmaking you think\nabout anything other than the prayer.\nEight easy ways for gaining and maintaining\nkhushoo\n.\n1)Prepare for prayer properly.  You can do this\nby repeating the words of the\nadhan\nand making\ndu’a\n.  Paying\nattention to your ablution and all the time remembering Allah\n.\nAlso\nmaking sure that your clothes and place of prayer are clean and tidy.  Allah is\nof course the most deserving of our clean attire and surroundings.\n2)Move calmly to the place of prayer and also during\nthe prayer.  Do not move through the positions of prayer like a chicken pecking\nat the ground.  Haste prevents\nkhushoo\n.\n3)Remember death and what awaits us after death. \nProphet Muhammad said, “Remember death in your prayer, for the man who\nremembers death is bound to pray properly and pray the prayer of a man who does\nnot think that he will prayer any other prayer”.\n[2]\n4)Think about the words of the prayer and the\nrecited verses of the Quran.  The Quran was revealed to be pondered over.  It\nwould be helpful to read a\ntafseer\n.  Pause at the end of each\nayah\nand even interact with the words.  For instance when Prophet Muhammad recited\nan ayah that mentioned glorification he said\nSubhanAllah\n, if the\nayah\nmentioned seeking refugee with Allah he would seek refuge with Allah.\n[3]\n5)Recite in a slow rhythmic tone and try to\nbeautify your voice.  Allah says in Quran,\n“…And recite the Quran in a slow\npleasant style.” (Quran 73:4)\nA slow measured pace is more conducive to\nreflection.\n6)Keep in mind that Allah responds to prayers.  Prayer\nis a connection and con"

Women must understand\nthe rulings pertinent to each type, as they deal with important aspects of\nworship, such as purification, prayer and fasting. This lesson will try to\nexplain the most important rulings relevant to each type of bleeding.\nMenstruation\nMenstruation is the release of blood\nand tissue through the vagina that occurs on a monthly cycle, not due to\nspecific events such as birth or breakage of the hymen.  Menstrual periods\nusually occur once a month and last for several days.  Blood loss due to\nmenstrual flow may vary from month to month.  Women typically use sanitary\nnapkins (pads) or tampons to absorb menstrual flow. Menstrual blood is almost\nalways dark color and not bright.\nPost-Childbirth bleeding\nSuch bleeding\noccurs after the event of birth or miscarriage.  It has no minimum duration,\nbut it may even last up to forty days.  Umm Salamah said:\n“During the lifetime of the\nProphet, the post-childbirth woman would seclude herself for forty days.”\n(al-Bukhari)\nA woman experiencing post-childbirth\nbleeding has to stop praying for forty days unless her bleeding stops before\nthat.  If her bleeding stops before that time, she is to perform\nghusl\n(ritual\nbath) and start praying.  If she sees blood after forty days, most scholars say\nthat she is not to stop praying. The blood of postpartum bleeding is also\nalmost always dark.\nForbidden Acts\nDivine wisdom has exempted women from\ncertain religious duties due to various reasons associated with bleeding.  The\nfollowing is a list of acts which are forbidden during menstruation and post-childbirth\nbleeding:\n(1)      Formal Prayer (\nSalah\n)\nA woman experiencing her period or\npost-childbirth bleeding is not to perform her prayers, whether obligatory or\nvoluntary, and those prayers which are missed due to this reason are not to be\nmade up at a later time.\nIf her blood flow starts after the time\nfor a certain prayer begins, for example, half an hour after the time for\nDhuhr\nprayer, then, after her bleeding ends, she should make up that\nDhuhr\nprayer,\nsince she was pure when the prayer became obligatory upon her. She should not,\nhowever, make up the prayers she missed while she is bleeding.\n[1]\nIf  there is enough time left to pray\nat least one\nrakah\n(unit of prayer) after performing the ritual bath, she\nshould pray that prayer, because the Prophet said:\n“Whoever catches with one unit of\nprayer (\nrakah\n) before the sun rises has caught the\nFajr\nprayer,\nand whoever catches with one\nrakah\nbefore the sun sets has caught the\nAsr\nprayer.” (\nSaheeh al-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nExample: if she performs the ritual\nbath after the completion of her bleeding at the time of\nAsr\nand there\nis enough time left before sunset for her to pray one\nrakah\n, then she\nshould pray\nAsr\n.\n(2)      Fasting\nIt is forbidden for a woman experiencing\nmenstruation or postpartum bleeding to fast, whether it be for\nRamadan\nor\nvoluntarily, but unlike the formal prayers she must make up the missed days of\nRamadan\n.\n(3)      Sexual intercourse\nIt is forbidden to have sexual\nintercourse while a women is menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding,\nalthough other types of intimacy are allowed.  As for anal intercourse, it is\nforbidden at all times.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, was asked “What is it permissible for me to do with my wife when she\nis menstruating?”  He said:\n“Do as you wish except for sexual\nintercourse.”\n(Muslim)\n(4)     Touching a copy of the Quran\nIt is forbidden to touch a copy of the Quran\nwhen one is in any state of impurity, because Allah says:\n“… which none can touch except the purified.”\n(Quran 56:79)\nThe Prophet told the people of Yemen:\n“No one should touch the Quran\nexcept one who is pure.” (\nMalik\n,\nan-Nasa’i\n,\nIbn Hibbaan\n,\nal-Bayhaqi\n)\nPermissible Acts\n(1)  reciting the Quran from\nmemory.\n(2)\nDu’a\n(supplication).\n(3)  engaging in\nadhkar\n: remembering\nAllah with specific words like\nSubhan-Allah\n,\nAllahu Akbar\n, and\nothers.\n(4)  reading books of hadeeth or\nany other Islamic books.\nOne should keep in mind that it is\npermissible to read and touch a translation of the Quran, as it is not the word\nof Allah but rather a"

Should I apply for\nthis\nhalal\njob or another? One shouldprays\nIstikharah\nconcerning\nthe thing he or she thinks is more likely to be better and then go ahead with\ndoing it.\nIstikharah\nis not prayed for matters that are\nconsidered obligatory acts of worship, or for staying away from sins and evil\nactions.\nIt is recommended, before praying\nIstikharah\n, to\nconsult someone whom you know is sincere, caring and has experience, and who is\ntrustworthy with regard to his or her religious commitment and knowledge.\nCommon Mistakes\n·\nBelieving that there is a set number of\ntimes to pray\nIstikharah\n.\nThere is no set time period for praying\nIstikharah\nand it is permissible to repeat it more than once.\n·\nBelieving in the need for a dream.\nSome people believe that after praying\nIstikharah\nthey should experience a dream or feeling of ease.  This is not correct.   Even\nwithout such a thing, if a person makes a decision it should be hoped, due to\nthe sincere\ndu’a\nof\nIstikharah\n, that this will be the best decision.\n·\nBelieving that the\ndu’a\nwas not\nanswered.\nIf a person does not succeed in a decision he takes\nafter praying\nIst"

In Islam,\nTaqwa refers to consciousness of Allah. It describes a state of awareness of\nAllah in everything you do.\n·\nAameen\n: An expression said at the end\nof making a supplication, meaning ‘O Allah, please accept.’\n·\nQiblah\n: The direction one faces\nduring the formal prayers.\nThe Arabic word “\ndu’a”\nmeans to ask your\nLord for His help and support. It can be translated as supplication or prayer. It\nis a\nform of worship\nbecause Allah orders us to make\ndu’a\nto Him:\n“And your Lord says, ‘Make\ndu’a\nto Me, and I will\nanswer you!’” (Quran 40:60)\nSince\ndu’a\nis an act of worship, the way it is\nmade, the procedure to be followed, and the manner to be observed when\nperforming this worship must be from the Quran and\nSunnah\n.\nDu’a\nis closely related to one’s faith. One, it\nis an open declaration that you believe in Allah and Allah alone. Two, it makes\nyou feel that you are not in control of your life, Allah is. This is why you\nare going to Him and begging Him for your needs. Three, it reminds you that Allah\ntruly hears your\ndu’a\nand will respond to it.\nSince\ndu’a\nis an act of worship, making\ndu’a\nto someone other than Allah is an act of\nShirk\n.\nDu’a\ncan only be\ndirected to Allah and Allah alone. One verse from the Quran is sufficient to\nillustrate this point:\n“Say (O Muhammad), ‘I make\ndu’a\nonly to my Lord\n(Allah), and I associate none as partners along with Him.’” (Quran 72:20)\nSuppose a person makes\ndu’a\nto other than Allah,\nbe it an idol or a saint, while believing that that being can hear him like\nAllah, and can answer his\ndu’a\n, then doing so is equating that object or\nperson with Allah.

Is there any other god besides Allah? Little is that\nyou remember!” (Quran 27:62)\n2.Be sincere towards Allah when making\ndu’a\n“And those who you make\ndu’a\nto (ask) besides Him can\nneither come to your aid nor can they help themselves.” (Quran 7:197)\n3.Don’t be hasty when making\ndu’a\nThe Prophet said, “\nThe slave will receive\na response so long as his\ndu’a\ndoes not involve sin or severing of\nfamily ties, and so long as he is not hasty.” It was said, “What does being\nhasty mean?” He said: “When he says, ‘I made\ndu’a\nand I made\ndu’a\n,\nand I have not seen any response,’ and he gets frustrated and stops making\ndu’a\n.”\n[1]\n4.Make\ndu’a\nfor good things\nAllah likes His slaves to ask Him for\neverything that is in their spiritual and worldly benefit such as food, drink,\nclothing, guidance and forgiveness etc. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“Let\none of you ask his Lord for what he needs, even asking Him for the lace of his\nshoe if it breaks.”\n[2]\n5.Make\ndu’a\nwith an attentive heart\nConcentrate on making\ndu’a\n,\nfocus on what you are asking Allah, put your mind and heart into it.

It\nis similar to the\nAdhan\nand is said right before the prayer starts.\n·\nDhul-Hijjah\n- The twelfth month of\nthe Islamic calendar. It is the month in which the obligatory pilgrimage is performed.\n·\nRamadan\n- The ninth month of the\nIslamic lunar calendar.  It is the month in which the obligatory fasting has\nbeen prescribed.\nThings to Avoid While Making\nDu’a\n1.Don’t go beyond limits\nWhat it means is asking Allah for things He has\nforbidden. For example, while it is fine to pray to Allah to marry someone, it\nis forbidden to ask Allah to give you a girl friend or a boy friend, or to win\na lottery.\n2.Not expecting an answer\nA Muslim should hope that Allah will answer His\ndu’a\nas Allah is Merciful to His slaves and powerful to grant them their wishes.\n3.To ask for things of this world only in\ndu’a\nThink about it, what is greater, this world or the\nhereafter? For a true believer, it is obvious that what Allah has prepared in\nthe life to come is greater. Therefore, a Muslim who understands this point\nwill ask Allah for the blessings of the Hereafter as well.\n4.To address Allah with improper Names\nRemember this simple rule: do not address Allah or use\nany Name of Allah that is not from the Quran or\nSunnah\n. Addressing Allah\nwith words like “Big Guy.”\n5.Do not make\ndu’a\nagainst yourself or your family and do\nnot curse others.\nA point to remember, as a person may pray against a\nfamily member or even himself in a fit of rage and start cursing.\n6.Do not pray for your death\nYour life is Allah’s gift to you, do not ask Allah to\ntake it away!\nPreferred Times When\nDu’a\nIs Likely to Be Accepted\nDu’a\ncan be made at any time, but it is more\nlikely to be accepted at the following times:\n1.\nDu’a\nin the last third of the night\nAllah informs us in the Quran describing the believers,\n“and they seek forgiveness from their Lord in the hours of the\ndawn.” (Quran 51:18)\nHow do you calculate the last third of the night? The\nnight extends from the time of sunset till the time for Fajr begins. For\nexample, say sunset is at 5pm and Fajr for next day starts at 5am. The night is\n12 hrs. A third of a night is 4 hrs. The last third of the night will be from\n1am-5am.\n2.\nDu’a\nwhen\nAdhan\nis called\nThe Prophet said, “\nWhen the\nAdhan\nis called,\nthe doors of the skies are opened, and the\ndu’a\nis answered.\n” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\n3.\nDu’a\nBetween\nAdhan\n&\nIqama\nThis is one of the best times for the prayer to be\naccepted that is given to a believer to ask from Allah for his needs of this\nworld and the Hereafter.\n4.\nDu’a\nwhile prostrating (kowtowing)\nThis is the best posture that a worshipper can be in\nbecause it is the height of humility. Allah loves this posture the most. The\nProphet, may Allah praise him, said: “\nThe closest that a person is to his\nLord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of\ndu’a\nthen.\n” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\n5.\nDu’a\nbefore the conclusion of formal prayer\nBefore concluding the formal prayers, by saying\n‘As-Salamu\n‘Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah’\na person can make any\ndu’a\nthat he likes at\nthis time as it is one of the times when prayers are responded to.\n6.\nDu’a\nafter the obligatory formal prayer\nWhen asked which\ndu’a\nis most likely to be\nresponded to, the Prophet said, “\nIn the last part of the night and after the\nobligatory prayers.\n” (\nTirmidhi\n)\n7.An hour on Friday\nProphet Muhammad said: “\nOn Friday there is an hour\nwhen, if a Muslims happens to pray at that time and ask Allah for something\ngood, He will give it to him\n” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\n8.\nDu’a\nin Ramadan, the month of fasting\nProphet Muhammad said: “\nWhen Ramadan comes, the doors\nof mercy are opened and the doors of Hell are closed, and the devils are locked\nup.\n” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\n9.First ten days of the Islamic month of Hajj (\nDhul-Hijjah\n)\nThe Islamic month in which the annual pilgrimage, or\nHajj, is performed, is a blessed month. The Prophet said about the first ten\ndays of this month,\n“There are no days during which good deeds are more\nbeloved to Allah than during these ten days.”\n(\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\n10.During rainfall\nThe Prophet said,\n“Two are the\ndu’as\nthat are\nnever returned: the\ndu’a\nmade when the\nAdhan\nis called and at the\ntime of rainfall.”\n(\nAbu Daud\n)"

Like socks, you may not wipe\nover the shoes if you remove them after having broken your\nwudoo\n,\nrather, in this case, you will have to make\nmasah\nover the socks\nunderneath them.\nMaking up Missed Prayers\nMaking up prayers missed intentionally or\nunintentionally is called\nqada’\nin Arabic.  We will only discuss making\nup the\nsalah\nif you missed it unintentionally.  A person who misses a\nsalah\nis responsible for performing it no matter how late he remembers it.  The\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“If anyone misses a\nsalah\n, he must pray it\nwhen he remembers it.  There is no expiation except the\nsalah\nitself.”\n[1]\nFor example, if you remember at the time of\nAsr\nthat you have missed\nDhuhr\n, you should make up\nDhuhr\nand then\npray\nAsr\n.\nMethod\nIf you sleep through a\nsalah\n, meaning the time\nfor that prayer has passed and you have slept through it, you must make\nwudoo\nupon waking up and offer it.  One night, during a journey with the Prophet,\nsome people said, ‘If only the Prophet would take rest with us during the last\nhours of the night.’  He replied,\n‘I am afraid you will sleep and miss the\nFajr\nsalah\n.’\nBilal said, ‘I will wake you up.’  They all went to sleep, but\nBilal also fell asleep!  The Prophet woke up when the sun began to rise and\nsaid,\n‘O Bilal, what happened to your statement?’\nHe replied, ‘I have\nnever slept so much!’  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, said,\n‘Allah took our souls when He wished and released them when\nHe wished.  O Bilal, get up and call the\nAdhan\nfor prayer.’\nThe\nProphet then made\nwudoo\nand when the sun came up completely, he stood up\nand prayed.\n[2]\nPrayer of the Traveler\nIslamic law makes the\nsalah\neasier for a traveler\nin two ways:\nBy shortening prayers: the four\nrakah\nsalah\nis shortened to two\nrakahs\n.\nBy combining prayers:\nDhuhr\ncan be combined with\nAsr\n,\nMaghrib\ncan be combined with\nIsha\n.  Prayers, however, cannot be\ncombined in any other way.\nFajr\ncannot be combined with\nIsha\n,\nFajr\ncannot be combined with\nDhuhr\n.\nAsr\ncan not be combined with\nMaghrib\n.\nConditions\nPrayers can be shortened when one is traveling.  You cannot\nshorten the prayers unless you have actually left your city limits.  There is\nno time limit as to how long you can shorten the prayers.  The majority of\nscholars allow it for up to four days and nights, though.  In case of bad weather,\nprayers can be co"

month of the\nIslamic lunar calendar.  It is the month in which the obligatory fasting has\nbeen prescribed.\n·\nShariah\n- Islamic Law.\n·\nNisaab\n- the minimum amount of wealth\na person must possess for\nzakah\nto become obligatory.\nThe five most important and essential acts of worship in Islam\nare simply known as the “pillars of Islam.”  They are the “\nshahadah\n”\n(the testimony that no one deserves worship except Allah and Muhammad is the\nMessenger of Allah), the five daily prayers,\nzakah\n, fasting, and the\nhajj\npilgrimage.  A Muslim has to first and foremost focus on learning and\npracticing these pillars before focusing on other aspects of Islam.\nThe word ‘\nzakah\n’ is usually translated as ‘poor\ndue’ or ‘alms tax.’  Actually, no single word can translate\nzakah\nproperly.\nBefore the word\nzakah\nis explained, it is best\nunderstood with another word, “\nsadaqah\n.”\nZakah\nand\nsadaqah\nare different.\nZakah\nis obligatory charity and is required, whereas\nsadaqah\nis voluntary\ncharity and is a recommended act that brings extra reward.  Moreover,\nzakah\nis the third pillar of Islam.  Not paying\nzakah\nout of negligence is a\nsin, whereas a person is generally not sinful for not paying voluntary charity. \nThat is why it is called “voluntary” charity!\nZakah\nis calculated\nprecisely and can only be given to specific recipients, whereas\nsadaqah\nis not bound by such regulations.\nZakah\nhas to be given yearly, whereas\nsadaqah\ncan be given only once or as frequently as one likes.\nSpirituality of\nZakah\nZakah\nis a beautiful act of worship that is\nintimately tied to purification.  As a matter of fact, spending one’s wealth in\nzakah\npurifies the heart from the love of material wealth.  A person who\noffers the gift of his wealth affirms the truth that to him nothing is dearer\nthan the love of Allah and he is prepared to sacrifice even his wealth to\nplease Allah.  The Prophet Muhammad said,\n‘Whoever pays the\nzakah\non his wealth will\nhave its evil removed from him.’\n[1]\nExact Definition of\nZakah\nIn Islamic Law (\nShariah\n), words are clearly\ndefined.\nZakah\nis no exception.\nShariah\ndefines\nzakah\nto\nbe specific portion of one’s wealth that one must give yearly to a specific\ngroup of recipients that are mentioned in the Quran.\nImportance of\nZakah\n& the Punishment for Not\nPaying It\nZakah\nrepresents the compassion of Islam towards\nthe poor and needy.\nZakah\nis not a tax, but it is an act of worship for\nwhich one receives reward from Allah.  Not paying the\nzakah\nis a sin.  Denying\nits obligation is an act of disbelief.\nThe Quran tells us about the fate of those who refuse to\npay\nzakah\n.  It says,\n“…And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it\nin the way of Allah, warn them of a painful suffering (in the life to come).  On\nthat day when (the hoarded wealth) will be heated in the fire of Hell and with\nit their foreheads, their sides, and their backs will be branded (and it will\nbe said to them), ‘This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves, so\ntaste what you used to hoard.’” (Quran 9:34-35)\nWhat is\nNisaab\n?\nZakah\nis not to be paid unless the wealth reaches\na minimum level called “\nnisaab\n.” Think of\nnisaab\nas a scale to\nhelp you determine if you are required to pay\nzakah\n.  Different forms of\nwealth have different\nnisaab\n:\nSilver 595gm\nGold 85gm,\n3 US oz, or 2.74 troy oz of pure gold\nCash\n& Savings      Equal to the value of 85 gm of gold or 595 gm of silver, whichever\nworks out to be less.\nZakah\non above items is 2.5% of their value.  If\nthe\nnisaab\nis met in any one form of wealth,\nzakah\nbecomes\napplicable only on that particular form of wealth and is calculated on the\ntotal (\nnisaab\nplus excess) of that.\nThe prices of gold and silver vary everyday in\ninternational markets.  For example, on August 15, 2012 the price of gold was approximately\n$51.54/gm and for silver was $0.89/gm, hence the\nnisaab\nfor gold was\napproximately $4380.9 ($51.54 x 85 grams) and the\nnisaab\nfor silver was\napproximately $529.55 ($0.89 x 595 grams).  Gold and silver prices can be\nobtained from www.goldprice.org\nWhen is\nZakah\nDue?\nMany Islamic rules and regulations depend on the Islamic\nlunar year.\nZakah\nis one of them.  If you have had wealth more than the\nnisaab\nfor one (lunar) year, then you just pay the\nzakah\n.  Though\nnot\nrequired, but most people calculate their\nzakah\nRamadan to\nRamadan.  You can fix to calculate and pay your\nzakah\nevery 1\nst\nor 15\nth\nof Ramadan.\nExample: Say you have $2000/- and 800 grams of gold f"

401(k), Keogh,\nIRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, etc.  - as zakatable at the rate of 2.5% annually.  Usually\nnot all the money is accessible to the investor for withdrawal, up to 50%\nnormally being allowed.  Therefore, the following formula is suggested by some\nscholars:\nWithdrawal Amount - Prescribed Penalty - Prescribed\nTax = Zakatable Amount\nWho Can Receive\nZakah\n?\nThe Quran tells us who is entitled to receive\nzakah\n. \nThe eight categories are found in the Quran in Chapter at-Tawbah, 9:60:\n1.  The Poor\nPoor people who do not have sufficient money to meet\ntheir needs are qualified to receive\nzakah\n.  It does not mean they are\npenniless, but cannot make their ends meet, yet they do not ask others for help\nout of modesty and a sense of self-respect.\n2.  The Destitute\nThese are people who are so poor that they have nothing\nto meet their needs.  Obviously, they are in worse condition than the first\ncategory.\n3.\nZakah\nAdministrators\nPeople responsible for collecting and distributing\nzakah\ncould be paid for their work from\nzakah\nfunds.  They can receive wages\nwhether they are poor or not.\n4.  Reconcile Hearts\nPeople who have recently accepted Islam can be given\nzakah\n. \nPeople can also be given money from\nzakah\nto seek their support or to\nprevent their opposition.\n5.  Freeing Slaves\nIn the past,\nzakah\nmoney was also used to buy\nslaves their freedom.  The Quran has legislated it to be one of the legitimate ways\nto spend the money from\nzakah\n.  It is a clear expression of the\ncompassion of Islam towards treatment of slaves when they existed.  Islam\nraised freeing slaves to an act of worship pleasing to God.  No other religion\nhas ever done that as far as this author is aware of.\n6.  Paying Debts\nPeople who are overburdened with debt and do not have a\nway to pay on their own can also receive\nzakah\nfunds.  The debt can be\ndue to medical reasons, marriage, or other lawful expenses.\n7.  Cause of Allah\nWealth can also be spent in the cause of Allah.  The\ntraditional understanding held by the classical scholars of Islam is that this\ncategory is reserved for jihad or a legitimate war.  Later scholars have\nincluded efforts for the spread and ideological defense of Islam in this\ncategory as well.\n8.  Travelers\nPeople used to get stranded in the past while traveling\nwith no access to their funds back home.  It happens sometimes today as well.  In\nsuch situations, those travelers may be given money from\nzakah\n.  The\ncondition is that their journey should not be in disobedience of Allah, but for\nan acceptable cause like seeking knowledge, looking for a job, or doing\nbusiness.\nWho Can Not Receive\nZakah\n?\nA wealthy person cannot give\nzakah\nto his or her\nparents because they are the child’s responsibility.  Also, a husband cannot\ngive\nzakah\nto his wife as she is his financial responsibility.  Furthermore,\na non-Muslim cannot be given\nzakah\naccording to the majority of scholars. \nPoor non-Muslims can be helped with\nsadaqah\nor voluntary charity.\nPractical Tips on Giving\nZakah\n1.    You can give money to a poor and needy\nMuslims directly if you know them.\n2.    Your local Islamic center most likely\ncollects\nzakah\nand distributes it to the needy of the local community or\nworks with a charitable organization.  Therefore, you can always ask the local\nmosque if they accept\nzakah\n.  You might even find boxes labeled “\nzakah\n”\nin the mosque in which you can simply drop your check or cash for\nzakah\n.\n3.    Furthermore, you can search online and find\nnumerous Islamic charitable organization that collect\nzakah\nto sponsor\norphans or distribute food or medicine in disaster-struck areas.\nThe following are just some of the organizations you can\ngive your\nzakah\nto:\nwww.zakat.org\nwww.islamic-relief.com\nwww.hhrd.org\nMiscellaneous Issues\nZakah\nis to be paid on gold and silver jewelry.  The\nzakah\non the gold will be calculated according to the gold content in\nthe jewelry (i.e.  karats) and its value in the market.  Hence when calculating\nthe value of your gold, you must consult a jeweler for the correct value (based\non the content and weight).  Any stones in the jewelry are not subject to\nzakah\n.\nYou must have the intention to pay\nzakah\nwhen you\ngive it out.  In other words,"

The Prophet informed us,\n“Fasting the day of\nAshura\nis an expiation\nfor the past year.”\n[3]\n4.       Fasting Mondays and Thursdays\nAbu Hurairah, the close companion of Prophet Muhammad,\nreported that the Prophet would fast on Mondays and Thursdays.  When asked\nabout that, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsaid:\n“The actions are presented on every Monday and Thursday.  Allah\nforgives every Muslim or every believer, except for those who are boycotting\neach other.  He says (about them): ‘Leave them.’”\n[4]\nWhen the Prophet\nwas asked about fasting on Mondays, he said\n: “That is the day on which I\nwas born and the day on which I received revelation.”\n[5]\n5.       Fasting most of the month of Sha’ban (8\nth\nIslamic month)\nSha’ban\nis the name of the Islamic month that\ncomes before\nRamadan\n.  The Prophet would fast most of the month of\nSha’ban\n.\n‘Aisha, the wife\nof the Prophet, said:\n“I never saw the Messenger of Allah fast a\ncomplete month except for\nRamadan\n, and I have never seen him fast more\nin a month than he did in\nSha’ban\n.”\n[6]\nDifferences Between Fasts of\nRamadan\n& Voluntary\nFasts\n1.    The intention for a voluntary fast can be\nmade during the day\nLet us say that you woke up and prayed\nFajr\n.  You\ndid not have the intention to fast that day and you also did not eat, drink,\nhave intercourse, or o"

It has been practiced for centuries in connection with religious\nceremonies by Christians, Jews, Confucians, Hindus, Taoists, Jains, and others\nas Allah says:\n“O you who believe, fasting is\nprescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may\nbecome righteous.” (Quran 2:183)\nBut like other rituals fasting\nwas also altered and corrupted.\nFasting in Primitive Societies\nFasting was made part of the\nfertility rites in primitive ceremonies which were held at the vernal and\nautumnal equinoxes and survived for centuries.  Some primitive societies fasted\nto avert catastrophe or to serve as penance for sin.  Native North Americans\nheld tribal fasts to avert threatening disasters.  The Native Americans of\nMexico and the Incas of Peru observed penitential fasts to appease their gods. Past\nnations of the Old World, such as the Assyrians and the Babylonians, observed\nfasting as a form of penance.\nFasting in Judaism and Christianity\nJews observe fasting as a form\nof penitence and purification annually on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur,\nwhich corresponds to the tenth of Muharram (\n‘Ashura\n) of the Islamic\ncalendar.  On this day neither food nor drink is permitted.\nEarly Christians associated\nfasting with penitence and purification. During the first two centuries of its\nexistence, the Christian Church established fasting as a voluntary preparation\nfor receiving the sacraments of Holy Communion and baptism and for the\nordination of priests. Later, these fasts were made obligatory, as other days\nwere subsequently added.  In the 6th century the Lenten fast was expanded to 40\ndays, on each of which only one meal was permitted.  After the Reformation,\nfasting was retained by most Protestant Churches and was made optional in some\ncases. Stricter Protestants like the Puritans, however, condemned not only the\nfestivals of the Church, but its traditional fasts as well.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, fasting\nmay involve partial abstinence from food and drink or total abstinence.  The Roman\nCatholic days of fasting are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.\nIn the United\n  States, fasting is observed mostly by Episcopalians and Lutherans among\nProtestants, by Orthodox and Conservative Jews, and by Roman Catholics.\nSecular Fasting: The Hunger Strike\nFrom being an empty ritual,\nfasting went to another extreme in the West: the hunger strike, a form of\nfasting, which in modern times has become a political weapon after being\npopularized by Mohandas Gandhi, leader of Indian struggle for freedom, who\nundertook fasts to compel his followers to obey his precept of nonviolence.\nFasting in Islam\nIslam has prescribed and\nretained the ritual of fasting throughout centuries as a means for purifying\nthe soul of a man in order to draw near to his Creator by selfish motives and base\ndesires of self.  It has a special status among all the devotional worships\nbecause it is difficult to perform.  It puts a bridle on the most uncontrolled,\nsavage human emotions.  The most unruly human emotions are pride, avarice,\ngluttony, lust, envy, and anger.  These emotions, by their nature are not easy\nto control, thus a person must strive hard to discipline them.  Fasting helps\ndo that.\nThe Islamic calendar consists\nof twelve lunar months. Muslims measure their year by the cycles of the moon\nrather than the sun, so the Muslim lunar year is eleven days shorter than the\nChristian solar year. Muslims are forbidden to adjust their year by adding an\nextra month, as the Jews do to keep their lunar calendar in synch with the\nseasons.  Hence, the months of the Muslim year do not relate to the seasons. \nEach month lasts 29 or 30 days and occurs during different seasons of the\nyear.  A new month begins when the evening new moon is sighted.  The ninth\nmonth is called\nRamadan\nand is dedicated to fasting.  It is pronounced\nRamazan\nby Indo-Pakistanis.\nBelow we list the virtues and\nrewards of this month and fasting in general.  In the next lesson we will learn\nhow to fast.  In the third and final installment, we will discuss the social\naspects of\nRamadan\n.  In the fourth and last lesson, we will learn about\nthe end of month activities.\nVirtues of the Month of\nRamadan\nTo motivate us and to prepare\nours"

If I don’t, I won’t incur any sin,\nbut I will get extra reward for keeping them.  In this lesson we will focus\nonly on the most important obligatory fasts that are kept in the month of\nRamadan\n.\nFasting In\nRamadan\nFasting in\nRamadan\nis one of the five\npillars of Islam as the Prophet said:\n“Islam is built on five pillars: testifying\nthat there is no true god except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, the\nestablishment of the prayer, the giving of\nzakah\n, the fast of\nRamadan\n,\nand the pilgrimage to Mecca.” (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nFasting in\nRamadan\nis an obligation on every\nMuslim who has reached the age of puberty.  Allah said in the Quran:\n“So whoever witnesses the month should fast it.” (Quran\n2:185)\nWhoever does not fast\nduring\nRamadan\nwithout a legitimate excuse commits what is considered\na major sin.\nWho is Exempt from Fasting?\n(1)  A Muslim child who has\nnot yet\nreached puberty\nis exempt from fasting till\none\nof the following\nsigns of puberty appear:\n(a) discharge of semen, whether by\nexperiencing a wet dream or otherwise\n(b) growth of pubic hair\n(c) menstruation\n(d) a person has turned 15\n(2)  If you are\ntraveling\nin\nRamadan\n,\nyou have the option not to fast. If you choose not to, you must make up for the\ndays missed at a later time before the following\nRamadan\n.\n(3)  A woman is not allowed to fast during\nmenstruation or post-natal bleeding, and she must perform the number of fasts\nshe missed on other days before the following\nRamadan\n.\n(4)  A\npregnant\nor\nbreast-feeding\nwoman may be exempted from fasting if it proves harmful to her or the infant.  This\ncase is discussed in more detail below.\n(5)  The\nmentally insane\nare also\nexempt from fasting.\n(6)  The Merciful Lord does not burden a\nsoul beyond its ability.  If you are\nsick\n, you are also exempt from\nfasting.\nThere are two issues to know here:\nFirst, how sick is sick?  Cough or minor\nheadache is not serious enough not to fast, but if there is medical reason, and\nyou know from experience, or are certain that fasting will make your illness\nworse or delay recovery, you do not need to fast.\nSecond, you should make up the days when\nyou get better.\nThe chronically ill who do not foresee any chance\nof recovery must feed a poor person for every day of\nRamadan\nthey miss.\nThey do not need to fast for them on other days.\n(8)  Those\ntoo old\nto fast are also\nexempt from fasting, and they too must feed a poor person for every day of\nRamadan\nthey miss.\nHow Do I Fast in\nRamadan\n?\nFirst, check with your local mosque for the beginning\nof\nRamadan\nby calling or visiting them.  Usually, mosques print a\nspecial schedule for\nRamadan\nthat will tell you the times for starting\nand ending the fast (the time of\nFajr\nand\nMaghrib\n, respectively) and\nmaybe even the time for the\nTaraweeh\nprayer.\nSecond, intend in your heart the night before\nthat you will fast the next day based on what the Prophet, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“There is no fast for the person who did\nnot intend to fast from the night before.” (\nAn-Nasa’i\n)\nThe idea is to remind yourself that one is\nfasting for the pleasure of our Creator.\nMonth:\n9/1426,\n10-11/\n2005\nC.E\nLocation:\nSeattle, WA, USA\nCalculation Method:\nISNA\nJuristic Method:\nStandard\nDay\nRamadan\nGregorian\nFajr\nSunrise\nDhuhr\nAsr\nMaghrib\nIsha\nTue\n1\n4/10\n5:50\n7:12\n12:58\n4:05\n6:43\n8:07\nWed\n2\n5/10\n5:52\n7:14\n12:58\n4:04\n6:41\n8:05\nThu\n3\n6/10\n5:53\n7:15\n12:58\n4:02\n6:39\n8:03\nFri\n4\n7/10\n5:54\n7:17\n12:58\n4:01\n6:37\n8:01\nSat\n5\n8/10\n5:56\n7:18\n12:57\n3:59\n6:35\n7:59\nSun\n6\n9/10\n5:57\n7:20\n12:57\n3:58\n6:33\n7:57\nMon\n7\n10/10\n5:59\n7:21\n12:57\n3:56\n6:31\n7:55\nFigure 1 Specimen\nRamadan\nSchedule for\nSeattle residents prepared using\nwww.islamicfinder.org\n. \nFor example, on Tuesday, the first day of\nRamadan\n, take your pre-d"

Elaborate\ndishes are prepared, new clothes are worn, presents are exchanged, and children\nhave fun.\nThe following are some recommended acts to be\nperformed on\nEid\n:\na)\nGhusl\nor bathing early in the day before the\nEid\nprayer.\nb)Beautifying\noneself: The Prophet used to wear his best clothes to go to the\nEid\nprayer. \nHe had a cloak that he wore specifically on the two\nEids\nand Friday.\nc)Saying\ntakbeer\n(proclamation of the greatness of Allah) is\na distinctive feature of\nEid\nand is mentioned in the Quran:\n…And that you should exclaim Allah's greatness\nfor having guided you, so that you may be grateful. (Quran 2:185)\nWhen?\nThe time for\nEid\ntakbeer's\nstarts\nfrom the time a person leaves his house heading towards the prayer-hall.  The\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, would leave his\nhouse on the day of\nEid\nsaying\ntakbeer\nuntil he had performed the\nprayer.  He would stop saying the\ntakbeer\nafter the prayer.\nWhat to Say?\nThere are various authentic narrations about\nwhat should be said in the\ntakbeer\n. For brevity, we will mention the one\nwhich is most common.\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akar, La ilaha ill-Allah,\nw’Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, wa lillahil-Hamd.\n[2]\nThe\nEid\nPrayer\nIslam teaches us how to celebrate these\noccasions of joy."

The\nlast ten nights of\nRamadan\nare particularly special. Prophet Muhammad\nwould use these nights to exert himself in worship and generosity. The first of\nthese nights occurs on the eve of the 21st day of\nRamadan\n. In other\nwords, it is the night that commences after the completion of the 20th day of\nfasting.\nProphet Muhammad strove to do acts of worship during the\nlast ten days of\nRamadan\nmore than he would at any other time.\n[1]\nSince as\nMuslims we strive to be like Prophet Muhammad in as many ways as possible this\nis a time to ask ourselves what we can do to take full advantage of the special\nnights ahead.\nAttend the Taraweeh\nOne of the most beautiful and special parts of\nRamadan\nis the opportunity to attend\ntaraweeh\nprayers. They are offered throughout\nthe month. It makes a person feel as if they are part of the thriving community\nof Muslims and it is a chance to really concentrate on the recitation of the Quran\nand the words of Allah. If you have not been attending\ntaraweeh\nor have\nnot really put your heart and soul into praying these prayers then the last ten\nnights of\nRamadan\nare an opportunity for you to increase your worship.\nWhile most mosques offer\ntaraweeh\nprayers after\nIsha\nprayer, you\nwill find that some also offer you the opportunity to pray more voluntary\nprayers in congregation later in the night. If you are able to attend these\nextra prayers offered usually after midnight but before the dawn prayer, you\nwill find many benefits, including the special closeness to Allah that can only\nbe experienced in the last part of the night. “Our Lord descends each night in\nthe final third of the night, and He says: ‘Who is saying a prayer to Me that I\nmay answer it? Who is asking something of Me that I may give it him? Who is\nasking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?’”\n[2]\nA believer can also use the time between prayers to make\nlonger heartfelt\ndua\n. Prophet Muhammad said, “Whoever prayed at night in\nit (the month of\nRamadan\n) out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward\nfrom Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.”\n[3]\nSearch for\nLaylat al-Qadr\nThe rewards and blessings associated with this night are\nmany. There are many references to\nLaylat al-Qadr\nin the traditions of\nProphet Muhammad. Some of these indicate that\nLaylat al-Qadr\nfalls on\none of the last ten nights of\nRamadan\n, others point to it being an odd\nnumbered night in the last ten nights. Muslims are told in the Quran that\npraying throughout this one night is better than a thousand months of prayer.\nFor this reason alone it would be wise for a person to seek out this blessed,\nholy night by taking worship in these last nights very seriously.\nGod says in the Quran,\n“Verily! We have sent it (this\nQuran) down in the Night of Decree. And what will make you know what the Night\nof Decree is? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. Therein\ndescend the angels and the Rooh (Gabriel) by Allah’s Permission with all\nDecrees. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.” (Quran 97:1-5)\nPractice\nItikaf\nAisha, the beloved wife of Prophet Muhammad reported\nthat he (Prophet Muhammad) used to practice\nItikaf\nin the last ten\nnights of\nRamadan\nand said, “Look for\nLaylat\nal-Qadr\nin the last ten nights of the month of\nRamadan\n”\n[4]\nItikaf\nis a type of retreat when a person does not leave the mosque and\nthe remembrance of God except when it is absolutely necessary such as going to\nthe bathroom.\nRenowned Islamic scholar Ibnul Qayyim described the\ngreater goal of\nitikaf\n.  “His (a person in\nItikaf\n) thoughts are\nall of remembrance of God, and thinking of how to attain His Pleasure and what\nwill cause nearness to Him. This leads him to feel contented with God instead\nof the people, so that prepares him for being at peace with Him alone on the\nday of loneliness in the grave, when there is no one else to give comfort, nor\nanyone to grant solace except Him.”\nMake Extra\nDua\nRamadan\nis a time of quiet reflection and a\nperfect opportunity to make  extra\ndua\n. This is especially true for the\nlast ten nights and we should take the opportunity to make long and heartfelt\ndua\nto Allah. Aisha always made an effort to maximise her worship. In order to do\nthis she asked Prophet Muhammad what she should say when making dua in t"

Fasting is prescribed for you as it was\nprescribed for those before you that you may gain self-restraint.”(Quran 2:183)\nFasting is an act of spiritual purification; it is an\nimportant act of worship that was legislated in order to bring a person closer\nto Allah and allow him or her to experience the benefits associated with piety. \nThroughout the day every time a person conquers his need to eat or drink he\nremembers Allah.  Abstaining from food and drink is only one dimension of\nfasting.\nAbstaining from sinful behaviours is another dimension\nthat is often overlooked.  Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of\nAllah be upon him, said that some people gain nothing from their\nsawm\nexcept hunger and thirst.\n[1]\nIn another\nhadith\nhe said that if a person does not give up false words and actions, Allah has no\nneed of him giving up food and drink.\n[2]\nFasting purifies the\nmind and helps a person gain control over his ego and base desires as well as teaches\na person how to modify his behaviour and change bad habits into good ones.\nSawm\nalso teaches compassion and empathy for those who go without food or water on a\ndaily basis.  Patience, gratitude and humility are all qualities that Muslims\nstrive to perfect and fasting is one way that help inculcate them in our daily\nlives.\nFasting is a very special act of worship because it is\nsomething that is between the fasting person and God.  God says in a\nhadith\nqudsi,\n“Fasting is for Me and I alone will reward it”.\n[3]\nThe\ndu’a\nof the fasting person will not be\nrefused.\n[4]\nThus making lots of\ndu’a\nwhen fasting and at the breaking of your fast is highly recommended.  At the\nbreaking of fast Allah chooses people to save from the fires of Hell.\n[5]\nThe end of the fast is also one of the two joyful moments associated with\nfasting.  The other is when a person meets his Lord and celebrates his\nsuccessful fasting.\n[6]\nFasting is also a strong\nfortress that keeps a person safe from the fires of Hell\n[7]\nand in addition to this, on the Day of Judgment the fasting itself will\nintercede for a person.\n[8]\nCharity (\nZakah\n)\n“Truly, those who believe, do good deeds, establish\nsalah\nand pay\nzakah\nwill have their reward with their Lord; no fear shall come\nupon them, nor will they grieve.” (Quran 2:277)\nThe word\nzakah\nis mentioned approximately 30\ntimes in the Quran and it is coupled with\nsalah\nfor almost all of them. \nIt is a great act of worship that, like fasting, offers the chance for\nspiritual purification.  In the case of\nzakah\nhowever it purifies the\nheart of both the giver and the recipient and it detaches a person from the\ngreed and stinginess often associated with wealth.  A person who diligently\npays his\nzakah\nfeels closeness to Allah and a responsibility for the\npoor and needy.  To receive\nzakah\nis also a right given by Allah.  The\nperson who receives\nzakah\nfinds his heart purified from the envy and\nhatred that the poor often have for the rich and powerful.  Thus it strengthens\nthe ties of brotherhood.\nThe word\nzakah\nliterally means that which\npurifies and it was legislated by Allah for a number of reasons.  It"

We view\nJihad\nto be among the best of deeds; shall we not then perform\nJihad\n?” He said\nto her: “\nThe best\nJihad\n(for you)\nis a\nHajj\nthat is\naccepted.”\n[3]\n3.This act of worship requires that a person dedicates all of his God-given\nfaculties to perfect it! God has promised those who perfect this act of worship\na great reward; the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsaid:\nThe accepted\nHajj\n(\nHajj Mabroor\n) has no reward except\nJannah\n(Heavenly Abode).\n[4]\n4.The Prophet was asked: “What is the best deed in the sight of\nGod?” He answered:\n“Belief in Allah!”\nHe was then asked,\n“What is\nnext?”\nHe answered:\n“\nJihad\nin the path of Allah.”\nHe was then\nasked,\n“What is next?” He said: “An accepted\nHajj\n!”\n[5]\n5.The Prophet said: “O Amr’ do you not know that\nHajj\neffaces all sins done before it?”\n[6]\n6.The Prophet said: The one who performs\nHajj\nand does not\nengage in sexual activities with his wife during\nHajj\nand does not give\ninto evil behavior (during\nHajj\n) will return from that\nHajj\nas\nthe day he was born (i.e.  sin free).\n[7]\n7.The Prophet said: “As the camel of a person coming for\nHajj\nraises and lowers its feet as it walks towards Mecca for the pilgrimage, the\nperson who has intended the\nHajj\nreceives a reward for each footstep and\na sin would be removed with each footstep and he would be elevated a rank.”\n[8]\n8.The Prophet also said: “The one performing\nHajj\nis the guest\nof Allah; He called upon them to perform this duty and they answered that call!\nThey shall ask of Him and He will respond to them.”\nConditions of\nHajj\nScholars categorize the conditions for the obligation of\nHajj\ninto various sub-categories, but in general all are agreed that the\nrelevant conditions that are applicable today include:\n1.Being a Muslim.\n2.Intellectual sanity and rational capacity .\n3.Reaching the age of puberty.\n4.Capability (financial and physical).\nThe first condition of ‘faith’ is a pre-requisite in all\nacts o"

It is called by this name, because the pilgrims would get\nready for this long day and night by feeding their animals and making sure\ntheir camels had enough water for the long journey ahead.  They would also stock\nup on water in anticipation of the long stand on the day of Arafah, which was\nusually a hot, long day!\nWhen the day of\nTarwiyah\ncomes, one should enter\nIhram\nin the morning from the place where he is in Mecca.  The Prophet, may the\nmercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, donned the garments of\nIhram\nat the\nDuha\ntime (the time just after sunrise till just before the sun\nreaches its zenith).  He should then say the following:\nLab’baika Haj’jan\n(Here I am O Allah performing the\nHajj\n) which indicates one’s\nintention of performing the\nHajj\n.  After that one should say the\nTalbiyah\ncontinuously:\n‘Lab’baik Al’laahum’ma Lab’baik, Lab’baika laa Shareeka\nlaka Lab’baik, In’nal Hamda wan Ni’mata laka wal Mulk, Laa Shareeka lak’.\n[1]\nYou would then proceed with your\nHajj\ngroup to\nthe area of Mina, which literally is a tent city.  Millions of people gather\nhere on this day from all corners of the globe.  It is wise that you carefully\nnote the area that you are in; each is marked with a color and an\nidentification code.  If this fails, then you can simply ask for the general\nlocation of the tents of your country.\nIt is important for one to try their best to be in Mina\nbefore the sun reaches its zenith.  The pilgrim should busy himself with the\nremembrance of Allah and recite the Quran.  One should avoid idle talk and discussion\nof worldly matters and argumentation.\nAbu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him said: “\nI\nheard the Prophet say, ‘Whoever performs\nHajj\nand does not commit any\nrafath\n(obscenity) or\nfusooq\n(transgression), he returns (free from sin) as the\nday his mother gave birth to him\n’”.  (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nWhile here, the pilgrim should perform each prayer (\nDhuhr\n,\nAsr\n,\nMaghrib\n,\nIsha\nand\nFajr\n) in its time.  They shouldn’t\ncombine prayers, but each four unit prayer is shortened to two units.\nThere is a very interesting\nmasjid\nin Mina.  It is known as Masjid Kheef.  The Prophet, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said:\n“Seventy Prophets\nperformed prayer in this\nmasjid\n.”\n(\nBaihaqi\n)\nIt is not required of one to visit that\nmasjid\nor to pray there, some may carry this belief, but there is no\nbasis for it.\nDepending on the bus schedule for your\nHajj\ngroup, you may move from Mina to the next stop in\nHajj\nshortly after the\nFajr\nprayer or before the\nDhuhr\nprayer of the 9th day of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.\nThe 9\nth\nDay of\nDhul-Hijjah\nThe 9\nth\nday of\nDhul-Hijja"

One of the best things one can do is to supplicate to Allah for all\nthat they desire in this life and in the next.  Some may perceive it to be\ninappropriate to ask Allah for worldly riches, but there is no sin in doing\nthis.  In fact, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,\nsupplicated for Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying:\n“O Allah\nincrease him in wealth, and give him many children and bless him in that.”\n[1]\nOne\nshould make an extra effort to repent and pledge to Allah that they will turn a\nnew page in their lives.\nAt sunset, one is to leave the area of Arafah for\nMuzdalifah\n[2]\n. \nSince one will be with a\nHajj\ngroup, they may leave a bit earlier.  Upon\narriving at Muzdalifah one should perform the\nMaghrib\nprayer and\nIsha\nprayer (combining them and shortening the Isha to two units) thus allowing\noneself a good night’s rest thereafter.  A common mistake that is committed by\nmany is that they will spend their night chatting, taking selfies or surfing\nthe net.  This is inappropriate, as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of\nAllah be upon him, indicated that one should spend this night resting as much\nas they can.  One should continue saying the\nTalbiyah\nat this stage of\nthe pilgrimage.\nThe 10\nth\nDay (The Day of\nEid\n)\nThis is the ‘action-packed’ day for the pilgrim.  The\nmajority of the\nHajj\nrituals are performed herein.  It is best that one\nfollows this day’s rituals in the manner that Prophet Muhammad performed them\nin.\nUpon getting up for the Fajr prayer and performing it,\none is to utilize that time to supplicate to Allah, as well one should gather 7\nsmall ‘chickpea’ sized stones for the ritual of stoning that takes place on\nthis day.\nTaking a few extra is recommended\n.\nUsually after this, the\nHajj\ngroup will take the\npilgrims back to Mina, where they will stone the biggest pillar, which is\nclosest to Mecca.  This pillar is known as Jamaratul-Aqabah.  It should be\nnoted that these pillars are not the ‘devil’, but simply a pillar.  In relation\nto the reason behind this ritual, one can find its roots in the story of\nProphet Abraham and Ismail, peace be upon them both.  The devil had approached\nIsmail and tried to convince him to disobey his father in these three locations. \nToday stoning is conducted in obedience to the commandment of our Prophet.  With\neach stone that is thrown one is to say ‘\nAllahu Akbar\n’.\nAfter stoning the Jamratul-Aqabah, one is to have their\nsacrificial animal slaughtered.  Nowadays, this process is more or less\nautomated through one of the large corporations that takes care of this on\nbehalf of the pilgrims.  Once this step is ascertained, one can shave off or\ntrim their hair evenly.  For women, it is sufficient to clip off a small amount\nof hair.\nOnce these actions are completed, one would then head\ntowards the Haram to perform what is known as\nTawaf\nAl-Ifaadah, and the\nSa’ee\nof\nHajj\n.  These are the five actions that one should perform in this day. \nOnce the\nTawaf\nis about to be performed, one should stop saying the\nTalbiyah\nand instead say: “\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La ilaahah il-lal-lah.  Allahu\nAkbar, Allahu Akbar, Wa-lil-laahil-hamd\n”.\n[3]\nDue to the infinite mercy of Islam, the Prophet gave\nus permits which make it easy for us this great undertaking.  Imagine, if all\nthe pilgrims had to strictly follow this order, what immense and massive\ndifficulty would there be upon people! In fact, the Prophet, was approached by\nmany companions who had informed him that they did not do the actions of this\nday in his sequence.  The Prophet said to them:\n“You may do that, and there\nis no sin upon you!”\nOne Companion even came to him and said: “O Prophet of\nAllah, I performed\nSa’ee\nbefore I made the\nTawaf\n!” The Prophet\nsaid:\n“You may do that, and there is no sin upon you!”\n[4]\nIf this is the pilgrims first\nHajj\n, they should\nstay with their groups.  Getting lost during any stage of\nHajj\nwill be a\nmemorable exp"

Upon saying\nthis one enters the state of\nIhram\n.\nThey would then begin to chant the\nTalbiyah\nsaying:\n“Labbaik Allaahumma labbaik, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik, innal-hamda\nwan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak”\n[5]\n.\nThey continue to chant this until they reach the\nKabah\nand\nbegin to perform the\nTawaf\n.  A man is to uncover his right shoulder\nthroughout the\nTawaf\n; this is done by placing the middle part of the\nRidaa\nunder the right arm and tossing both ends of the sheet on the left shoulder.\nThereafter one is to circumambulate around the\nKabah\nseven times; each time begins from the Black Stone.  One is not required to\nphysically touch or kiss it, but when one is in line with it, they begin their\ncircumambulation at that point.  During the\nTawaf\none should be mindful\nof Allah, asking of Him and begging for His mercy.  One should avoid\nidle talk and laughter, for this maybe a once in a lifetime\nchance which should not be squandered heedlessly!\nIt is praiseworthy for one to walk with a faster pace in\nthe first three rounds.\nThe Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be\nupon him, would say the following between the Yemeni corner and the Black\nStone:\nRabbanaa"

As covered in part one, entering the\nstate of\nIhram\nis a pillar of this great ritual. Since it is a very\nessential part of the\nUmrah\nand\nHajj\nexperience, it is necessary\nto shed further light on the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of this state.\nPraiseworthy Practices\n1.It is preferable to take the ritual bath before entering the\nstate of\nIhram\n.\n2.Cutting the fingernails, shortening the mustache, and\nplucking/shaving armpit and pubic hair before entering the state of\nIhram\n.\n3.Entering the state of\nIhram\nafter performing an\nobligatoryprayer.\n[1]\n4.Saying the\nTalbiyah\n: ‘\nLabbaik Allaahumma labbaik…\n’\nafter entering the state of\nIhram\n. Men should raise their voices while\nsaying it and women can say it quietly to themselves.\nPractices that should be avoided\nPractices that should be avoided are referred to as ‘\nMahdthoorat’\nof\nIhram\n. These actions are not lawful for one who is in the state of\nIhram\n.\nThey are divided into three categories; one specific to men, one specific to\nwomen and one that is relevant to both.\nProhibited for Men and Women during the state of\nIhram\n:\n1.Cutting hair or shaving it from any part of the body.\n2.Clipping fingernails or toenails.\n3.Wearing perfume, regardless how subtle the scent.\n4.Hunting game animals.\n5.Consummating Marriage.\n6.\nMubasharah\n(i.e. contacting a woman skin to skin) or\ndoing a thing which may lead to it such as kissing or fondling.\n7.Sexual intercourse.\nSpecifically Prohibited for Men:\n1.Covering the head directly with a hat or a turban. Umbrellas or\nsitting in the shade of a vehicle or in a tent are allowed.\n2.Wearing sewn garments that are usually worn, such as\nunder-pants, t-shirts and other similar articles of clothing.\nSpecifically Prohibited for Women:\nA woman should not cover her face unless men pass by\nher. She can wear whatever she wants as long as it conforms to the Islamic\ndress code, and she should cover her hair and she should not wear gloves.\nDoing the\nMahdthoorat\nignorantly\nIf someone does one of these ignorantly he is excused. Whoever\ndoes one of the above\nMahdthoorat\nafter entering the state of\nIhram\nintentionally\nwould have committed a sin, and would be required to fast\nthree days or feed six poor/needy individuals.\nPractices that are Lawful\n1.Taking a shower.\n2.Wearing a ring.\n3.Wearing a belt.\n4.Wearing sandals.\n5.Using an umbrella.\n6.Using a bandage.\n7.Riding a bus.\n8.Wearing a watch.\n9.Wearing sunglasses.\nUnauthentic Practices\nDue to the sheer number of people who come from all\nwalks of life for the\nUmrah\nthroughout the course of the year, it is\nimportant that one not give in to popular beliefs that may be carried by some.\nIslam is a religion of ease, not difficulty! Allah, the Exalted, says:\n“And thus we have made you a just/moderate nation.” (Quran 2:143)\nIn light of this verse, we will mention here some odd\nbeliefs carried by some. One should be watchful for them and not subscribe to\nthem:\n1.Believing that you need a special pair of sandals for\nUmrah\n.\n2.Entering the state of\nIhram\nbefore the\nMiqat\nstation.\n3.Chanting\nTalbiyah\nin a unison voice with a group.\n4.Raising the hands, as done in prayer, when facing the Black\nStone.\n5.Putting the right hand on the left hand during the\nTawaf\n(circumambulation around the\nKabah\n)\n6.Making a specific supplication at each of the corners of the\nKabah\n.\n7.Kissing the Yemeni corner\n[2]\n.\n8.Seeking blessings from the\nKabah\nby wiping its walls with\na cloth or with the garment of\nIhram\n.\n9.Kissing and touching\nMaqam\nof Ibrahim (Station of\nIbrahim).\n10.Praying two\nrakahs\nafter completing the\nSa'ee\n.\nIt is important for a Muslim to always follow the\nexample of our beloved Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be"

Hence they are from\nAllah and authentic.  No human being made them up.  What is their spirit? Our\nProphet told us,\n“They are days of eating, drinking, and remembrance\nof Allah.”\n[1]\nIn other words, we can enjoy and have\nhalal\n,\nwholesome fun without forgetting our Creator.\nBefore\nEid ul-Adha\nAs stated earlier,\nEid ul-Adha\nis tied to\nHajj\n. \nPerforming\nHajj\nis one of the five pillars of Islam that is performed in\nthe 12\nth\nmonth of the Islamic calendar known as “\nDhul-Hijjah\n.”\nEid ul-Adha\nis celebrated by Muslims all over the world on the 10\nth\nday of the month of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.  The first ten days of this month have\na special merit.  In Arabic, they are known as\n‘al-Ayyam ul-Ashr.’\nThe\nseason of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s\nfaults and make up for shortcomings or anything that one might have missed.\nVirtues of the ‘Ten Days’\nThe following are five virtues of the\n‘al-Ayyam\nul-Ashr’\n(the Ten Days):\n1.    Allah swears an oath by them in the Quran,\nand swearing an oath by something shows us it’s paramount significance and genuine\nbenefit.  Allah says:\n“By the dawn; by the ten nights” (Quran 89:1-2)\nEarly authorities of Quran have\nexplained that this verse refers to the first ten days of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.\n2.    To further convince us of their merit, the Prophet\ntestified that these are the “best”\ndays\nin the world.  The\nTen\nDays\nare better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the\nlast ten days of\nRamadan\n! But the last ten\nnights\nof\nRamadan\nare better, because they include\nLaylat al-Qadr\n(“the Night of Power”).\n3.    There are no days greater in the sight of\nAllah and in which good deeds are more loved by Him than these ten days, so a\nMuslim must frequently recite “\nSubhanAllah\n”, “\nAlhamdulillah\n” and “\nAllahu\nAkbar\n” during this time.\n4.    The Ten Days include the days of sacrifice\nand\nHajj\n.\n5.    The 9th day of\nDhul-Hijjah\nis called\n‘Yaum\nul Arafah’\n(The Day of\nArafah\n).  This is the day when the pilgrims\nassemble on the plain of\nArafah\n, six miles away from Mecca.  The Day of\nArafah\nitself has many virtues.\nVirtues And Practices of\nDay of Arafah\n1.\nYaum al-Arafah\nis the day on which\nAllah completed the religion of Islam.\n2.\nYaum al-Arafah\nis one of the biggest\ngatherings of any place in the world.\n3.\nYaum al-Arafah\nis a day on which prayers"

such as\na sheep, camel, or goat.  The practice is often misunderstood by those outside of\nthe faith.  Therefore, several points must be understood here:\nFirst, there are no special\nrituals involved, other than the animal meeting certain requirements.  The\nanimal is slaughtered in the same way it is slaughtered any other time in the year. \nThe only difference is in the intention.  For regular slaughter, the intention\nis the meat, but for\nEid ul-Adha\n, it is to worship Allah by commemorating\nAbraham’s trial.\nTwo, God’s Name is\npronounced since Allah has given us power over animals and allowed us to\nconsume their meat, but only in His Name.  By saying the Name of Allah at the\ntime of slaughter, we remind ourselves that even the life of an animal is\nsacred and we can only take away it’s life in the Name of the One who gave it\nin the first place.\nThree, good acts atone for\none’s sins.  Offering\nudhiyyah\nis an act of worship that is no exception. \nProphet Muhammad said that the most beloved deed on\nEid ul-Adha\nis\noffering the\nudhiyyah\nand that it will come on the Day of Resurrection\nwith its horns, cloven hoofs, and hair.  Its blood is accepted by Allah before\nit reaches the ground.  “So let your heart delight in it.” (Tirmidhi, Ibn\nMajah)\nLaws of\nUdhiyyah\nfor\nEid ul-Adha\na)  Type of Animal\nA single\nsheep\ncan be offered as a sacrifice for\na single person or a family.  “At the time of the Messenger of Allah, a man\nwould sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household,\nand they would eat from it and give some to others.”\n[1]\nA camel or cow is\nsufficient for seven people, because of the report\n“A cow would be\nsacrificed on behalf of seven men and we would share it.”\n[2]\nb)  Age of Animal\nThe animal should be of a certain age to be fit for\nudhiyyah\n. \nThe minimum ages are:\na)6 months for a lamb or sheep.\nb)1\nyear for a goat.\nc)2 years for a cow.\nd)5\nyears for a camel.\nc)  Characteristics of the Animal\nIt should be free of any faults, because the Prophet\nsaid,\n“There are four that will not do for sacrifice:\na)\na one-eyed animal whose defect is obvious,\nb)\na sick animal whose sickness is obvious,\nc)\na lame animal whose limp is obvious and\nd)\nan emaciated animal that has no marrow in its bones.”\n[3]\nThere are milder defects that do not disqualify an\nanimal, but it is disliked to sacrifice such animals, like an animal with a\nhorn or ear missing, or with slits in its ears, etc.  If the animal is\ncastrated, it is not considered a fault.\nd)  Time of Sacrifice\nIt should be sacrificed at the specified time, which is after\nthe prayer and\nkhutbah\nof\nEid ul-Adha\nhas concluded until before\nsunset of the 13th day of\nDhul-Hijjah\n.  The Prophet said:\n“Whoever sacrifices before the prayer let him repeat\nit.”\n[4]\nThe meat from the sacrifice of\nEid ul-Adha\nis\neaten by family and relatives, given away to friends, and donated to the poor. \nWe recognize that all blessings come from Allah, and we should open our hearts\nand share with others.\nCalendar of Eid ul-Adha from 2013-2015 CE\nThe exact dates of Eid ul-Adha will be determined based\non moon sighting, but the rough dates are as follows:\nTue Oct 15    2013\nSun Oct 5      2014\nThu Sep 24    2015\nSunnahs\n(Recommended deeds) of\nEid al-Adha\nThe following are recommended acts that bring additional\nreward on\nEid ul-Adha\n.  No need to worry if you forget some, but try to\ndo as many as possible to maximize your reward.\n1.The Prophet used to take a complete ritual bath (\nghusl\n) on\nthe day of\nEid\n.\n2.The Prophet used to wear his best clothes to go to the\nEid\nprayer.  Both men and women should observe the proper, modest Islamic dress when\nthey go out for the\nEid\nprayer.\n3.The Prophet would take different routes for going and coming\nback from the\nEid\nprayer.\n4.Another\nsunnah\n(recommended deed) is to pronounce Allah’s\ngreatness with these words:\nAllahu\nakbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha il-lal-lah, wa-Allah"

It\nconsists of two\nrakahs\n, with extra\ntakbirs\n(saying ‘Allahu\nAkbar’). The wisdom behind the\nEid\nprayers, like the\nEid\ndays\nthemselves, is to thank Allah for His countless blessings. The\nimam\nwill\npray in one of two ways. He will explain how he is praying before the beginning\nof the prayer:\nMETHOD 1\nIn the first\nrakah\nof the\nEid\nprayer, the\nimam\nwill offer 3 additional\ntakbirs\nafter the\nTakbiratul-Ihram\nand\nopening supplication but before reciting the\nFatihah\n. Raise your hands\nwith each\ntakbir\n, as one does for\nTakbiratul-Ihram\n. After each\ntakbir\n,\nlet the hands rest at the sides. Place hands together after the third and final\ntakbir\n. After this, the rest of the\nrakah\nis the same.\nIn the second\nrakah\nof the\nEid\nprayer the\nimam\nwill recite the\nFatihah\nand some portion of the Quran. He will then say\n3 additional\ntakbirs\n. They are like the first\nrakah’s\ntakbirs\n,\nexcept that you leave your hands to your sides after the third\ntakbir.\nAfter\nthese three\ntakbirs\nhave been called and completed, one says the\ntakbir\nfor going into\nruku\n, without raising one’s hands.\nMETHOD 2\nLike any prayer, the prayer begins with\nTakbiratul-Ihram\nfollowed by the opening supplication. It is followed by 7\ntakbeers\nin\nthe first\nrakah\nand 5 additional\ntakbeers\nin the second\nrakah\n.\nRest of the prayer is like any other prayer.\nGreetings Exchanged On\nEid ul-Adha\nNot knowing the greetings flying around during\nEid\ncan be an uncomfortable experience. Not exchanging any greeting is perfectly\nacceptable in Islam, but socially awkward. Therefore, knowing what are the\ngreetings and their appropriate response will help you with social acceptance.\nPeople from India and Pakistan congratulate one another\nby saying “\nEid Mubarak\n” (Blessed\nEid\n).\nArabs tend to say “Eid Saeed” (Happy Eid) or ‘\nkullu\n‘aam wa antum bi-khair\n’ (may each year bring you good health).\nThe Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say, ‘\ntaqabalallahu\nminna wa minkum\n’ (May Allah accept it from us and from you).\nThey are all fine. Simply respond by repeating the same greeting\nback! It will be fine if you smile or ask for help in repeating back the words.\nAdvice for\nEid ul-Adha\n1.    Take the day of\nEid\noff from work or school.\nIf you cannot, please make arrangements for time off for at least the\nEid\nprayer.\n2.    Make arrangements for the sacrificial animal\nahead of time. You can go with local Muslims to a ranch or a slaughter house.\nIt will be an experience you will not forget! You may want to slaughter the\nanimal yourself or you can have a fellow Muslim do it for you. You can also\nsend money to an Islamic charity to do it on your behalf and they will distribute\nthe meat to the poor. For millions of Muslims it is the only time in the year\nthey get to eat meat. You can locate many charities by doing an online search\nfor “udhiyyah 2013.”\nAt least for the first few years after accepting Islam,\nI will recommend that you simply send the money to feed poor Muslims overseas\neither through your mosque or one of the online Islamic relief organizations.  You\ncan join the local Muslims to get the experience if you like. Costs of doing\nudhiyyah\noverseas will vary based on the country you want it to be performed in. A few\norganizations are listed below, you can find many more online:\nhttp://www.irusa.org\nhttp://icnarelief.org\nwww.zakat.org\n3.    Call your local mosque or Islamic center a\nweek before\nEid ul-Adha\nto find out the time and place where\nEid\nul-Adha\nprayer will be held. After the\nEid\nprayer, ethnic sweets and\nfoods are usually served. Most mosques will hold\nEid\ndinners either in\nthe evening or within the next few days. Find out when and where they are and\nattend them.\n4.    Do not get lonely or feel isolated. Make\narrangements with your Muslim friends or families ahead of time to visit them for\nEid ul-Adha\n. Invite Muslim friends and cook for them. If you can’t cook,\neat out with them. Try to involve your non-Muslim family members by taking them\nto"

And there is none co-equal or comparable unto\nHim.’” (Quran 112)\nIkhlas\nis being honest with Allah, and worshipping\nHim with\nihsan\n.\nIkhlas\nis closely linked to\nihsan\n.  When\na person is consistently aware that Allah sees all he is more likely to\nremember the importance of\nikhlas\n.  When a person does something\nsincerely for Allah, he or she is no longer concerned with receiving praise or\nreward from anyone but Allah.   It does not matter who sees you or who does not\nsee you.  Sometimes a deed can be done for Allah’s sake but the intention is\ntainted with boasting and showing off; this is\nriyaa\nand it may nullify\nthe rewards that a believer is seeking.  More information about\nriyaa\ncan be found here,\nhttp://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/96/\nand will be discussed further in part 2.\n“And whether you hide what is in your breast or reveal it,\nAllah knows it…” (Quran 3:29)\n“…And if you join others in worship with Allah surely your\ndeeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers.” (Quran 39:65)\nIn order that a believer’s deeds and actions are\naccepted by Allah they must be performed with\nikhlas\n, they must be\npreceded by the right intention and they must be carried out according to the\nshariah\n.\n“And they were commanded not but they should worship Allah and\nworship none but him alone, and give\nzakah\n, and that is the right\nreligion.” (Quran 98:5)\nProphet Muhammad emphasised that, “Allah is Pure and He\naccepts only that which is pure”\n[1]\nthus\nthe\nSunnah\ngives prominence to the fact that Allah accepts only that\nwhich is pure and done solely for His sake.  For example, Khalid ibn al-Walid\nwas removed from his post as commander of the army by Caliph Umar.  Rather than\nbeing offended and refusing to fight, Khalid fought even harder.  When he was\nasked why, he said: “I fight for Allah not for Umar.”\nSay, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and\nmy dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (Quran 6:162)\nThe acceptance of a person’s deeds by Allah depends on\npurity and sincerity; because it is with such\nikhlas\nthat a person can\nattain a high rank in the sight of Allah.   In fact with the right intention and\na pure heart a person can even be rewarded for an action that they were unable\nto perform.  Prophet Muhammad said, “Verily Allah has recorded the good deeds\nand the evil deeds.” He then informed those around him that, “Whosoever intends\nto do a good deed but does not do it, Allah records it with Himself as a\ncomplete good deed…”\n[2]\nEveryday life causes our le"

i-e, riyaa\n.\nRiyaa\nis in fact\nminor\nshirk\n, it makes us focus on gaining the admiration and\nappreciation of people rather than seeking to please Allah.\nA great scholar of Islam once said, “Indeed\nthe hardest thing to achieve in this world is\nikhlas\n.  How many times\nhave I struggled to extinguish\nriyaa\n(showing off) from my heart except\nthat it only appeared again in a different colour”?\n[1]\nIt is clear from\nthis statement that even the most educated people struggle to remain sincere\nand avoid\nriyaa.\nBut indeed it is something that we must avoid.   Prophet\nMuhammad said that it was the thing he feared most for his\nUmmah\n.  “Indeed\nthe thing that I fear most for you is the minor\nshirk\n,” he said.  The\nsahabah\nasked, “And what is minor\nshirk\n, Oh Messenger of Allah?” To which he\nreplied, “It is\nRiyaa\n.  Allah will say to the people of\nriyaa\non\nthe Day of Judgement – when the people are being re-payed for their deeds – ‘Go\nto those who you showed off your deeds to in the\ndunya\n, and see if you\ncan find reward from them!’”\n[2]\nThere is also a\nhadith qudsi\nin\nwhich Allah says, “I am Independent of all the partners (ascribed to me).  Whoever\nperforms a deed while associating partners with Me, I will leave him and\nhis\nshirk\n.”\n[3]\nRiyaa\ncan be defined as the performance of a deed with the intention\nof pleasing someone or something other than Allah.  It is a form of\nshirk\nand something to be feared because it is easy to fall into\nriyaa\nwithout\nnoticing.\nOur good deeds and actions can be\nnullified by\nriyaa\n.  Let us take the example of a man who has $100 he\nwants to give in charity.   He begins his act of charity with a pure and\nsincere heart and donates $50 but then the idea of showing how rich he is\noccurs to him so he makes quite a performance of giving another $50.   It is\npossible that Allah will reject the second $50 as an act of charity because it\nwas mixed with a desire to show off.  If however the idea of showing off\noccurred after the total $100 had been distributed it would not affect or\ninvalidate the act of charity.\nHaving said this it is important to\nbear in mind that it is not showing off if a person feels happy after doing an\nact of worship.  This is a sign of faith.   Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and\nblessings of Allah be upon him, said “Whoever feels happy because of his good\ndeeds and sad because of his bad deeds, is a believer.”\n[4]\nIn addition, if people praise you for a\ngood deed it is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of, it is a porti"

jumping out of your skin\nexciting.  Thus on discovery, the first thing you want to do is tell other\npeople, and sometimes just blurting out one of life’s universal truths can be a\nlittle bit confronting.  Some might think you are crazy or deluded, but that is\nnot the problem, because that puts you in such noble company as Prophet\nMuhammad or Prophet Noah.  The problem is that when we invite people to the\ntruth of Islam we want them to listen and understand just what it is we are\ntrying to say.  Therefore for the benefit of those jumping out of their skin we\nwill discuss a few tips for inviting others to the right path.\nFirst off let us get our definitions in sync.  The verb,\ninvite,\nmeans to request the presence or participation of in a kindly,\ncourteous, or complimentary way.\n[1]\nShariah\nliterally means ‘a path to water,’ the source of all life, thus\nIslamically\nShariah\nis the straight path to Allah, the Giver and\nOriginator of all life.   Allah tells us to:\n“Invite (call) to the way of your\nRabb\nwith wisdom and\nbeautiful preaching and argue with them in a way that is better...”  (Qur’an\n16:125)\nWhenever we invite a person to Islam, to the right path,\nwe are presenting them with the attractions and allurements of Islam.   Our job\nis to deliver the message in the best way possible according to our knowledge\nand abilities.  Acceptance or rejection of the message is up to the person\nconcerned; there is no compulsion in religion and moreover it is Allah who\nbestows guidance.\nWe\nare not converting or reverting them because it is\nAllah, and Allah only that truly does that.  Our role is only to assist others\non their journey or to plant a seed that will one day,\nInshaAllah\n, grow\ninto a tree of Islam.\n“Let there be no compulsion in religion.  Truth has been made\nclear from error…” (Quran 2:256)\n“…Say, ‘To Allah belongs the east and the west.  He guides\nwhom He wills to a straight path.’” (Quran 2:142)\nIt is important to remember however that conveying the\nmessage and calling people to Islam or giving\ndawah\n, as many like to\ncall it, is an obligation upon all Muslims.  Of course we are not all expected\nto work in the field of\ndawah\nbut we are expected to be aware at all\ntimes that our behaviour, words and actions, are\ndawah\n.  Those not\nfamiliar with Islam look to Muslims to see just what this religion is all about. \nProphet Muhammad said, “Convey from me, even if it is one verse”.\n[2]\nQuran also\nreiterates the same message.\n“...  And who is better in speech than one who invites to\nAllah and does righteousness and says, ‘Indeed, I am of the Muslims. ’” (Quran\n41:33)\nIt all sounds very easy doesn’t it?  We all love Allah\nand His Messenger Muhammad and without a doubt we hope that all people will one\nday feel the same way.  However love for Islam and all it entails is not quite\nenough.  When one accepts the challenge to convey the message one needs to be\nprepared.  No longer can we scowl at the shopkeeper when prices rise.  No\nlonger can we react with anger when somebody mumbles an insult as we walk by.  A\nperson delivering the message of Islam must be prepared to accept insults, be\npatient, make sacrifices, and listen to ideas and ideologies that are far from\nthe truth of Islam.  Prophet Muhammad said that, “The believer who mixes with\npeople and bears their insults with patience is better than the one who does\nnot mix with people or bear their insults with patience.”\n[3]\nAnyone who is recognisably Muslim is conveying the\nmessage every time they appear in public or mix with non-believers, therefore our\nwords should always be kind and gentle, and our temper must be completely under\ncontrol so that harsh words never leave our mouths.  One of Prophet Muhammad’s\ncompanions said, “We smile at people even if in our hearts we are cursing their\nwords or behaviour”.\n[4]\nMoreover a Muslim makes things easy for others.  This is what Allah expects and\nProphet Muhammad encouraged when he said, “Teach and make things easy, do not\nmake them difficult.  If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.”\n[5]\n“...  Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make\nthings difficult for you…” (Quran 2:185)\nProphet Muhammad understood human weaknesses and at the\nsame time understood human potential for excellence.  His\ndawah\nmet"

    "fullText": "Objectives\n·Understand the meaning of “supernatural”.\n·Identify the sources of supernatural harm:\ndemons, “evil eye,” and witchcraft.\n·Appreciate that evil in our lives is not\noutside of Allah’s control.\n·Learn how to protect ourselves by prayers\nand invocations revealed by Allah\nThese days supernatural phenomenon\nis stressed in most modern fiction, movies, and TV programs.  Everyone has read\nabout witches, sorcerers, vampires, wandering spirits, and werewolves.  While\nmuch of it is just that – fiction, according to Islamic teachings, there is an\nelement of truth to the supernatural phenomenon.  Some people may have direct\nexperience of the horror out there, who have always had questions, but never\nhad the right answers.\nFirst we need to understand what is meant by\nsupernatural phenomenon.  “The Supernatural” is what lies outside nature and\nhence outside science as well.  Therefore, what is supernatural seems\ninherently mysterious and therefore scary.  Human beings fear what they do not\nknow.\nTherefore, to sort out fact from fiction, we rely on the\nonly true source of supernatural knowledge, and that is Allah’s revelation\ncontained in the Quran and the\nSunnah\nof Prophet Muhammad.  Once we\nunderstand that the supernatural can be understood through revelation, we\nconquer our fear of the unknown as we learn ways Allah has taught us to keep us\nsafe and protected.\nAccording to Islamic teachings, the following are the\nmajor sources of supernatural harm:\nJinn and demons\nThe jinn are real and they are creatures\ncreated by Allah.  Among them are demons (disbelieving jinn) and believers.  They\ncan see us but we cannot see them.  Demons can attack human beings and\nterrorize them.  A demon may also possess the body of a human because it either\nfell in love with the human or to harm him, or possibly another reason.\nEnvy and jealousy of others\nDestructive envy means wishing that a\nblessing that Allah has given another person be taken away.  Wishing to have\nwhat somebody else has (an object or skill) is not envy, desiring it to be\ntaken away from them is what makes it destructive.\n“Evil eye”\nThe “evil eye” is when a person hurts another\nwith his “stare.” The starting point is when the person likes something, and\nthen by repeatedly looking at the object of his jealousy, his evil feelings\naffect it.  To clarify this in a more simple tone, if a person is in the\npresence of someone whom he wishes to marry, and she happens to smile in his\ndirection, the individual may feel lightheaded and even dizzy at that point;\nlikewise, when a person is standing before someone whom he fears, such as his\nboss, and he dreads that he will be fired, and he is suddenly called, that\nperson will feel a slight sensation of pain and may even faint. The evil eye\nincorporates this aspect, as well it goes beyond by the nature of one’s\nself…the jealousy and pure hatred a person has for a blessing someone is\nblessed with and the burning desire that he has to see it removed. Everyone who\nputs the “evil eye” on another is envious, but everyone who envies does not put\nthe “evil eye” on another.\nWitchcraft and sorcery\nWitchcraft and sorcery are real and may\naffect people psychologically and physically, so that they become sick and even\nhusbands and wives can be separated.  Most of it is done by means of\nShirk\nand by offering demons what they love.\nThe truth is that in and of itself, nothing is capable of\nhurting you unless Allah allows it to.  In other words, you should have a firm\nbelief that Allah is in control, not any created being.  That is why, a Muslim\nshould not let paranoia, anxiety, doubts, suspicion, and excessive fear of the paranormal\noverwhelm him so much that he becomes afflicted with psychological illnesses.  One\nshould think positively about Allah and understand that whatever befalls only\nhappens by the permission of Allah.  Evil is not outside of Allah’s control.  There\nis no sorcerer, demon, or “evil eye” that is stronger than Allah.  Since, He is\nin control, He alone is able to ward off harm and relieve distress.  If this is\nunderstood, a person will turn to Allah and put his complete faith in Him.\nIn order to properly trust Allah, a Muslim must have the\ncorrect belief and knowledge.  First, Allah knows what’s best.  Allah says in\nthe Quran,\n“… Perhaps you may dislike something and it is good for you\nand you may like something and it is bad for you.  Allah knows and you do not\nknow.” (Quran 2:216)\nSecond, Allah is Just.  He tells us,\n“… And your Lord will not wrong anyone.” (Quran 18:49)\nThird, Allah is sufficient for anyone who puts their\ntrust in Him.  He has declared,\n“…And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice\nhim...” (Quran 65:3)\nA Muslim can protect himself by giving up sins, carrying\nout obligatory religious duties, having strong faith in Allah, by putting his\ntrust in Him as explained above, and seeking refuge with Him by reciting the\nprayers for protection narrated from Prophet Muhammad.\nWhat will follow in the"

 You have no other deity other than Him.  Certainly, I fear for\nyou the torment of a Great Day!’” (Quran 7:59)\nAccording to learned people both past and present, any\ncall to Islam that does not begin with\nTawheed\nis doomed to failure.   Prophet\nMuhammad instructed the\nsahabah\nto preach\nTawheed\nwhen sending\nthem to various communities.  To those who went to Yemen he said, “You are\ngoing to the People of the Book, so let the first thing that you invite them to\nbe the\nTawheed\nof Allah”.\n[1]\nThe title ‘People of the Book’ refers to the Jews and\nthe Christians, those given scriptures for guidance before the Quran was\nrevealed.   It is often easier to start a conversation about Islam with Christians\nand Jews because they already believe in God.  Quran is filled with references,\nand stories that can be easily related to and to which they already have their\nown versions.  For instance mentioning the\nsurahs\nof Quran that are\nnamed after easily recognisable people such as\nsurah\n19 – Maryam (Mary),\nsurah\n14 - Ibrahim  (Abraham) or\nsurah\n12 – Yusuf (Joseph).\nQuran beseeches Prophet Muhammad to call the People of\nthe Book to Islam.  And Prophet Muhammad in his\nSunnah\nmade clear the\nrelationship between all of the prophets and messengers of Allah.\n“Say O Muhammad ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and\nChristians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship\nnone but God (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none\nof us shall take others as lords besides God.’” (Quran 3:64)\n“And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be\nin (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say, ‘We\nbelieve in that which has been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God\nand your God is One, and to Him we have submitted’”.  (Quran 29:46)\n“I am the nearest of all the people to the son of\nMary, and all the prophets are brothers and there is none between me and him (i.e. \nthere is no other prophet between me and Jesus).”\n[2]\n“If a man believes in Jesus and then believes in me\nhe will get double reward.”\n[3]\nPeople who have no understanding of any of the three\nmonotheistic religions, such as Buddhists require different guidelines.  It is the\nresponsibility of the person giving\ndawah\nto have a basic understanding\nof the beliefs of the non-believers they are calling to.  Buddhism for instance\nis a way of life, but not in the same sense as Islam.  Put simply Buddhism, as\nwell as many eastern religions have a concept by which the person who does good\nactions will eventually attain Godlike qualities.   On the other hand Hindus\nbelieve in one Supreme God among many, and some of the more obscure religions\nsuch as Zoroastrianism and Baha’i do include the concept of One Supreme God.  However,\nyou do not want to speak down to anyone as if you know more about their belief\nsystem then they do themselves.  This is important whether that is the case or\nnot.  Remember, you do not want to offend anybody or inadvertently start an\nargument.  More information about other religious beliefs can be found on our\nother website\nwww.islamreligion.com\n.\nIf a person has a strong belief in God or even a\nnameless Supreme Being responsible for the creation, it is possible to teach\nthem that the God we call Allah is the same God that they call by other names\nsuch as Elohim or Yahweh."

As mentioned\nearlier it is Allah that provides the guidance and the desire to accept Islam.\nRemember that whenever we intend to convey the message we must do so with\nwisdom, eloquent speech and in the most gracious manner. Arguments and heated\ndiscussions are not the best methods of\ndawah.\nOne who has accepted Islam must convey the message to\nthose nearest and dearest to him. Once a person has tasted the sweetness of\nfaith it becomes impossible not to desire that for all family members and\nfriends. Calling family members must be a first priority but sometimes it can\nbe the hardest work of all. Sometimes when you are the first member of your\nfamily to heed the message you plunge the other members of your family into a\nstate of shock; especially if they do not mix with any Muslims in their daily\nlives.\nYour family needs a little time to accept the reality.\nMake sure you have a supply of easy to read small books or pamphlets. If you\nlive at home you could leave them lying around, if not keep a supply in your\nbag or car. People often want to know this or that and sometimes you simply do\nnot know the answer to all those questions. You are often just learning\nyourself so don’t be tempted to make up an answer. Perhaps you could look it up\ntogether remembering to always emphasis the Oneness of Allah, the Creator of\nall that exists.\nYour family and close friends will be watching closely\nand this is when your behaviour will play a big part. You have probably given\nup a lot of big things such as alcohol, parties, free mixing with the opposite gender,\nand pork and pork products.  However, you have also added lots of little things;\nmore kind acts, generosity, eagerness to be helpful, more gracious manners and\na desire to establish strong unbreakable family ties. Showing kindness and\nobserving high moral standards is possibly the best way to introduce someone to\nIslam. Good manners and courteous behaviour is also a very good form of\ndawah\n.\nYou are a role model for what Islam is all about.\nProphet Muhammad’s behaviour attracted others to Islam.\nHis beloved wife Aisha called his character a living example of the Quran.\n[1]\nHe was kind and courteous to everybody and even his enemies could not help but\npraise his noble character. This is the behaviour we must endeavour to emulate\nand the people that will benefit the most are our family and close friends. A\nkind word, a smile, a gift, or help of any sort, will showcase the beauty of\nIslam.\nBe particularly careful not to despair when you see your\nfamily or friends engaging in behaviour that you now consider misconduct. Do\nnot abandon them because of their ways. You can leave their company if they are\ndrinking alcohol or acting in a non-Islamic manner - abandon the place, or the\nsituation, not the person. Invite them to your house and to your events so they\ncan see that fun and happiness can be found without alcohol or distasteful\nentertainment.\nConversations at your workplace are also a way to spread\nthe message of Islam. Handing out pamphlets probably isn’t going to win you any\nfriends or influence people but your mannerisms and ways of dealing with people\nwill. Remember however that your colleagues are likely to be as shocked as your\nfamily. If you have recently converted to Islam don’t expect fanfare and\ncongratulations but do expect curiosity. Again don’t give unqualified answers\nto things you are not sure about. The one thing you are sure about is the\nOneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped.\nNever give up hope. You may not see the people you love\nentering Islam and it can be a source of great disappointment. However it is\nwise to remember that it is Allah that guides a person to the right path.  Your\nrole in that process might be as little as being a friendly face in an\notherwise bleak day. Hope is something that Muslims have in abundance, so make\nsmall efforts and lots of\ndu’a\nfor the people you love and those around\nyou.\nSpreading the message and calling people to the right\npath is the work that was carried out by all of Allah’s messengers. Each one\ncalled his own people to the One God, Allah.  Prophet Muhammad however was sent\nto all of humankind; he gave the good news to the believers of immense reward\nin the Hereafter, and warning the unbelievers against a severe punishment.\nProphet Muhammad expected all of those"

It is one who has not uttered the two testimonies, lacks\nthe correct Islamic faith (\nimaan\n), or holds a belief, says a word, or\ndoes an act of disbelief.\nThere is an important point to be understood here.  If a\nperson who becomes a Muslim by uttering the Testimony of Faith (\nshahadah\n)\nholds a belief, says, or does what is considered\nkufr\n, he may not necessarily\nbecome a disbeliever.  The reason is that after becoming a Muslim, there are\ncertain obstacles that prevent a person from becoming a\nkafir\n.\nReasons That Prevent a Person from Becoming a Disbeliever\nA Muslim might fall into disbelief, but not become a disbeliever\ndue to one of the following reasons:\n[2]\n1.Ignorance\nA convert, a Muslim who grew up in a remote area, or a\nMuslim who was raised in an irreligious environment may be ignorant of the\nbasic beliefs, religious duties, and prohibitions of Islam.  Such a person may\nnot know, for example, that Islam prohibits homosexuality or requires prayers\nfive times a day.  These people may fall into disbelief, but will not become disbelievers\nbecause in the sight of Allah they may be excused due to their ignorance.\n2.Mistake\nA person may miss the mark and do something he never\nintended.  He may simply make an unintentional, honest mistake.  For example,\nif a convert to Islam believes that consuming alcohol is only forbidden at\nprayer times. From a textual perspective, consuming alcohol, while believing it\nto be lawful, is an act of disbelief, but this person would not become a\ndisbeliever because of the honest mistake h"

Otherwise, we do not consider\npeople to become non-Muslims on account of a sin they commit.\nThe proof that a person who commits a sin is considered\nMuslim is found in the Quran and Prophetic Traditions:\n1.The Quran says:\n“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up\nwith him in worship but He will forgive whoever He wishes for anything besides\nthat.” (Quran 4:48)\n2.Whoever dies without committing\nshirk\nwith Allah shall\nenter Paradise.\n[2]\n3.A person who believes in\nTawheed\nwill enter Paradise even\nif he fornicates and steals.\n[3]\nThere was an alcoholic in the time of the Prophet.  One\ntime when he was punished, a Muslim cursed him.  The Prophet forbade that Muslim\nfrom cursing that Companion and he said: ‘Do not curse him, for by Allah, he\nloves Allah and His Messenger.’\n[4]\nDue to his belief in Allah and His Prophet, the major sin that he was doing did\nnot wipe out all his faith.\nHow Are Major Sins Forgiven?\nMajor sin can be forgiven by the following ways:\na)    Through sincere repentance, which entails\nleaving the sin, having remorse for performing it, and resolving to never\nperform it again.  If the sin involves wrongdoing towards others, then in\naddition to the above, he must also restore their rights or property or seek\ntheir forgiveness.\nWhen Allah sees this\nsincere repentance from one of His slaves – a slave who truly turns to his Lord\nin fear and hope – He not only\nforgives\nthe sin, but\nreplaces\nthose sins for good deeds to the slave’s credit.  This is from Allah’s infinite\ngrace and mercy.  Allah says this right after mentioning the sins of\nshirk\n,\nmurder, and adultery, He says: “Except those who repent and believe, and do\nrighteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and\nAllah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Quran 25:70)  This blessing is only\nfor one who has faith, whose repentance is sincere, and who strives to work\nrighteous deeds.\nb)   By Allah’s pure grace, generosity, and favor. \nAllah may therefore forgive whomsoever He wills without that individual having\nactually repented.\nc)    By the performance of certain acts, like\nHajj\n,\naccording to some scholars.\nFate of a Person Who Dies Committing Major Sins\nA person who dies from an unrepented major sin is at\nAllah’s discretion in the Hereafter.  If Allah wants, He may punish him first acc"

Despair not of the mercy of Allah, indeed, Allah forgives\nall sins.  Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’” (Quran 39:53)\n“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and\nforgives sins” (Quran 42:25)\n2.  Praying for forgiveness\nAsking for forgiveness is not tied to strict conditions\nlike repentance.  It is simply a prayer that Allah may or may not accept.  The\nProphet said:\n“If a person commits a sin, then says, ‘O Lord, I have\ncommitted a sin so forgive me,’ He says, ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who\nmay forgive sins or punish for it; I have forgiven My slave…’”\n[1]\n3.  Doing good deeds which wipe out sins\nAllah says:\n“Indeed, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.” (Quran 11:114)\n·Daily Prayers and Friday Prayer\n“Each of the five daily prayers and from one Friday\nprayer to the next is an expiation for the time in between, so long as one does\nnot commit any major sin.”\n[2]\n·Ablution\n“When a Muslim, or a believer, washes his face (in\nthe course of ablution), every sin which he committed with his eyes, will be\nwashed away from his face with water, or with the last drop of water; when he\nwashes his hands, every sin which is committed by his hands will be effaced\nfrom his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when he\nwashes his feet, every sin his feet committed will be washed away with the\nwater, or with the last drop of water; until he finally emerges cleansed of all\nhis sins.”\n[3]\n·Fasting\nRamadan\n“Whoever fasts\nRamadan\nout of faith and the\nhope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.”\n[4]\n“Whoever spends the night of\nLaylat al-Qadr\nin prayer out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be\nforgiven.”\n[5]\n·\nHajj\n“Whoever performs Pilgrimage to this House, and\ndoes not engage in sexual relations with his wife during it and does not engage\nin sinful behavior will go back free of sin like the day his mother gave birth\nto him.”\n[6]\nRighteous deeds such as prayer, fasting,\nHajj\n,\netc only expiate for transgressions against the rights of Allah.  With regard\nto sins that have to do with the rights of other people, one has to repent from\nthem.\n4.  Prayers of fellow believers such as the funeral prayer\nThe Messenger of Allah said:\n“There is no Muslim man\nwho dies, and forty men pray the funeral prayer for him, not associating\nanything with Allah, but Allah will accept their intercession for him.”\n[7]\nAngels also pray for the believer:\n“Those who bear the Throne, and those who are around it,\nglorify their Lord with His praise, and believe in Him.  They ask forgiveness\nfor those who believe, saying, Our Lord, You embrace all things in mercy and\nknowledge.  Forgive those who turn to You and follow Your path.  Save them from\nthe punishment of Hell.” (Quran 40:7)\n5.  Intercession of the Prophet on the Day of Resurrection\nThe Prophet said:\n“My intercession will be for those among my\nummah\nwho committed major sins.”\n[8]\nAnd he said:\n“I was given the choice between admitting half of\nmy\nummah\nto Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession.”\n[9]\n6.  Allah wipes out sins by calamities of this world\nThe Prophet said:\n“No tiredness, exhaustion, worry,\ngrief, distress or harm befalls a believer in this world, not even a thorn that\npricks him, but Allah expiates some of his sins thereby.”\n[10]\n7.  The torment, squeezing, and terror of the grave will also\nexpiate sins.\n8.  Undergoing the horrors, distress and hardship of the Day\nof Resurrection will expiate some sins.\n9.  Mercy of the Most Merciful\nBy the mercy of Allah, with no cause on the part of\nHis slaves, many will be forgiven.\n[11]\nUnforgivable Sin\nIf a person dies as a\nkafir\nhe will not be\nforgiven."
