    "content": "In the early 7\nth\ncentury, the two most\npowerful empires at the time were the Byzantine\n[1]\nand Persian Empires.  In the years 613 - 614 C.E the two Empires went to war, with the Byzantines suffering a severe defeat at the hands of the Persians.  Damascus and Jerusalem both fell to the Persian Empire.  In the chapter,\nThe Romans\n,\nin the Holy Quran, it is stated that the\nByzantines\nhad met with a great defeat but would soon gain victory\n:\n“The Romans have been defeated in the lowest land, but after their\ndefeat they will soon be victorious.  Within three to nine years.  The decision\nof the matter, before and after, is with God.” (Quran 30:2-4)\nThese verses, above,  were revealed around 620 C.E, almost 7 years after the severe defeat of the Christian Byzantines at the hands of the idolater\nPersians in 613 – 614 C.E.  Yet it was related in the verses that the\nByzantines would shortly be victorious.  In-fact, Byzantine had been so heavily\ndefeated that it seemed impossible for the Empire to even maintain its very existence,\nlet alone be victorious again.\nNot only the Persians, but also the Avars, Slavs and Lombards\n(located to the North and West of the Byzantine Empire) posed serious threats\nto the Byzantine Empire’s sovereignty.  The Avars had come as far as the walls\nof Constantinople and  had nearly captured the Emperor, himself.  Many governors\nhad revolted against Emperor Heraclius, and the Empire was\non the point of collapse.  Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Armenia, which had earlier  belonged to the Byzantine Empire, were invaded by the\nPersians.  In short, everyone was expecting the Byzantine Empire to be\ndestroyed, but right at that moment the first verses of the chapter, The Romans,\nwere revealed announcing that the Byzantines would regain triumph in a few\nyears time. Shortly after this revelation, the Byzantine Emperor proceeded to order\nthe gold and silver in churches to be melted and turned into money in order\nboth to meet the demanding expenses of the army, and finance his drive to regain\nthe lost territories.\nAround 7 years after the revelation of the first verses\nof\nThe Romans\n, in December, 627 C.E, a decisive battle between The Byzantine\nEmpire and the Persian Empire was fought inthe area around the Dead Sea,\n[2]\nand this time it was the Byzantine army which surprisingly defeated the\nPersians.  A few months later, the Persians had to make an agreement with the Byzantines\nwhich obliged them to return the territories they had taken from them.  So, in\nthe end, the victory of the Romans proclaimed by God in the Quran miraculously\ncame through.\nAnother miracle revealed in the mentioned verses is the\nannouncement of a geographical fact that  no-one would have been able to\ndiscover in that period.  In the third verse of\nThe Romans\n, it was\nmentioned that the Romans were defeated\n“in the lowest land” (Quran 30:3)\n. \nSignificantly, the places where the main battles took place (in Damascus and Jerusalem) lie in a vast area of low-lying land called the Great Rift Valley.\n The Great Rift Valley is a huge 5,000 km fault line in the earth’s crust that\nruns from northern Syria in the Middle-East of Asia to central Mozambique in East Africa.  The northernmost extension runs through Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordon.  The rift then extends south to the Gulf of Aden, makes its way\nthrough East Africa, then finally ends at the lower Zambezi River valley in   Mozambique.\nAn interesting fact that has been discovered recently,\nwith the help of satellite images, is that the area around the Dead Sea (located\nin the Great Rift Valley) has the lowest altitude on Earth. In fact, the lowest\npoint on Earth is the shoreline of the Dead Sea, with an altitude of around 400\nmeters\n[3]\nbelow sea level.  The fact that it lies at the\nlowest point means that water does not drain from the sea.  No land point on earth\nhas a lower altitude than the shoreline of the Dead Sea.\n[4]\nDead Sea Rift Valley, Israel and Jordan October 1984.  Seen\nfrom an altitude of 190 nautical miles (350 kilometers) in this near-vertical\nphotograph, the Dead Sea Rift Valley slices south-north through the Middle East. The surface of the Dead Sea, 1292 feet (394 meters) below sea level, is the\nlowest point on Earth. (Courtesy: The Image Science & Analysis Laboratory, NASA Johnson  Space Center, Photo #: STS41G-120-56, http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov)\nTherefore it becomes clear that the country or\nprefecture which occupies the rift valley in the vicinity of the Dead Sea is what is meant in the Quran by\n“the lowest land.”\nThis is a true miracle\nof the Quran because no-one could have known or foreseen such a fact in the 7th\ncentury due to the fact that satellites and modern day technology were not\navailable at the time.  Once again, the only possible explanation is that\nProphet Muhammad had truly received divine revelation from God, The Creator and\nOriginator of the universe.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe Arabs also\nrefer to the Byzantines as the Romans.\n[2]\nThe History of Persia Part I: Ancient Persia\nby Scott Peoples\n[3]\n(http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/SanjeevMenon.shtml)\n[4]\n(http://www.elnaggarzr.com/index.php?l=ar&id=51&cat=6)",

    "content": "By the sky which\nreturns\n. (Quran 86:11)\n[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the\nsky a\nceiling\n… (Quran 2:22)\nIn the first verse God swears by the sky\n[1]\nand its function of ‘returning’ without specifying what it ‘returns.’  In\nIslamic doctrine, a divine oath signifies the magnitude of importance of a\nspecial relation to the Creator, and manifests His majesty and the supreme\nTruth in a special way.\nThe second verse describes the Divine Act that made the\nsky a ‘ceiling’ for the dwellers of earth.\nLet us see what modern atmospheric science has to say\nabout the role and function of the sky.\nThe atmosphere is a word which denotes all the air\nsurrounding the earth, from the ground all the way up to the edge from which space\nstarts.  The atmosphere is composed of several layers, each defined because of\nthe various phenomena which occur within the layer.\nThis image shows the average temperature profile through the\nEarth’s atmosphere.  Temperatures in the thermosphere are very sensitive to\nsolar activity and can vary from 500°C to 1500°C.  Source: Windows to the\nUniverse, (http://www.windows.ucar.edu), the University Corporation for\nAtmospheric Research (UCAR).  ©1995-1999, 2000 The Regents of the University of Michigan; ©2000-04 University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.\nRain, for one, is ‘returned’ to Earth by the clouds in\nthe atmosphere.  Explaining the hydrologic cycle, Encyclopedia Britannica\nwrites:\nWater evaporates from both the aquatic and terrestrial\nenvironments as it is heated by the Sun’s energy.  The rates of evaporation and\nprecipitation depend on solar energy, as do the patterns of circulation of\nmoisture in the air and currents in the ocean.  Evaporation exceeds\nprecipitation over the oceans, and this water vapor is transported by the wind\nover land, where it returns to the land through precipitation.\n[2]\nNot only does the atmosphere return what was on the\nsurface back to the surface, but it reflects back into space that which might\ndamage the flora and fauna the earth sustains, such as excessive radiant heat. \nIn the 1990’s, collaborations between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA),\nand the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) of Japan resulted\nin the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) Science Initiative.  Polar,\nWind and Geotail are a part of this initiative, combining resources and\nscientific communities to obtain coordinated, simultaneous investigations of\nthe Sun-Earth space environment over an extended period of time.  They have an\nexcellent explanation of how the atmosphere returns solar heat to space.\n[3]\nBesides ‘returning’ rain, heat and radio waves, the\natmosphere protects us like a ceiling above our heads by filtering out deadly cosmic\nrays, powerful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun, and even meteorites on\ncollision course with Earth.\n[4]\nPennsylvania State Public Broadcasting tells us:\nThe sunlight that we can see represents one group of\nwavelengths, visible light.  Other wavelengths emitted by the sun include\nx-rays and ultraviolet radiation.  X-rays and some ultraviolet light waves are\nabsorbed high in Earth’s atmosphere.  They heat the thin layer of gas there to\nvery high temperatures.  Ultraviolet light waves are the rays that can cause\nsunburn.  Most ultraviolet light waves are absorbed by a thicker layer of gas\ncloser to Earth called the ozone layer.  By soaking up the deadly ultraviolet\nand x-rays, the atmosphere acts as a protective shield around the planet.  Like\na giant thermal blanket, the atmosphere also keeps temperatures from getting\ntoo hot or too cold.  In addition, the atmosphere also protects us from\nconstant bombardment by meteoroids, bits of rock and dust that travel at high\nspeeds throughout the solar system.  The falling stars we see at night are not\nstars at all; they are actually meteoroids burning up in our atmosphere due to\nthe extreme heating they undergo.\n[5]\nThis is an image of\nEarth’s polar stratospheric clouds.  These clouds are involved in the creation\nof Earth’s ozone hole.  Source: Windows to the Universe, (http://www.windows.ucar.edu/)\nat the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).  ©1995-1999,\n2000 The Regents of the University of Michigan; ©2000-04 University Corporation\nfor Atmospheric Research.\nEncyclopedia Britannica, describing the role of\nStratosphere, tells us about its protective role in absorbing dangerous\nultraviolet radiation:\nIn the upper stratospheric regions, absorption of\nultraviolet light from the Sun breaks down oxygen molecules; recombination of\noxygen atoms with O2 molecules into ozone (O3) creates the ozone layer, which\nshields the lower ecosphere from harmful short-wavelength radiation…More\ndisturbing, however, is the discovery of a growing depletion of ozone over\ntemperate latitudes, where a large percentage of the world’s population\nresides, since the ozone layer serves as a shield against ultraviolet\nradiation, which has been found to cause skin cancer.\n[6]\nThe mesosphere is the layer in which many meteors burn\nup while entering the Earth’s atmosphere.  Imagine a baseball zipping along at\n30,000 miles per hour.  That’s how big and fast many meteors are.  When they\nplow through the atmosphere, meteors are heated to more than 3000 degrees\nFahrenheit, and they glow.  A meteor compresses air in front of it.  The air\nheats up, in turn heating the meteor.\n[7]\nThis is an image which shows the Earth and its atmosphere.  The\nmesosphere would be the dark blue edge located on the far top of the image underneath\nthe black.\n(Image courtesy of NASA)\nEarth is surrounded by a magnetic force field - a bubble\nin space called the magnetosphere tens of thousands of miles wide.  The\nmagnetosphere acts as a shield that protects us from solar storms.  However, according\nto new observations from NASA’s IMAGE spacecraft and the joint NASA/European\nSpace Agency Cluster satellites, immense cracks sometimes develop in Earth’s\nmagnetosphere and remain open for hours.  This allows the solar wind to gush\nthrough and power stormy space weather.  Fortunately, these cracks do not expose\nEarth’s surface to the solar wind.  Our atmosphere protects us, even when our\nmagnetic field does not.\n[8]\nAn artist’s\nrendition of NASA’s IMAGE satellite flying through a ‘crack’ in Earth’s\nmagnetic field.\nHow would it be possible for a seventh century desert\ndweller to describe the sky in a manner so precise that only recent scientific\ndiscoveries have confirmed it?  The only way is if he received revelation from\nthe Creator of the sky.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nAl-Samaa’, the Arabic word translated here as ‘sky’\nincludes earth’s atmosphere as indicated by the verse 2:164.\n[2]\nBiosphere.

    "excerpt": "The miracle of embryonic development is\nmentioned in the Quran in such minute detail, much of which was unknown to\nscientists until only recently.  It mentions the first stages of life after\nconception, the second stage of life after conception, and witnesses of\nscientists about these scientific facts of the Quran.",

    "content": "In the Holy Quran, God speaks about the stages of man’s\nembryonic development:\nWe created man from an extract of clay. \nThen We made him as a drop in a place of settlement, firmly fixed.  Then We\nmade the drop into an\nalaqah\n(leech, suspended thing, and blood clot),\nthen We made the\nalaqah\ninto a\nmudghah\n(chewed substance)… (Quran\n23:12-14)\nLiterally, the Arabic word\nalaqah\nhas\nthree meanings: (1) leech, (2) suspended thing, and (3) blood clot.\nIn comparing a leech to an embryo in the\nalaqah\nstage, we find similarity between the two\n[1]\nas we can see in figure 1.  Also, the embryo at this stage obtains nourishment\nfrom the blood of the mother, similar to the leech, which feeds on the blood of\nothers.\n[2]\nFigure 1: Drawings illustrating the similarities in\nappearance between a leech and a human embryo at the\nalaqah\nstage.\n(Leech drawing from Human Development as Described in the Quran and Sunnah,\nMoore and others, p. 37, modified from Integrated Principles of Zoology,\nHickman and others.  Embryo drawing from The Developing Human, Moore and\nPersaud, 5th ed., p. 73.)\nThe second meaning of the word\nalaqah\nis\nsuspended thing.  This is what we can see in figures 2 and 3, the suspension\nof the embryo, during the\nalaqah\nstage, in the womb of the mother.\nFigure 2: We can see in this diagram the suspension\nof an embryo during the\nalaqah\nstage in the womb (uterus) of the mother.\n(The Developing Human, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed., p. 66.)\nFigure 3: In this photomicrograph, we can see the\nsuspension of an embryo (marked B) during the\nalaqah\nstage (about 15\ndays old) in the womb of the mother.  The actual size of the embryo is about\n0.6 mm. (The Developing Human, Moore, 3rd ed., p. 66, from Histology, Leeson\nand Leeson.)\nThe third meaning of the word\nalaqah\nis\nblood clot.  We find that the external appearance of the embryo and its sacs\nduring the\nalaqah\nstage is similar to that of a blood clot.  This is due\nto the presence of relatively large amounts of blood present in the embryo\nduring this stage\n[3]\n(see\nfigure 4).  Also during this stage, the blood in the embryo does not circulate\nuntil the end of the third week.\n[4]\nThus, the embryo at this stage is like a clot of blood.\nFigure 4: Diagram of the primitive cardiovascular\nsystem in an embryo during the\nalaqah\nstage.  The external appearance of\nthe embryo and its sacs is similar to that of a blood clot, due to the presence\nof relatively large amounts of blood present in the embryo. (The Developing\nHuman, Moore, 5th ed., p. 65.)\nSo the three meanings of the word\nalaqah\ncorrespond accurately to the descriptions of the embryo at the\nalaqah\nstage.\nThe next stage mentioned in the verse is the\nmudghah stage.  The Arabic word mudghah means chewed substance.  If one were\nto take a piece of gum and chew it in his or her mouth and then compare it with\nan embryo at the mudghah stage, we would conclude that the embryo at the\nmudghah stage acquires the appearance of a chewed substance.  This is because\nof the somites at the back of the embryo that somewhat resemble teethmarks in\na chewed substance.\n[5]\n(see\nfigures 5 and 6).\nFigure 5: Photograph of an embryo at the mudghah\nstage (28 days old).  The embryo at this stage acquires the appearance of a\nchewed substance, because the somites at the back of the embryo somewhat\nresemble teeth marks in a chewed substance.  The actual size of the embryo is 4\nmm. (The Developing Human, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed., p. 82, from Professor\nHideo Nishimura, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.)\nFigure 6: When comparing the appearance of an embryo\nat the mudghah stage with a piece of gum that has been chewed, we find\nsimilarity between the two.\nA)        Drawing\nof an embryo at the mudghah stage.  We can see here the somites at the back of\nthe embryo that look like teeth marks. (The Developing Human, Moore and\nPersaud, 5th ed., p. 79.)\nB)        Photograph of a piece of gum that has been\nchewed.\nHow could Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings\nof God be upon him, have possibly known all this 1400 years ago, when\nscientists have only recently discovered this using advanced equipment and\npowerful microscopes which did not exist at that time?  Hamm and Leeuwenhoek\nwere the first scientists to observe human sperm cells (spermatozoa) using an\nimproved microscope in 1677 (more than 1000 years after Muhammad).  They\nmistakenly thought that the sperm cell contained a miniature preformed human\nbeing that grew when it was deposited in the female genital tract.\n[6]\nProfessor Emeritus Keith L. Moore\n[7]\nis one of the world’s most prominent scientists in the fields of anatomy and\nembryology and is the author of the book entitled The Developing Human, which\nhas been translated into eight languages.  This book is a scientific reference\nwork and was chosen by a special committee in the United States as the best\nbook authored by one person.  Dr. Keith Moore is Professor Emeritus of Anatomy\nand Cell Biology at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.  There, he was Associate Dean of Basic Sciences at the Faculty of Medicine and for 8 years\nwas the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy.  In 1984, he received the most\ndistinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists.  He has\ndirected many international associations, such as the Canadian and American\nAssociation of Anatomists and the Council of the Union of Biological Sciences.\nIn 1981, during the Seventh Medical Conference\nin Dammam, Saudi Arabia, Professor Moore said: It has been a great pleasure\nfor me to help clarify statements in the Quran about human development.  It is\nclear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from God, because\nalmost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later. \nThis proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of God.\n[8]\n(\nTo\nview the RealPlayer video of this comment click here\n).\nConsequently, Professor Moore was asked the\nfollowing question: Does this mean that you believe that the Quran is the word\nof God?  He replied: I find no difficulty in accepting this.\n[9]\nDuring one conference, Professor Moore stated:\n....Because the staging of human embryos is complex, owing to the continuous\nprocess of change during development, it is proposed that a new system of\nclassification could be developed using the terms mentioned in the Quran and\nSunnah (what Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, said,\ndid, or approved of).  The proposed system is simple, comprehensive, and\nconforms with present embryological knowledge.  The intensive studies of the\nQuran and hadeeth (reliably transmitted reports by the Prophet Muhammad’s\ncompanions of what he said, did, or approved of) in the last four years have\nrevealed a system for classifying human embryos that is amazing since it was\nrecorded in the seventh century A.D.  Although Aristotle, the founder of the science\nof embryology, realized that chick embryos developed in stages from his studies\nof hen’s eggs in the fourth century B.C., he did not give any details about\nthese stages.  As far as it is known from the history of embryology, little was\nknown about the staging and classification of human embryos until the twentieth\ncentury.  For this reason, the descriptions of the human embryo in the Quran\ncannot be based on scientific knowledge in the seventh century.  The only\nreasonable conclusion is: these descriptions were revealed to Muhammad from\nGod.  He could not have known such details because he was an illiterate man\nwith absolutely no scientific training.\n[10]\n(\nView\nthe RealPlayer video of this comment\n).\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe Developing Human\n, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed.,\np. 8.\n[2]\nHuman Development as Described in the Quran and\nSunnah\n, Moore and others, p. 36.\n[3]\nHuman Development as Described in the Quran and\nSunnah\n, Moore and others, pp. 37-38.\n[4]\nThe Developing Human\n, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed.,\np. 65.\n[5]\nThe Developing Human\n, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed.,\np. 8.\n[6]\nThe Developing Human\n, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed.,\np. 9.\n[7]\nNote: The occupations of all the scientists mentioned in\nthis web site were last updated in 1997.\n[8]\nThe reference for this saying is\nThis is the Truth\n(videotape). \nFor a copy of this videotape, please visit\nwww.islam-guide.com/truth.htm\n[9]\nThis is the Truth\n(videotape).\n[10]\nThis is the Truth\n(videotape).  For a copy, see\nfootnote no. 9.",

    "content": "A\nbook entitled Earth is a basic reference textbook in many universities around\nthe world.  One of its two authors is Professor Emeritus Frank Press.  He was\nthe Science Advisor to former US President Jimmy Carter, and for 12 years was\nthe President of the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC. His book\nsays that mountains have underlying roots.\n[1]\nThese roots are deeply embedded in the ground, thus, mountains have a shape\nlike a peg (see figures 1, 2, and 3).\nFigure 1: Mountains have deep roots under the\nsurface of the ground. (Earth, Press and Siever, p. 413.)\nFigure 2: Schematic section.  The mountains, like\npegs, have deep roots embedded in the ground. (Anatomy of the Earth, Cailleux,\np. 220.)\nFigure 3: Another illustration shows how the\nmountains are peg-like in shape, due to their deep roots. (Earth Science,\nTarbuck and Lutgens, p. 158.)\nThis is how the Quran has described mountains. \nGod has said in the Quran:\n“Have We not made the earth as a bed, and\nthe mountains as pegs?” (Quran 78:6-7)\nModern earth sciences have proven that mountains\nhave deep roots under the surface of the ground (see figure 3) and that these\nroots can reach several times their elevations above the surface of the ground.\n[2]\nSo the most suitable word to describe mountains on the basis of this\ninformation is the word ‘peg,’ since most of a properly set peg is hidden under\nthe surface of the ground.  The history of science tells us that the theory of\nmountains having deep roots was introduced only in the latter half of the\nnineteenth century.\n[3]\nMountains also play an important role in\nstabilizing the crust of the earth.\n[4]\nThey hinder\nthe shaking of the earth.  God has said in the Quran:\n“And He has set firm mountains in the earth\nso that it would not shake with you...” (Quran 16:15)\nLikewise, the modern theory of plate tectonics\nholds that mountains work as stabilizers for the earth.  This knowledge about\nthe role of mountains as stabilizers for the earth has just begun to be\nunderstood in the framework of plate tectonics since the late 1960’s.\n[5]\nCould anyone during the time of the Prophet\nMuhammad have known of the true shape of mountains?\nCould\nanyone imagine that the solid massive mountain which he sees before him\nactually extends deep into the earth and has a root, as scientists assert?  A\nlarge number of books of geology, when discussing mountains, only describe that\npart which is above the surface of the earth.  This is because these books were\nnot written by specialists in geology.  However, modern geology has confirmed\nthe truth of the Quranic verses.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nEarth\n, Press and Siever, p. 435.

    "content": "The science of modern cosmology, observational and\ntheoretical, clearly indicates that, at one point in time, the whole universe\nwas nothing but a cloud of ‘smoke’ (i.e. an opaque highly dense and hot gaseous\ncomposition).\n[1]\nThis is one\nof the undisputed principles of standard modern cosmology.  Scientists now can\nobserve new stars forming out of the remnants of that ‘smoke’ (see figures 1\nand 2).\nFigure 1: A new star forming out of a cloud of gas\nand dust (nebula), which is one of the remnants of the ‘smoke’ that was the\norigin of the whole universe. (The Space Atlas, Heather and Henbest, p. 50.)\nFigure 2: The Lagoon nebula is a cloud of gas and\ndust, about 60 light years in diameter.  It is excited by the ultraviolet\nradiation of the hot stars that have recently formed within its bulk.\n(Horizons, Exploring the Universe, Seeds, plate 9, from Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.)\nThe illuminating stars we see at night were,\njust as was the whole universe, in that ‘smoke’ material.  God has said in the\nQuran:\n“Then He\nturned to the heaven when it was smoke...” (Quran 41:11)\nBecause the earth and the heavens above (the\nsun, the moon, stars, planets, galaxies, etc.) have been formed from this same\n‘smoke,’ we conclude that the earth and the heavens were one connected entity. \nThen out of this homogeneous ‘smoke,’ they formed and separated from each\nother. God has said in the Quran:\n“Have not\nthose who disbelieved known that the heavens and the earth were one connected\nentity, then We separated them?...” (Quran 21:30)\nDr. Alfred Kroner is one of the world’s renowned\ngeologists.  He is Professor of Geology and the Chairman of the Department of\nGeology at the Institute of Geosciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.  He said: “Thinking where Muhammad came from . . . I think it is\nalmost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin\nof the universe, because scientists have only found out within the last few\nyears, with very complicated and advanced technological methods, that this is\nthe case.”\n[2]\n(\nTo view the RealPlayer\nvideo of this comment click here\n).  Also he said: “Somebody who did not\nknow something about nuclear physics fourteen hundred years ago could not, I\nthink, be in a position to find out from his own mind, for instance, that the\nearth and the heavens had the same origin.”\n[3]\n(\nView the RealPlayer\nvideo of this comment\n).\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe First Three Minutes, a Modern View of the Origin\nof the Universe\n, Weinberg, pp. 94-105.\n[2]\nThe reference for this saying is\nThis is the Truth\n(videotape).  For a copy of this videotape, please visit\nthis page\n.\n[3]\nThis is the Truth\n(videotape).",

    "content": "God has said in the Quran:\n“Or (the unbelievers’ state) is like the\ndarkness in a deep sea.  It is covered by waves, above which are waves, above\nwhich are clouds.  Darknesses, one above another.  If a man stretches out his\nhand, he cannot see it....” (Quran 24:40)\nThis verse mentions the darkness found in deep seas and\noceans, where if a man stretches out his hand, he cannot see it.  The darkness\nin deep seas and oceans is found around a depth of 200 meters and below.  At\nthis depth, there is almost no light (see figure 1).  Below a depth of 1000\nmeters there is no light at all.\n[1]\nHuman\nbeings are not able to dive more than forty meters without the aid of\nsubmarines or special equipment.  Human beings cannot survive unaided in the\ndeep dark part of the oceans, such as at a depth of 200 meters.\nFigure 1: Between 3 and 30 percent of the sunlight\nis reflected at the sea surface.  Then almost all of the seven colors of the\nlight spectrum are absorbed one after another in the first 200 meters, except\nthe blue light. (\nOceans\n, Elder and Pernetta, p. 27.)\nScientists have recently discovered this\ndarkness by means of special equipment and submarines that have enabled them to\ndive into the depths of the oceans.\nWe can also understand from the following\nsentences in the previous verse,\n“...in a deep sea.  It is covered by waves,\nabove which are waves, above which are clouds....”\n, that the deep waters of\nseas and oceans are covered by waves, and above these waves are other waves. \nIt is clear that the second set of waves are the surface waves that we see,\nbecause the verse mentions that above the second waves there are clouds.  But\nwhat about the first waves?  Scientists have recently discovered that there are\ninternal waves which “occur on density interfaces between layers of different\ndensities.”\n[2]\n(see figure 2).\nFigure 2: Internal waves at interface between two\nlayers of water of different densities.  One is dense (the lower one), the\nother one is less dense (the upper one). (\nOceanography\n, Gross, p. 204.)\nThe internal waves cover the deep waters of\nseas and oceans because the deep waters have a higher density than the waters\nabove them.  Internal waves act like surface waves.  They can also break, just\nlike surface waves.  Internal waves cannot be seen by the human eye, but they\ncan be detected by studying temperature or salinity changes at a given\nlocation.\n[3]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nOceans\n, Elder and Pernetta, p. 27.\n[2]\nOceanography\n, Gross, p. 205.\n[3]\nOceanography\n, Gross, p. 205.",

    "content": "Modern Science has discovered that in the places where two different\nseas meet, there is a barrier between them.  This barrier divides the two seas\nso that each sea has its own temperature, salinity, and density.\n[1]\nFor example, Mediterranean sea water is warm, saline, and less dense, compared\nto Atlantic ocean water.  When Mediterranean sea water enters the Atlantic over\nthe Gibraltar sill, it moves several hundred kilometers into the Atlantic at a depth of about 1000 meters with its own warm, saline, and less dense\ncharacteristics.  The Mediterranean water stabilizes at this depth\n[2]\n(see figure 1).\nFigure 1: The Mediterranean sea water as it enters\nthe Atlantic over the Gibraltar sill with its own warm, saline, and less dense\ncharacteristics, because of the barrier that distinguishes between them. \nTemperatures are in degrees Celsius (C°). (Marine Geology, Kuenen, p. 43, with\na slight enhancement.)\nAlthough there are large waves, strong currents,\nand tides in these seas, they do not mix or transgress this barrier.\nThe Holy Quran mentioned that there is a barrier\nbetween two seas that meet and that they do not transgress.  God has said:\n“He has set\nfree the two seas meeting together.  There is a barrier between them.  They do\nnot transgress.” (Quran 55:19-20)\nBut when the Quran speaks about the divider\nbetween fresh and salt water, it mentions the existence of “a forbidding\npartition” with the barrier.  God has said in the Quran:\n“He is the\none who has set free the two kinds of water, one sweet and palatable, and the\nother salty and bitter.  And He has made between them a barrier and a\nforbidding partition.” (Quran 25:53)\nOne may ask, why did the Quran mention the\npartition when speaking about the divider between fresh and salt water, but did\nnot mention it when speaking about the divider between the two seas?\nModern science has discovered that in estuaries,\nwhere fresh (sweet) and salt water meet, the situation is somewhat different\nfrom what is found in places where two seas meet.  It has been discovered that\nwhat distinguishes fresh water from salt water in estuaries is a “pycnocline\nzone with a marked density discontinuity separating the two layers.”\n[3]\nThis partition (zone of separation) has a different salinity from the fresh\nwater and from the salt water\n[4]\n(see figure\n2).\nFigure 2: Longitudinal section showing salinity\n(parts per thousand ‰) in an estuary.  We can see here the partition (zone of\nseparation) between the fresh and the salt water. (\nIntroductory Oceanography\n,\nThurman, p. 301, with a slight enhancement.)\nThis information has been discovered only\nrecently, using advanced equipment to measure temperature, salinity, density,\noxygen dissolubility, etc.  The human eye cannot see the difference between the\ntwo seas that meet, rather the two seas appear to us as one homogeneous sea. \nLikewise, the human eye cannot see the division of water in estuaries into the\nthree kinds: fresh water, salt water, and the partition (zone of separation).\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nPrinciples of Oceanography\n, Davis, pp. 92-93.\n[2]\nPrinciples of Oceanography\n, Davis, p. 93.\n[3]\nOceanography\n, Gross, p. 242.  Also see\nIntroductory\nOceanography\n, Thurman, pp. 300-301.\n[4]\nOceanography\n, Gross, p. 244, and Introductory\nOceanography, Thurman, pp. 300-301.",

    "content": "Scientists\nhave studied cloud types and have realized that rain clouds are formed and\nshaped according to definite systems and certain steps connected with certain\ntypes of wind and clouds.\nOne kind of rain cloud is the cumulonimbus\ncloud.  Meteorologists have studied how cumulonimbus clouds are formed and how\nthey produce rain, hail, and lightning.\nThey have found that cumulonimbus clouds go\nthrough the following steps to produce rain:\n1)\nThe\nclouds are pushed by the wind:\nCumulonimbus clouds begin to form\nwhen wind pushes some small pieces of clouds (cumulus clouds) to an area where\nthese clouds converge (see figures 1 and 2).\nFigure 1: Satellite photo showing the clouds moving\ntowards the convergence areas B, C, and D.  The arrows indicate the directions\nof the wind. (\nThe Use of Satellite Pictures in Weather Analysis and\nForecasting\n, Anderson and others, p. 188.)\nFigure 2: Small pieces of clouds (cumulus clouds)\nmoving towards a convergence zone near the horizon, where we can see a large\ncumulonimbus cloud. (\nClouds and Storms\n, Ludlam, plate 7.4.)\n2)\nJoining:\nThen the small clouds join together forming a larger cloud\n[1]\n(see figures 1 and 2).\nFigure 2: (A) Isolated small pieces of clouds\n(cumulus clouds).  (B) When the small clouds join together, updrafts within the\nlarger cloud increase, so the cloud is stacked up.  Water drops are indicated\nby ·. (\nThe Atmosphere\n, Anthes and others, p. 269.)\n3)\nStacking:\nWhen the small clouds join together, updrafts within the larger cloud\nincrease.  The updrafts near the center of the cloud are stronger than those\nnear the edges.\n[2]\nThese\nupdrafts cause the cloud body to grow vertically, so the cloud is stacked up\n(see figures 2 (B), 3, and 4).  This vertical growth causes the cloud body to\nstretch into cooler regions of the atmosphere, where drops of water and hail\nformulate and begin to grow larger and larger.  When these drops of water and\nhail become too heavy for the updrafts to support them, they begin to fall from\nthe cloud as rain, hail, etc.\n[3]\nFigure 3: A cumulonimbus cloud.  After the cloud is stacked\nup, rain comes out of it. (Weather and Climate, Bodin, p.123.)\nFigure 4: A cumulonimbus cloud. (\nA Colour Guide\nto Clouds\n, Scorer and Wexler, p. 23.)\nGod has said in the Quran:\n“Have you\nnot seen how God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then\nmakes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it....” (Quran\n24:43)\nMeteorologists have only recently come to know\nthese details of cloud formation, structure, and function by using advanced\nequipment like planes, satellites, computers, balloons, and other equipment, to\nstudy wind and its direction, to measure humidity and its variations, and to\ndetermine the levels and variations of atmospheric pressure.\n[4]\nThe preceding verse, after mentioning clouds and\nrain, speaks about hail and lightning:\n“....And He\nsends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it\nwhomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills. The vivid flash of its\nlightning nearly blinds the sight.” (Quran 24:43)\nMeteorologists have found that these\ncumulonimbus clouds, that shower hail, reach a height of 25,000 to 30,000 ft\n(4.7 to 5.7 miles),\n[5]\nlike\nmountains, as the Quran said,\n“...And He sends down hail from mountains\n(clouds) in the sky...”\n(see figure 4 above).\nThis verse may raise a question.  Why does the\nverse say\n“its lightning”\nin a reference to the hail?  Does this mean\nthat hail is the major factor in producing lightning?  Let us see what the book\nentitled\nMeteorology Today\nsays about this.  It says that a cloud\nbecomes electrified as hail falls through a region in the cloud of supercooled\ndroplets and ice crystals.\nAs\nliquid droplets collide with a hailstone, they freeze on contact and release\nlatent heat.  This keeps the surface of the hailstone warmer than that of the\nsurrounding ice crystals.  When the hailstone comes in contact with an ice\ncrystal, an important phenomenon occurs: electrons flow from the colder object\ntoward the warmer object.  Hence, the hailstone becomes negatively charged. \nThe same effect occurs when supercooled droplets come in contact with a\nhailstone and tiny splinters of positively charged ice break off.  These\nlighter positively charged particles are then carried to the upper part of the\ncloud by updrafts.  The hail, left with a negative charge, falls towards the\nbottom of the cloud, thus the lower part of the cloud becomes negatively\ncharged.  These negative charges are then discharged as lightning.\n[6]\nWe conclude from this that hail is the major factor in producing lightning.\nThis information on lightning was discovered\nrecently.  Until 1600 AD, Aristotle’s ideas on meteorology were dominant.  For\nexample, he said that the atmosphere contains two kinds of exhalation, moist\nand dry.  He also said that thunder is the sound of the collision of the dry\nexhalation with the neighboring clouds, and lightning is the inflaming and\nburning of the dry exhalation with a thin and faint fire.\n[7]\nThese are some of the ideas on meteorology that were dominant at the time of\nthe Quran’s revelation, fourteen centuries ago.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSee\nThe Atmosphere\n,\nAnthes and others, pp. 268-269, and\nElements of Meteorology\n, Miller and\nThompson, p. 141.\n[2]\nThe updrafts near the\ncenter are stronger, because they are protected from the cooling effects by the\nouter portion of the cloud.\n[3]\nSee\nThe Atmosphere\n,\nAnthes and others, p. 269, and\nElements of Meteorology\n, Miller and\nThompson, pp. 141-142.\n[4]\nSee\nEe\n’\njaz\nal-Quran al-Kareem fee Wasf Anwa\n’\nal-Riyah, al-Sohob, al-Matar\n,\nMakky and others, p. 55.\n[5]\nElements of\nMeteorology\n, Miller and Thompson, p. 141.\n[6]\nMeteorology Today\n,\nAhrens, p. 437.\n[7]\nThe Works of\nAristotle Translated into English: Meteorologica\n, vol. 3, Ross and others,\npp. 369a-369b.",

V. N. Persaud is Professor of\nAnatomy, Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, and Professor of Obstetrics,\nGynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.  There, he was the Chairman of the Department of Anatomy\nfor 16 years.  He is well-known in his field.  He is the author or editor of 22\ntextbooks and has published over 181 scientific papers.  In 1991, he received\nthe most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada, the J.C.B. Grant Award from the Canadian Association of Anatomists.  When he was\nasked about the scientific miracles in the Quran which he has researched, he\nstated the following:\n“The way it was\nexplained to me is that Muhammad was a very ordinary man.  He could not read,\ndidn’t know [how] to write. In fact, he was an illiterate.  And we’re talking\nabout twelve [actually about fourteen] hundred years ago.  You have someone\nilliterate making profound pronouncements and statements and that are amazingly\naccurate about scientific nature.  And I personally can’t see how this could be\na mere chance.  There are too many accuracies and, like Dr. Moore, I have no\ndifficulty in my mind that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led\nhim to these statements.”  (\nView\nthe RealPlayer video of this comment\n)\nProfessor\nPersaud has included some Quranic verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, may\nthe mercy and blessings of God be upon him, in some of his books.  He has also\npresented these verses and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad at several\nconferences.\n2)    Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson is the Chairman\nof the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Professor of Obstetrics and\nGynecology, and Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at the Baylor College\nof Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.  Formerly, he was Professor of Ob-Gyn and the\nChairman of the Department of Ob-Gyn at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.  He was also the President of the American Fertility Society.  He\nhas received many awards, including the Association of Professors of Obstetrics\nand Gynecology Public Recognition Award in 1992.  Professor Simpson studied the\nfollowing two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad:\n“In every one of you,\nall components of your creation are collected together in your mother’s womb by\nforty days...”\n[2]\n“If forty-two nights\nhave passed over the embryo, God sends an angel to it, who shapes it and\ncreates its hearing, vision, skin, flesh, and bones....”\n[3]\nHe studied\nthese two sayings of the Prophet Muhammad extensively, noting that the first\nforty days constitute a clearly distinguishable stage of embryo-genesis.  He\nwas particularly impressed by the absolute precision and accuracy of those sayings\nof the Prophet Muhammad.  Then, during one conference, he gave the following\nopinion:\n“So that the two\nhadeeths\n(the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad) that have been noted provide us with a\nspecific time table for the main embryological development before forty days. \nAgain, the point has been made, I think, repeatedly by other speakers this\nmorning: these\nhadeeths\ncould not have been obtained on the basis of the\nscientific knowledge that was available [at] the time of their writing . . . .\nIt follows, I think, that not only there is no conflict between genetics and\nreligion but, in fact, religion can guide science by adding revelation to some\nof the traditional scientific approaches, that there exist statements in the\nQuran shown centuries later to be valid, which support knowledge in the Quran having\nbeen derived from God.”  (\nView the RealPlayer\nvideo of this comment\n)\n3)    Dr. E. Marshall Johnson is Professor\nEmeritus of Anatomy and Developmental Biology at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.  There, for 22 years he was Professor of Anatomy,\nthe Chairman of the Department of Anatomy, and the Director of the Daniel Baugh\nInstitute.  He was also the President of the Teratology Society.  He has\nauthored more than 200 publications.  In 1981, during the Seventh Medical\nConference in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, Professor Johnson said in the presentation\nof his research paper:\n“Summary: The Quran\ndescribes not only the development of external form, but emphasizes also the internal\nstages, the stages inside the embryo, of its creation and development,\nemphasizing major events recognized by contemporary science.”  (\nView the RealPlayer\nvideo of this comment\n)\nAlso he said:\n“As a scientist, I can only deal with things which I can specifically see.  I\ncan understand embryology and developmental biology.  I can understand the\nwords that are translated to me from the Quran.  As I gave the example before,\nif I were to transpose myself into that era, knowing what I knew today and\ndescribing things, I could not describe the things which were described.  I see\nno evidence for the fact to refute the concept that this individual, Muhammad,\nhad to be developing this information from some place.  So I see nothing here\nin conflict with the concept that divine intervention was involved in what he\nwas able to write.”\n[4]\n(\nView\nthe RealPlayer video of this comment\n)\n4)    Dr. William W. Hay is a well-known\nmarine scientist.  He is Professor of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.  He was formerly the Dean of the Rosenstiel\nSchool of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.  After a discussion with Professor Hay about the Quran’s mention of\nrecently discovered facts on seas, he said:\n“I find it very\ninteresting that this sort of information is in the ancient scriptures of the\nHoly Quran, and I have no way of knowing where they would come from, but I\nthink it is extremely interesting that they are there and that this work is\ngoing on to discover it, the meaning of some of the passages.”  And when he was\nasked about the source of the Quran, he replied: “Well, I would think it must\nbe the divine being.”  (\nView the RealPlayer video of this comment\n)\n5)    Dr. Gerald C. Goeringer is Course\nDirector and Associate Professor of Medical Embryology at the Department of\nCell Biology, School of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.  During the Eighth Saudi Medical Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Professor\nGoeringer stated the following in the presentation of his research paper:\n“In a relatively few\naayahs\n(Quranic verses) is contained a rather comprehensive description of human\ndevelopment from the time of commingling of the gametes through organogenesis. \nNo such distinct and complete record of human development, such as\nclassification, terminology, and description, existed previously.  In most, if\nnot all, instances, this description antedates by many centuries the recording\nof the various stages of human embryonic and fetal development recorded in the\ntraditional scientific literature.”  (\nView\nthe RealPlayer video of this comment\n)\n6)    Dr. Yoshihide Kozai is Professor\nEmeritus at Tokyo University, Hongo, Tokyo, Japan, and was the Director of the National\nAstronomical Observatory, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan.  He said:\n“I am very much\nimpressed by finding true astronomical facts in [the] Quran, and for us the\nmodern astronomers have been studying very small pieces of the universe.  We’ve\nconcentrated our efforts for understanding of [a] very small part.  Because by\nusing telescopes, we can see only very few parts [of] the sky without thinking\n[about the] whole universe.  So, by reading [the] Quran and by answering to the\nquestions, I think I can find my future way for investigation of the\nuniverse.”  (\nView the RealPlayer video of this comment\n)\n7)    Professor Tejatat Tejasen is the\nChairman of the Department of Anatomy at Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai,   Thailand.  Previously, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the same\nuniversity.  During the Eighth Saudi Medical Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Professor Tejasen stood up and said:\n“During the last three\nyears, I became interested in the Quran . . . . From my study and what I have\nlearned from this conference, I believe that everything that has been recorded\nin the Quran fourteen hundred years ago must be the truth, that can be proved\nby the scientific means.  Since the Prophet Muhammad could neither read nor\nwrite, Muhammad must be a messenger who relayed this truth, which was revealed\nto him as an enlightenment by the one who is eligible [as the] creator.  This\ncreator must be God.  Therefore, I think this is the time to say\nLa ilaha\nilla Allah\n, there is no god to worship except Allah (God),\nMuhammadur\nrasoolu Allah\n, Muhammad is Messenger (Prophet) of Allah (God).  Lastly, I\nmust congratulate for the excellent and highly successful arrangement for this\nconference . . . . I have gained not only from the scientific point of view and\nreligious point of view but also the great chance of meeting many well-known\nscientists and making many new friends among the participants.  The most\nprecious thing of all that I have gained by coming to this place is\nLa ilaha\nilla Allah, Muhammadur rasoolu Allah\n, and to have become a Muslim.”  (\nView\nthe RealPlayer video of this comment\n)\nAfter all these\nexamples we have seen about the scientific miracles in the Holy Quran and all\nthese scientists’ comments on this, let us ask ourselves these questions:\n·\nCould it be a coincidence that all this recently\ndiscovered scientific information from different fields was mentioned in the\nQuran, which was revealed fourteen centuries ago?\n·\nCould this Quran have been authored by Muhammad, may\nthe mercy and blessings of God be upon him, or by any other human being?\nThe only possible answer is that this Quran must\nbe the literal word of God, revealed by Him.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nNote: The occupations of all the scientists mentioned in\nthis web site were last updated in 1997.\n[2]\nNarrated in\nSaheeh Muslim\n#2643, and\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n#3208.\nNote: What is between these special brackets {...} in this guide is a translation of what\nthe Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, said.  Also note that this symbol # used in\nthe footnotes, indicates the number of the\nhadeeth\n.  A\nhadeeth\nis\na reliably transmitted report by the Prophet Muhammad’s companions of what he\nsaid, did, or approved of.\n[3]\nNarrated in\nSaheeh Muslim\n#2645.\n[4]\nThe Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God\nbe upon him, was illiterate.  He could\nnot read nor write, but he dictated the Quran to his Companions and commanded\nsome of them to write it down.",

    "content": "Iron\nis one of the elements highlighted in the Quran. In the chapter known\nAl-Hadeed\n,\nmeaning Iron, we are informed:\n“And We also sent down iron in which there lies great force\nand which has many uses for mankind…” (Quran 57:25)\nThe word “\nanzalna\n,” translated as sent\ndown and used for iron in the verse, could be thought of having a metaphorical\nmeaning to explain that iron has been given to benefit people. But, when we\ntake into consideration the literal meaning of the word, which is, being\nphysically sent down from the sky, as this word usage had not been employed in\nthe Quran except literally, like the descending of the rain or revelation, we\nrealize that this verse implies a very significant scientific miracle. Because,\nmodern astronomical findings have disclosed that the iron found in our world\nhas come from giant stars in outer space.\n[1]\nNot only the iron on earth, but also the iron in the\nentire Solar System, comes from outer space, since the temperature in the Sun\nis inadequate for the formation of iron. The sun has a surface temperature of\n6,000 degrees Celsius, and a core temperature of approximately 20 million\ndegrees. Iron can only be produced in much larger stars than the Sun, where the\ntemperature reaches a few hundred million degrees. When the amount of iron\nexceeds a certain level in a star, the star can no longer accommodate it, and\nit eventually explodes in what is called a nova or a\nsupernova. These explosions make it possible for iron to be given\noff into space.\n[2]\nOne scientific source provides the following information\non this subject:\n“There is also evidence for older supernova events:\nEnhanced levels of iron-60 in deep-sea sediments have been interpreted as\nindications that a supernova explosion occurred within 90 light-years of the\nsun about 5 million years ago. Iron-60 is a radioactive isotope of iron, formed\nin supernova explosions, which decays with a half life of 1.5 million years. An\nenhanced presence of this isotope in a geologic layer indicates the recent\nnucleosynthesis of elements nearby in space and their subsequent transport to\nthe earth (perhaps as part of dust grains).”\n[3]\nAll this shows that iron did not form on the Earth, but\nwas carried from Supernovas, and was sent down, as stated in the\nverse. It is clear that this fact could not have been known in the 7\nth\ncentury, when the Quran was revealed. Nevertheless, this fact is related in the\nQuran, the Word of God, Who encompasses all things in His infinite knowledge.\nThe fact that the verse specifically mentions iron is\nquite astounding, considering that these discoveries were made at the end of\nthe 20th century. In his book Nature’s Destiny, the well-known microbiologist\nMichael Denton emphasizes the importance of iron:\n“Of all the metals there is none more essential to\nlife than iron. It is the accumulation of iron in the center of a star which\ntriggers a supernova explosion and the subsequent scattering of the vital atoms\nof life throughout the cosmos. It was the drawing by gravity of iron atoms to\nthe center of the primeval earth that generated the heat which caused the\ninitial chemical differentiation of the earth, the outgassing of the early\natmosphere, and ultimately the formation of the hydrosphere. It is molten iron\nin the center of the earth which, acting like a gigantic dynamo, generates the\nearth’s magnetic field, which in turn creates the Van Allen radiation belts\nthat shield the earth’s surface from destructive high-energy-penetrating cosmic\nradiation and preserve the crucial ozone layer from cosmic ray destruction…\n“Without the iron atom, there would be no carbon-based\nlife in the cosmos; no supernovae, no heating of the primitive earth, no\natmosphere or hydrosphere. There would be no protective magnetic field, no Van\nAllen radiation belts, no ozone layer, no metal to make hemoglobin [in human\nblood], no metal to tame the reactivity of oxygen, and no oxidative metabolism.\n“The intriguing and intimate relationship between life\nand iron, between the red color of blood and the dying of some distant star,\nnot only indicates the relevance of metals to biology but also the\nbiocentricity of the cosmos…”\n[4]\nThis account clearly indicates the importance of the\niron atom. The fact that particular attention is drawn to iron in the Quran\nalso emphasizes the importance of the element.\nMoreover, iron oxide particles were used in a cancer\ntreatment in recent months and positive developments were observed. A team led\nby Dr. Andreas Jordan, at the world famous Charité Hospital in Germany, succeeded in destroying cancer cells with this new technique developed for the\ntreatment of cancer—magnetic fluid hyperthermia (high temperature magnetic\nliquid). As a result of this technique, first performed on the 26-year-old\nNikolaus H., no new cancer cells were observed in the patient in the following\nthree months.\nThis method of treatment can be summarized as follows:\n1. A liquid containing iron oxide particles is\ninjected into the tumour by means of a special syringe. These particles spread\nthroughout the tumour cells. This liquid consists of thousands of millions of\nparticles, 1,000 times smaller than the red blood corpuscles, of iron oxide in\n1 cm3 that can easily flow through all blood vessels.\n[5]\n2. The patient is then placed in a machine with a\npowerful magnetic field.\n3. This magnetic field, applied externally, begins\nto set the iron particles in the tumour in motion. During this time the\ntemperature in the tumour containing the iron oxide particles rises by up to 45\ndegrees.\n4. In a few minutes the cancer cells, unable to\nprotect themselves from the heat, are either weakened or destroyed. The tumour\nmay then be completely eradicated with subsequent chemotherapy.\n[6]\nIn this treatment it is only the cancer cells that are\naffected by the magnetic field, since only they contain the iron oxide\nparticles. The spread of this technique is a major development in the treatment\nof this potentially lethal disease. Iron has also been found to be a cure for\npeople suffering from anemia. In the treatment of such a widespread diseases,\nthe use of the expression “iron in which there lies great force and which has\nmany uses for mankind” (Quran, 57:25) in the Quran is particularly noteworthy.\nIndeed, in that verse, the Quran may be indicating the benefits of iron even for\nhuman health.

    "content": "Hubble’s Law\nFor thousands of years, astronomers wrestled with basic\nquestions concerning the universe.  Until the early 1920’s, it was believed\nthat the universe had always been in existence; also, that the size of the\nuniverse was fixed and not changing.  However, in 1912, the American astronomer,\nVesto Slipher, made a discovery that would soon change astronomers’ beliefs\nabout the universe.  Slipher, noticed that the galaxies were moving away from\nearth at huge velocities.  These observations provided the first evidence\nsupporting the expanding-universe theory.\n[1]\nBefore the invention of the telescope in 1608, man could do\nlittle more than wonder about the origin of the universe. (Courtesy: NASA)\nIn 1916, Albert Einstein formulated his General Theory\nof Relativity that indicated that the universe must be either expanding or\ncontracting.  Confirmation of the expanding-universe theory finally came in\n1929 in the hands of the well known American astronomer Edwin Hubble.\nBy observing redshifts\n[2]\nin the light wavelengths emitted by galaxies, Hubble found that galaxies were\nnot fixed in their position; instead, they were actually moving away from us\nwith speeds proportional to their distance from earth (Hubble's Law).  The only\nexplanation for this observation was that the universe had to be expanding.  Hubble’s\ndiscovery is regarded as one of the greatest in the history of astronomy.  In\n1929, he published the velocity-time relation which is the basis of modern\ncosmology.  In the years to come, with further observations, the\nexpanding-universe theory was accepted by scientists and astronomers alike.\nWith the Hooker Telescope, Hubble discovered that the galaxies\nwere moving away from us.  Above are photos of known galaxies.  (Courtesy: NASA)\nYet, astonishingly well before telescopes were even invented\nand well before Hubble published his Law, Prophet Muhammad used to recite a\nverse of the Quran to his companions that ultimately stated that the universe is\nexpanding.\n“And the heaven We created with might, and indeed We are (its)\nexpander.” (Quran 51:47)\nAt the time of the revelation of the Quran, the word “space”\nwas not known, and people used the word “heaven” to refer to what lies above the\nEarth.  In the above verse, the word “heaven” is referring to space and the known\nuniverse.  The verse points out that space, and thus the universe, happens to\nbe expanding, just as Hubble’s Law states.\nThat the Quran mentioned such a fact centuries before\nthe invention of the first telescope, at a time when there was primitive knowledge\nin science, is considered remarkable.  This is more so considering that, like\nmany people in his time, Prophet Muhammad happened to be illiterate and simply\ncould not have been aware of such facts by himself.  Could it be that he had\ntruly received divine revelation from the Creator and Originator of the\nuniverse?\nThe Big Bang Theory\nSoon after Hubble\npublished\nhis theory, he went on to discover that not only were galaxies moving away from\nthe Earth, but were also moving away from one another.  This meant that the\nuniverse happened to be expanding in every direction, in the same way a balloon\nexpands when filled with air.  Hubble’s new findings placed the foundations for\nthe Big Bang theory.\nThe Big Bang theory states that around 12-15 billion\nyears ago the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot and\ndense point, and that something triggered the explosion of this point that\nbrought about the beginning of the universe.  The universe, since then, has\nbeen expanding from this single point.\nLater, in 1965,\nradio\nastronomers\nArno Penzias and Robert Wilson made a Noble Prize winning\ndiscovery that confirmed the Big Bang theory.  Prior to their discovery, the\ntheory implied that if the single point from which the universe came into\nexistence was initially extremely hot, then remnants of this heat should be\nfound.  This remnant heat is exactly what Penzias and Wilson found.  In 1965,\nPenzias and Wilson discovered a 2.725 degree Kelvin Cosmic Microwave Background\nRadiation (CMB) that spreads through the universe.  Thus, it was understood\nthat the radiation found was a remnant of the initial stages of the Big Bang.  Presently,\nthe Big Bang theory is accepted by the vast majority of scientists and\nastronomers.\nA microwave map of the leftover from the Big Bang that gave\nbirth to the universe. (Courtesy: NASA)\nIt is mentioned in the Quran:\n“He (God) is the Originator of the heavens and the earth…”\n(Quran 6:101)\n“Is not He who created the\nheavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them?  Yes; and He is the\nKnowing Creator. His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to\nit, ‘Be,’ and it is.” (Quran 36:81-82)\nThe above verses prove that the universe had a\nbeginning, that God was behind its creation, and all that God needs to do\ninorder to create is to say “Be,” and it is.  Could this be an explanation as to\nwhat triggered off the explosion that brought about the beginning of the\nuniverse?\nThe Quran also mentions:\n“Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens\nand the earth were a joined entity, then We separated them, and made from water\nevery living thing?  Then will they not believe?” (Quran 21:30)\nMuslim scholars who have explained the previous verse\nmention that the heavens and earth were once one, and then God caused them to\nseparate and form into the seven heavens and Earth.  Yet, due to the limitations\nof science and technology at the time of the revelation of the Quran (and for\ncenturies to follow), no scholar was able to give much detail about how exactly\nthe heavens and earth were created.  What the scholars could explain was the\nprecise meaning of each word in Arabic in the verse, as well as the overall\nmeaning of the verse.\nIn the previous verse, the Arabic words\nratq\nand\nfataq\nare used\n.\nThe word\nratq\ncan be translated into “\nentity\n” “\nsewn to\n”\n“\njoined together\n” or “\nclosed up\n”.  The meaning of these translations all\ncirculate around something that is mixed and that has a separate and distinct\nexistence.  The verb\nfataq\nis\ntranslated into “\nWe unstitched\n” “\nWe clove them asunder\n” “\nWe separated\n” or “\nWe\nhave opened them\n”.  These meanings imply that something comes into\nbeing by an action of splitting or tearing apart.  The sprouting of a seed from\nthe soil is a good example of a similar illustration of the meaning of the verb\nfataq\n.\nWith the introduction of the Big Bang theory, it soon\nbecame clear to Muslim scholars that the details mentioned with regards to the\ntheory go identically hand in hand with the description of the creation of the\nuniverse in verse 30 of chapter 21 of the Quran.  The theory states that all\nthe matter in the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot\nand dense point; that exploded and brought about the beginning of the universe,\nmatches what is mentioned in the verse that the heaven and Earth (thus the\nuniverse) where once joined together, and  then split apart.  Once again, the\nonly possible explanation is that Prophet Muhammad had truly received divine\nrevelation from God, The Creator and Originator of the universe.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe First\nThree Minutes, a Modern View of the Origin of the Universe, Weinberg.\n[2]\nWhen the light an object emits is displaced toward the red end of the spectrum.\n(http://bjp.org.cn/apod/glossary.htm)",

    "content": "Ever since the dawn\nof mankind, we have sought to understand nature and our place in it.  In this\nquest for the purpose of life many people have turned to religion.  Most\nreligions are based on books claimed by their followers to be divinely\ninspired, without any proof.  Islam is different because it is based upon\nreason and proof.\nThere are clear signs that the book of Islam, the Quran,\nis the word of God and we have many reasons to support this claim:\n·There are scientific and historical facts\nfound in the Quran which were unknown to the people at the time, and have only\nbeen discovered recently by contemporary science.\n·The Quran is in a unique style of language\nthat cannot be replicated, this is known as the ‘Inimitability of the Quran.’\n·There are prophecies made in the Quran and\nby the Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, which\nhave come to be pass.\nThis article lays out and explains the scientific facts\nthat are found in the Quran, centuries before they were ‘discovered’ in\ncontemporary science.  It is important to note that the Quran is not a book of\nscience but a book of ‘signs’.  These signs are there for people to recognise\nGod’s existence and affirm His revelation.  As we know, science sometimes takes\na ‘U-turn’ where what once scientifically correct is false a few years later.  In\nthis article only established scientific facts are considered, not just\ntheories or hypothesis.\nScientific Facts in the Quran\nThe Quran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad in the\n7th century.\nScience at the time was primitive, there were no\ntelescopes, microscopes or anything even close to the technology we have today. \nPeople believed that the sun orbited the earth and that the sky was held up by\nbig pillars at the corners of a flat earth.  Within this backdrop the Quran was\nrevealed, and it contains many scientific facts on topics ranging from\nastronomy to biology, geology to sociology.\nSome people may claim that the Quran was changed as new\nscientific facts were discovered but this cannot be the case because it is a\nhistorically documented fact that the Quran is preserved in its original\nlanguage\n[1]\n. \nThe Quran was written down and memorised by people during the lifetime of the\nProphet Muhammad.  One of the copies of the Quran which was written a few years\nafter the death of the Prophet Muhammad is preserved in a museum in Uzbekistan. \nThis copy is over 1400 years old and is exactly the same as the Arabic Quran\nthat we have today\n[2]\n.\nThe following are nine scientific facts found in the\nQuran:\n1.  Origin of Life\nWater is essential for all living things.  We all know\nthat water is vital to life but the Quran makes a very unusual claim:\nWe made every living thing from water? Will they not believe?\n(Quran 21:30)\nIn this verse water is pointed out as the origin of all\nlife.  All living things are made of cells.  We now know that cells are mostly\nmade up of water\n[3]\n. \nFor example, 80% of the cytoplasm (basic cell material) of a standard animal\ncell is described as water in biology textbooks.\nThe fact that living things consist mostly of water was\ndiscovered only after the invention of the microscope.  In the deserts of Arabia,\nthe last thing someone would have guessed is that all life came from water.\n2.  Iron\nIron is not natural to the earth.  It did not form on\nthe earth but came down to earth from outer space.  This may sound strange but\nit’s true.  Scientists have found that billions of years ago the earth was\nstuck by meteorites.  These meteorites were carrying Iron from distant stars\nwhich had exploded\n[4]\n.\nThe Quran says the following on the origin of Iron:\n“We sent down Iron with its great inherent strength and its\nmany benefits for humankind.” (Quran 57:25)\nGod uses the words ‘sent down’ for Iron.  It is clear\nfrom the verse that Iron is not an earthly material, but was sent down for the\nbenefit of humanity.  The fact that Iron came down to earth from outer space is\nsomething which could not be known by the primitive science of the 7th century.\n3.  Sky’s Protection\nThe sky plays a crucial role in protecting the earth.  The\nsky protects the earth from the lethal rays of the sun.  If the sky did not\nexist then the sun’s radiation would have killed off all life on earth.  It\nalso acts like a blanket wrapped around the earth, to protect it from the\nfreezing cold of space.  The temperature just above the sky is approximately\n-270oC.  If this temperature was to reach earth then the planet would freeze\nover instantly.  The sky also protects life on earth by warming the surface\nthrough heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes\nbetween day and night\n[5]\n. \nThese are some of the many protective functions of the sky.\nThe Quran asks us to consider the sky in the following\nverse:\n“We made the sky a protective ceiling.  And yet they are\nturning away from Our signs!” (Quran 21:32)\nThe Quran points to the sky’s protection as a sign of\nGod.  The protective properties of the sky were discovered by scientific\nresearch conducted in the 20th century.\n4.  Mountains\nThe Quran draws our attention to a very important\ncharacteristic of mountains:\n“Did We not make the earth a resting place? And the mountains\nas stakes?” (Quran 78:6-7)\nThe Quran indicates that mountains have deep roots by\nusing the word stakes to describe them.  In fact mountains do have deep roots,\nand the word stakes is an accurate description for them.  A book titled ‘Earth’\nby Geophysicist Frank Press explains that mountains are like stakes, and are\nburied deep under the surface of the earth. Mount Everest (pictured below), the\nheight of which is approximately 9 km above ground, has a root deeper than 125\nkm.\nThe fact that mountains have deep ‘stake’ like roots was\nnot known, until after the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the\nbeginning of the 20th century.\n[6]\n5.  Expansion of the Universe\nAt a time when the science of Astronomy was still\nprimitive, the expansion of the universe was described in Quran:\n“And it is We who have built the Universe with [Our creative]\npower and keep expanding it.” (Quran 51:47)\nThe fact that the universe is expanding was discovered\nin the last century.  The physicist Stephen Hawking in his book ‘A Brief\nHistory of Time’ writes, “The discovery that the universe is expanding was one\nof the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.”.\nThe Quran mentioned the expansion of the universe even\nbefore the invention of the telescope!\n6.  Sun’s Orbit\nIn 1512 the astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forward\nhis theory that the Sun is motionless at the centre of the solar system, and\nthat the planets revolve around it.  The belief that the Sun is stationary was\nwidespread amongst astronomers until the 20th century.  It is now a\nwell-established scientific fact that the Sun is not stationary, but is moving\nin an orbit around the centre of our Milky Way galaxy\n[7]\n.\nThe Quran mentions the orbit of the Sun:\n“It is He who created night and day, the Sun and the Moon,\neach floating in its orbit.” (Quran 21:33)\nThe Quran would have been wrong according to astronomers\njust a couple of decades ago.  But we now know that the Quranic account of the\nSun’s motion is consistent with modern Astronomy.\n7.  The Ocean\nThe Quran uses imagery to covey its deep meanings, here\nit describes the state of the unbelievers as:\n“Darkness out in a deep ocean which is covered by waves, above\nwhich are waves, above which are clouds, layers of darkness, one upon the other. \nWhen one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it.  Those God gives no\nlight to, they have no light.” (Quran 24:40)\nIt is commonly thought that waves only occur on the\nsurface of the ocean.  However oceanographers have discovered that there are\ninternal waves that take place below the surface of the ocean.  These waves are\ninvisible to the human eye, and can only be detected by specialist equipment\n[8]\n.  The Quran\nmentions darkness in a deep ocean above which are waves, above which are waves,\nthen clouds above that.  This description is not only remarkable because it\ndescribes the internal waves in the ocean, but also because it describes\ndarkness deep in the ocean.  A human being can dive no more than 70 metres\nwithout breathing equipment.  Light is present at that depth, but if we go down\n1000 metres it is completely dark\n[9]\n. \n1400 years ago there were no submarines or specialist equipment to discover\ninternal waves or the darkness deep inside the oceans.\n8.  Lying and Movement\nThere was a cruel oppressive tribal leader named Abu Jahl\nwho lived during the time of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of\nGod be upon him.  God revealed a verse of the Quran to warn him:\n“No Indeed! If he does not stop, We will seize him by the\nforehead, his lying, sinful forehead.” (Quran 96:15-16)\nGod does not call this person a liar, but calls his\nforehead (the front part of the brain) ‘lying’ and ‘sinful’, and warns him to\nstop.\nThis verse is significant for two reasons.  The first is\nthat the front part of our brain is responsible for voluntary movement\n[10]\n.This is\nknown as the frontal lobe.  A book titled ‘Essentials of Anatomy and\nPhysiology’ which includes the results of research on the functions of this\narea states: The motivation and the foresight to plan and initiate movements\noccur in the anterior portion of the frontal lobes, the prefrontal area\n[11]\n.  The part\nof the brain that is responsible for movement is said to be seized if the man\ndoes not stop.\nSecondly, numerous studies have shown that this same\nregion (frontal lobe) is responsible for the lying function of the brain\n[12]\n.  One such\nstudy at the University of Pennsylvania in which volunteers were asked\nquestions during a computerized interrogation, it was found that when the\nvolunteers were lying there was significantly increased activity in the\nprefrontal and premotor cortices (frontal lobe region)\n[13]\n.\nThe front part of the brain is responsible for movement\nand lying.  The Quran links movement and lying to this area.  These functions\nof the frontal lobe were discovered with medical imaging equipment which was\ndeveloped in the 20th century.\n9.  Pain Receptors\nFor a long time it was thought that the sense of feeling\nand pain was dependent on the brain.  However it has been discovered that there\nare pain receptors present in the skin\n[14]\n. \nWithout these pain receptors, a person would not be able to feel pain.\nConsider the following verse on pain:\n“We shall send those who reject Our revelations to the (Hell)\nFire.  When their skins have been burned away, We shall replace them with new\nones so that they may continue to feel the pain: God is Almighty, All-Wise.”\n(Quran 4:56)\nGod tells the people who reject his message that when\nthey are in Hell and their skins are burnt off (so they can’t feel any pain),\nhe will give them new skins so that they continue to feel the pain.\nThe Quran makes it clear that pain is dependent upon on\nthe skin.  The discovery of pain receptors in the skin is a fairly recent\ndiscovery for Biology.\nConclusion\nThese are just some of the many scientific facts found\nin the Quran.  It is important to note that the Quran is not a book of science,\nbut that it is consistent with science.  To claim that scientific facts in the\nQuran are due to coincidence would be irrational.  The best explanation is that\nGod revealed this knowledge to the Prophet Muhammad.\nJust like the Quran contains knowledge about the natural\nworld, it also contains information about the inner dimensions of our souls.  It\nrelates to our feelings, wants and needs.  The Quran informs us that we have a\npurpose in life, and that following God’s guidance will lead us to inner peace\nin this life, and Paradise in the hereafter.  And that rejection of his message\nwill lead to depression in this life and Hellfire after death.\n“We shall show them Our signs in the Universe and within\nthemselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the Truth.  Is it not\nenough that your Lord is the witness of all things?” (Quran 41:53)\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe Magnificent Qur’an: A Unique History of Preservation\n[2]\n(http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4581684.stm)\n[3]\nBruce Alberts, Essential Cell Biology\n[4]\nM.

    "content": "The example of\nthose who take associates other than God is like that of the spider who takes\n(i.e.  constructs) a home.  And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the\nspider, if they only knew. (Quran 29:41)\nThis verse of the Quran\ncomes from chapter 29, the Spider.  The part of interest here is that God\nmentions that the weakest of all homes is that of a spider.  In the rich Arabic\nlanguage, the word Awhan is translated into the (weakest); and a\ndeeper look into the meaning suggests that it means severe weakness and\nhelplessness both physically and mentally.\nWith the\nexpansion of the study of nature and wildlife in the 20\nth\nand 21\nst\ncenturies naturalists and scientists have unraveled, documented and videoed\ntruly bizarre observations in the life of spiders.\nSexual Cannibalism\nOut of the over\n45,000 known species of spiders, it is very common that male spiders are killed\nand eaten by their female spouses\n[1]\n; a term known as sexual cannibalism.   It is not\nknown why this occurs, however, one theory suggested by scientists is that the\nmale's body provides the female with much-needed nutrients that enables her to\nlay healthy eggs.  A study by Spain's Experimental Station of Arid Zone\nrevealed that in most spider species, aggressive females kill their mates\nindiscriminately regardless if the male is considered inferior or not\n.\n[2]\nIn many species,\nfemale spiders even kill potential mates they are not interested to mate with.\n[3]\nCannibal Jumping Spider - Credit: Shawn M.  Wilder\nIn some spider\nspecies, such as the dark fishing spider, the male spider automatically dies\nafter mating due to internal reasons; and is then cruelly eaten by his bride.\n[4]\nOther male spider\nspecies die automatically after mating only a few times and in the vast\nmajority of species females outlive males; with males living for only a few\nmonths and females a few years.\nWhen lucky enough\nto mate and survive the ordeal, the smaller sized male spiders, knowing their spouse's\ncannibalistic\ninstinct, will then immediately make a run for their\nlives\n[5]\nleaving\nthe female to nurse anywhere from a few dozen to around a thousand eggs all by\nherself.  Such is the case with the Brazilian Wandering Spider.\nIn a further\ntwist to spiders' lethal mating customs a study released by\nresearchers\nLenka Sentenska and Stano Pekar, from Masaryk University in the Czech Republic\nin 2013, found that in the Micaria Sociabilis species of black widow spiders\nboth female and male spiders commonly kill and eat the other after mating; and\nthat in this specific species, contrary to what was believed, male spiders more\ncommonly kill and eat their spouses than females kill males.\n[6]\nLife as a Spiderling\nIn the vast\nmajority of species, the newly born spiderlings have only their mother to feed\nand protect them.  When food becomes scarce the mother is forced to feed her\nyoung unhatched eggs; hence a young spiderling must go through the trauma of\neating their own unborn brothers and sisters to stay alive.\n[7]\nWhen there are no more unhatched eggs to feed on\nand not enough insects falling into the web or caught by mother another common\nobservation is that spiderlings, in desperation, turn cannibal on each other\nand the small overcrowded web turns into a confined cage of massacre.  Helpless\nas is she is, the mother spider also commonly engages in killing and eating her\nown young just to get through another day.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nPappas, Stephanie.  June 2016.  Male Orb-Web Spiders Are\nChoosy About Their Cannibal Mate.\nLive Science\n.  Retrieved from\nhttp://www.livescience.com/54944-male-orb-web-spiders-choosy-about-cannibal-mate.html\n[2]\nGannon, Megan.  April 2014.  Food vs.  Sex: Why Some\nFemale Spiders Eat Males Before Mating.\nLive Science\n.  Retrieved from\nhttp://www.livescience.com/45066-virgin-female-spiders-eat-males.html\n[3]\nGannon, Megan.  April 2014.  Food vs.  Sex: Why Some\nFemale Spiders Eat Males Before Mating.\nLive Science\n.  Retrieved from\nhttp://www.livescience.com/45066-virgin-female-spiders-eat-males.html\n[4]\nLewis, Tanya.  June 2013.  Tough Love: Male Spiders Die\nfor Sex.\nLive Science\n.  Retrieved from\nhttp://www.livescience.com/37536-spiders-die-for-sex.html\n[5]\nSzalay, Jessie.  December 2014.  Tarantula Facts.\nLive\nScience\n.  Retrieved from\nhttp://www.livescience.com/39963-tarantula.html\n[6]\nCadieux-Shaw, Lillianne.  May 2013.  Study: Male Black\nWidow Spiders eat their Mates too.\nCanadian Geographic\n.  Retrieved from\nhttp://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/study-male-black-widow-spiders-eat-their-mates-too\n[7]\nEnglehaupt, Erika.  February 2014.  Some Animals …facts.\nScience News\n.  Retrieved from\nhttps://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/some-animals-eat-their-moms-and-other-cannibalism-facts",

    "content": "Matriphagy\nYet the most\nbizarre part of a spider household is what happens when the female spider has\nreached unprecedented levels of desperation and anxiety and can no longer keep\nher young alive.  Having lost perhaps hundreds of her young and still stuck\nwith several more hundred spiderlings; the mother, astonishingly, sacrifices\nher own body as food for her young by unleashing their killer instinct that\nmakes them attack and eat her alive! This cruel process is known as matriphagy or\nmother eating.\n[1]\nFemale\nStegodyphus\nlineatus Spider\nbeing eaten alive by\nher own young\n–\nCredit: Jorge Almeida\nWhat is known, so\nfar, is that matriphagy is a process initiated by the female spider and that\nits methods vary from one species to another.  Venomous spiderlings even poison\ntheir own mother to death; but in all cases matriphagy is a slow and painful\nprocess that takes weeks before the mother spider actually dies as her body\nfluids are eventually consumed by her own young.\n[2]\nSuch a process\nhas been observed and documented in ground spiders, the\nStegodyphus\nlineatus spider\n[3]\nand crab spiders and only through further\nresearch can it be determined just how widespread matriphagy is in the\nmiserable world of spiders.\nIn retrospect,\nmating in the world of spiders, most often leads to the death of the male\nspider and the widowing of the female; the mother is left all alone with, on\naverage, a few hundred young to feed and protect from predators, is forced to\nfeed unhatched eggs to her spiderlings to keep them alive, and commonly eats\nher young to keep herself alive.  Spiderlings also turn to cannibalism and kill\nand eat each other; and ultimately and most astonishingly, in dire situations\nmother spiders sacrifice themselves to their own young to be eaten.  The final\nresult, at best, only a few of the hundreds of spiderlings actually survive to leave\nthe torment of the web.\nNow, knowing the\ncruel nature of a spider's household, Praise be to God Almighty, Who mentioned\nthat the worst household is that of a spider, long before naturalists and\nscientists started to study spider behavior in detail.  It can now be stated,\nas a fact, that life in a spider web is totally bizarre and after comparison\nwith households of other creatures, is truly the worst, most cruel and\nmiserable of all households!!!\nThe Message in the\nVerse of the Quran\nThere is a clear\nwarning in the concerned verse of the Quran.  God has compared those who take\nassociates or gods, with Him in worship, to those who take a spider's web as a\nhome.  The Quran and the authentic traditions of Prophet Muhammad, may the\nmercy and blessings of God be upon him, are both extremely clear that only God,\nThe Creator of all, deserves to be worshiped, directly, not through any\nintermediaries or associates.  This is known as Monotheism.\nWorship God and\nassociate nothing with Him (Quran 4:36)\nAnd when Abraham said\nto his father and his people, ‘Indeed, I am disassociated from that what you\nworship (statues).  Except for He Who created me; and indeed, He will guide me.’\n(Quran 43:26,27)\nThe message of\nIslam and of all the Prophets and Messengers is to worship God alone and that\nworshipping God through intermediaries or associates such as prophets, angels,\npious people, animals, creatures, objects or anything is polytheism; the\ngravest of all sins.  All acts of worship, including supplication, prayers, and\nslaughter of animals should be directed only to God.\nThe Quran mentions\nthat such associates cannot even respond to (and in some cases, not even see or\nhear) the prayers of the person who is supplicating to them.  Such is the case\nwhen someone wrongly goes to the grave of a Prophet, or a deceased pious\nperson, or a statue and supplicates and asks them to forgive his/her sins or\ncure him/her from an illness.  The previous-mentioned have zero ability to do\nthe required.  Furthermore, God mentions that He never ordered any of His creation\nto take associates with Him; in fact all of mankind was created with the pure\ninstinct that God Almighty is One and that He Alone has the right to be\nworshipped.\nThe Unforgivable Sin\nThe largest of\nall sins, polytheism, is to associate anything with God Almighty in worship.  This\nis one sin that God has stated that He will not forgive in the Hereafter; while\nall other sins can be forgiven.\nImagine the\ninjustice of a person who was created by God (gently and mercifully in his\nmother’s womb) after once being nothing, who was gifted with a soul, was\nblessed with a brain, a heart, sight, hearing, feelings, a habitable, beautiful\nand scenic earth full of plants and animals to eat from, and raw materials\nwhich mankind has utilized to build cities and infrastructures; then this\nperson does not give his praise, thanks and worship to God Almighty, instead\ngives so to a creation of God (that did nothing of the above-mentioned).\nAnd,\nwhen Luqman said to his son while he was advising him, ‘O my son, do not\nassociate [anything] with God [in worship].  Indeed, association [with Him] is\na great injustice.’ (Quran 31:13)\nThose who die,\nnot having repented from worshipping other than God, will lose in the Hereafter. \nAs for the human associates that used to be worshiped in this life they will\ndissociate themselves from the people who used to invoke them.  While, the\nnon-human associates will turn against and betray the people who used to\nworship them; and will state (God will give them the ability to speak) that in\nreality no one was truly worshiping them.  As a result,both the\ninvokers and non-human associates in worship will be placed in Hell.\nAnd\n[Abraham] said, ‘You have taken [for worship] idols instead of God, and the\nlove between you is only in the life of this world.  Then on the Day of\nResurrection you will deny one another and curse one another, and your refugee\nwill be the Fire, and you will not have any helpers.’ (Quran 29:25)\nHence the spider\nweb can be compared to Hell, a confined and miserable place of suffering.  The\nmother spider that gave her life, so that her young may live, can be compared\nto a person who used to worship many different associates (her many\nspiderlings) with God.  Since the non-human associates that used to be\nworshipped will also be in Hell and will betray the person who used to worship\nthem, the result will be unbearable pain and suffering of that person, similar\nto how the spiderlings betray and turn on their own mother and are the cause of\nher torture and suffering in the web.  Only in the next life there will be no\ndeath; Hell and Heaven will be eternal.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nEnglehaupt, Erika.  February 2014.  Some Animals eat\ntheir moms, and other cannibalism facts.\nScience News\n.  Retrieved from\nhttps://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/some-animals-eat-their-moms-and-other-cannibalism-facts\n[2]\nPlease watch:\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/worlds-weirdest/videos/mother-eating-spiders/\n[3]\nZielinski, Sarah.  May 2015.  Animal moms sacrifice a\nlot – sometimes even themselves.\nScience News\n.  Retrieved from\nhttps://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/animal-moms-sacrifice-lot-%E2%80%94-sometimes-even-themselves",

    "content": "A simple image of Earth and the interior layers.\nWindows\nto the Universe\n, at (http://www.windows.ucar.edu) at the University\nCorporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).  ©1995-1999, 2000 The Regents of\nthe University of Michigan; ©2000-05 University Corporation for Atmospheric\nResearch.\nThe Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad is the second revealed\nsource of Islam.  Like the Quran, it contains scientific information unavailable\n1400 years ago.  From these miracles is the seven earths, mentioned by the\nProphet in several of his sayings.  From them are the following two:\nHadith 1\nIt was narrated on the authority of Abu Salamah that a\ndispute arose between him and some other people (about a piece of land).  When\nhe told Aisha (the Prophet’s wife) about it, she said, ‘O Abu Salamah!  Avoid\ntaking the land unjustly, for the Prophet said:\nWhoever usurps even one span of land of somebody, its\ndepth through the seven earths will be collared to his neck. (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari, ‘Book of Oppression.’\n)\nHadith 2\nSalim narrated on the authority of his father that the\nProphet said:\nWhoever takes a piece of land of others unjustly,\nhe will sink down the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari,\n‘Book of Oppression.’\n)\nThe aforementioned hadith prohibits oppression in\ngeneral, especially the taking of a piece of land belonging to others unjustly.  What might the seven earths refer to?\nStudies in geology have proven that the earth is\ncomposed of seven zones, identified from the inner to the outer layers as\nfollows:\n(1)  The Solid Inner Core of Earth: 1.7% of the\nEarth’s mass; depth of 5,150 - 6,370 kilometers (3,219 - 3,981 miles)\nThe inner core is solid and unattached to the mantle,\nsuspended in the molten outer core.  It is believed to have solidified as a\nresult of pressure-freezing which occurs to most liquids when temperature\ndecreases or pressure increases.\n(2)  The Liquid Outer core: 30.8% of Earth’s mass;\ndepth of 2,890 - 5,150 kilometers (1,806 - 3,219 miles)\nThe outer core is a hot, electrically conducting liquid\nwithin which convective motion occurs.  This conductive layer combines with\nEarth’s rotation to create a dynamo effect that maintains a system of\nelectrical currents known as the Earth’s magnetic field.  It is also\nresponsible for the subtle jerking of Earth’s rotation.  This layer is not as\ndense as pure molten iron, which indicates the presence of lighter elements.  Scientists\nsuspect that about 10% of the layer is composed of sulfur and/or oxygen because\nthese elements are abundant in the cosmos and dissolve readily in molten iron.\n(3)  The D Layer: 3% of Earth’s mass; depth of\n2,700 - 2,890 kilometers (1,688 - 1,806 miles)\nThis layer is 200 to 300 kilometers (125 to 188 miles)\nthick and represents about 4% of the mantle-crust mass.  Although it is often\nidentified as part of the lower mantle, seismic discontinuities suggest the D\nlayer might differ chemically from the lower mantle lying above it.  Scientists\ntheorize that the material either dissolved in the core, or was able to sink\nthrough the mantle but not into the core because of its density.\n(4)  Lower Mantle: 49.2% of Earth’s mass; depth of\n650 - 2,890 kilometers (406 -1,806 miles)\nThe lower mantle contains 72.9% of the mantle-crust mass\nand is probably composed mainly of silicon, magnesium, and oxygen.  It probably\nalso contains some iron, calcium, and aluminum.  Scientists make these\ndeductions by assuming the Earth has a similar abundance and proportion of\ncosmic elements as found in the Sun and primitive meteorites.\n(5)  Middle Mantle (Transition region): 7.5% of\nEarth’s mass; depth of 400 - 650 kilometers (250-406 miles)\nThe transition region or mesosphere (for middle mantle),\nsometimes called the fertile layer, contains 11.1% of the mantle-crust mass and\nis the source of basaltic magmas.  It also contains calcium, aluminum, and\ngarnet, which is a complex aluminum-bearing silicate mineral.  This layer is\ndense when cold because of the garnet.  It is buoyant when hot because these\nminerals melt easily to form basalt which can then rise through the upper\nlayers as magma.\n(6)  Upper Mantle: 10.3% of Earth’s mass; depth of\n10 - 400 kilometers (6 - 250 miles)\nThe upper mantle contains 15.3% of the mantle-crust mass. \nFragments have been excavated for our observation by eroded mountain belts and\nvolcanic eruptions.  Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 and pyroxene (Mg,Fe)SiO3 have been\nthe primary minerals found in this way.  These and other minerals are\nrefractory and crystalline at high temperatures; therefore, most settle out of\nrising magma, either forming new material or never leaving the mantle.  Part of\nthe upper mantle called the asthenosphere might be partially molten.\n(7)  Lithosphere\nOceanic crust: 0.099% of Earth’s mass; depth of 0-10\nkilometers (0 - 6 miles)\nThe rigid, outermost layer of the Earth comprising the\ncrust and upper mantle is called the lithosphere.  The oceanic crust contains\n0.147% of the mantle-crust mass.  The majority of the Earth’s crust was made\nthrough volcanic activity.  The oceanic ridge system, a 40,000-kilometer\n(25,000 mile) network of volcanoes, generates new oceanic crust at the rate of\n17 km3 per year, covering the ocean floor with basalt.  Hawaii and Iceland are two examples of the accumulation of basalt piles.\nThis image shows a cross section through the earth’s crust\nand upper mantle showing lithosphere plates (made of the crust layer and the\ntop part of the mantle) moving over the asthenosphere (upper mantle).\nWindows\nto the Universe\n, at (http://www.windows.ucar.edu) at the University\nCorporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).  ©1995-1999, 2000 The Regents of\nthe University of Michigan; ©2000-05 University Corporation for Atmospheric\nResearch.  Continental crust:\n0.374% of Earth’s mass; depth of 0-50 kilometers (0 - 31 miles)\nThe continental crust contains 0.554% of the\nmantle-crust mass.  This is the outer part of the Earth composed essentially of\ncrystalline rocks.  These are low-density buoyant minerals dominated mostly by\nquartz (SiO2) and feldspars (metal-poor silicates).  The crust (both oceanic\nand continental) is the surface of the Earth; as such, it is the coldest part\nof our planet.  Because cold rocks deform slowly, we refer to this rigid outer\nshell as the lithosphere (the rocky or strong layer).\nThis image shows the divisions of the Earth’s interior into\n7 layers.  (Adapted from Beatty, 1990).\nConclusion\nThe layers of the earth coincide with the above mentioned\nhadith of the Prophet.  The miracle is in two matters:\n(1)  The expression of the hadith,\n‘He will sink\ndown the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection,’\nindicates the\nstratification of these earths around one center.\n(2)  The accuracy with which the Prophet of Islam\nreferred to the seven inner layers of earth.\nThe only way for a desert dweller to have known these\nfacts 1400 years ago is through revelation from God.\nReferences\nBeatty, J.

    "content": "From the miracles of the sayings\nof the Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, is that\nthe Arabian Peninsulawas once a lush green land full of trees and rivers. \nProphet Muhammad said,\n\nThe Last Hour will\nnot come… till the land of Arabia once again becomes meadows and\nrivers.\n[1]\nThere was no way Prophet Muhammad who was illiterate could\nhave known, given the limitation of scientific and technological capabilities\nat the time, such a fact by himself.  What is equally striking is that\ncurrently the Arabian Peninsula is the complete opposite of a lush green place. \nInstead it has one of the hottest climates in the world, with zero permanent\nrivers and about 85% of the 2\nnd\nlargest desert in the world, the\nArabian Desert lies in it as well as the entire largest sand desert in the\nworld, the Empty Quarter (the Empty Quarter has an average rainfall of 4\ninches annually and temperatures can reach an unbearable 54 degrees\ncentigrade).\n[2]\nStudies in geology and archeology have recently confirmed\nto a degree beyond any doubt that the Arabian Peninsula once had a much cooler\nclimate and that it truly was a lush green area full of trees, lakes and rivers. \nSuch is based on the following:\n1)   Scientists have documented that earth\nwitnessed its most resent ice age during the\nPleistocene\nEpoch period that began about 2.59 million years ago and ended about 11,700\nyears ago.\n[3]\nDuring this period large parts of the earth were covered\nin ice and the climate was much cooler than what it is today with average\nglobal temperatures 5°C to 10°C below current average temperatures.  While ice\ncovered parts of Europe, Asia and the America’s, the Arabian Peninsula\nwitnessed a pleasant climate much like Europe’s current climate.\n2)   In 2014 researchers in Saudi Arabia discovered\nfossilized remains of an elephant in the Nafud Desert.  With over 60% of the\nelephant’s fossilized bones intact, including an entire tusk, it remarkably\nindicates that the Nafud desert once had a climate suitable for elephants to\nlive in.  It is also worth mentioning that the discovered elephant was 50%\nlarger in size and about twice the weight of the current day elephant.\n[4]\nMore so, in 2017\nSaudi Arabia’s Centre for International Communication announced the\ndiscovery of fossils of other creatures including crocodiles and seahorses, and\nmore remarkably the discovery, in total, of 10,000 ancient lake and river beds\nacross the Arabian Peninsula.\n[5]\nFurthermore, in 2017\nDr.  Eid Al Yahya, a\nwell-known archeologist, discovered the first ever fossilized mammoth in Saudi \nArabia; and throughout the past decade has discovered and documented over a\nthousand flint spearheads (made of silica) and other advanced large-prey\nhunting tools in remote desert locations that indicate that civilizations once\nhunted in these now barren areas.\n3)   The huge discoveries of oil and gas in the\nArabian Peninsula.  Oil is the remains of dead microscopic plants and animals that\nlived in oceans, rivers or lakes millions of years ago.  The lack of oxygen\nenabled the dead microorganisms to maintain their hydro-carbon bonds which is\nneeded for the formation of oil and gas.  River basins in particular have low\noxygen levels due to constricted water circulation making them the optimum\nplace for the formation of oil and gas.  Heat and pressure and the passing of millions\nof years then caused the formation of oil and gas.\n[6]\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab\nEmirates, as well as other countries in the Arabian Peninsula need no\nintroduction when it comes to their proven oil reserves.  Remarkably the oil\nfields in the Arabian Peninsula are both offshore and onshore (over land; not\nsea).  The legendary Ghawar field in eastern Saudi Arabia is the largest oil\nfield in the world (in proven reserves), has been operating since the 1950’s,\nhas an estimated 70 billion barrels of remaining reserves, and remarkably\ngeographically it is located onshore in both the Empty Quarter and the Arabian\nDesert.  Likewise, the Burgan field in Kuwait is the 2\nnd\nlargest oil\nfield in the world and is also located onshore within the Arabian Desert.  The\ndiscovery of such onshore oil fields means that for millions of years, even\nbefore the last ice age started, the Arabian Peninsula was not the dry barren\nland it is today, instead was a paradise of lakes, rivers and river basins.\n4)   Satellite images taken from space have\nconfirmed that the Arabian Peninsula once had a totally different geography and\nclimate.  The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage reported that\nin the 1990’s Landsat provided imagery of eastern and southern parts of Saudi\nArabia, including the Empty Quarter.  The satellite images revealed old trade\nroutes, river paths and valleys; all of which are now covered by sand dunes.\nIn conclusion, geological and archeological discoveries confirm\nthe saying of the Prophet Muhammad, that the Arabian Peninsula was once full of\nmeadows and rivers; a fact that Prophet Muhammad could not have known by\nhimself except through revelation from God Almighty.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh Muslim\n, Book # 05, Hadeeth # 2208\n[2]\nElizabeth Howell, August 2013, The 10 Biggest Deserts on Earth,\nLive Science\n,\nRetrieved from\nhttps://www.livescience.com/38592-biggest-deserts.html\n[3]\nKim Ann Zimmermann, August 2017, Pleistocene Epoch: Facts about the Last Ice\nAge,\nLive Science Contributor\n, Retrieved from\nhttps://www.livescience.com/40311-pleistocene-epoch.html\n[4]\nKim Ann Zimmermann, August 2017, Pleistocene Epoch: Facts about the Last Ice\nAge,\nLive Science Contributor\n, Retrieved from\nhttps://www.livescience.com/40311-pleistocene-epoch.html\n[5]\nHabib Toumi, September 2018, Ancient Saudi Arabia was once lush and green,\nGulf\nNews\n, Retrieved from\nhttps://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/ancient-saudi-arabia-was-once-lush-and-green-1.2153218\n[6]\nRoger N. \nAnderson,\nWhy is oil usually found in deserts and arctic areas?\nScientific\nAmerican\n,\nRetrieved from\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-oil-usually-found",

    "content": "Preliminary Issues\nThe Bible is the sacred scripture of Judaism and\nChristianity.  The Christian Bible consists of the Old Testament and the New\nTestament, with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox versions of the Old\nTestament being slightly larger because of their acceptance of certain books not\naccepted as scripture by Protestants.  The Jewish Bible includes only the books\nknown to Christians as the Old Testament.  Furthermore, the arrangements of the\nJewish and Christian canons differ considerably.\n[1]\nProphet Muhammad has been prophesized in both the Old Testament and the New\nTestament.\nJesus and the Apostles are believed to have\nspoken Aramaic.  Aramaic continued in wide use until about AD 650, when it was\nsupplanted by Arabic.\n[2]\nThe\npresent day Bible is not, however, based on the Aramaic manuscripts, but on\nGreek and Latin versions.\nQuoting the Bible prophecies does not entail\nthat Muslims accept the present day Bible in its entirety as God’s revelation. \nFor the Islamic belief on previous scriptures, please click\nhere\n.\nIt is not a pre-condition of acceptance that a\nprophet be foretold by an earlier prophet.  Moses was a prophet to Pharaoh even\nthough he was not prophesized by anyone before him.  Abraham was God’s prophet\nto Nimrod, yet no one prophesized his coming.  Noah, Lot, and others were true\nprophets of God, yet they were not foretold.  The evidence of a prophet’s truth\nis not limited to old prophecies, but it includes the actual message brought by\nhim, miracles and more.\nDiscussing prophecies is a delicate matter.  It\nrequires sifting through Bible versions and translations, recently discovered\nmanuscripts and searching out Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic words and\ninvestigating them.  The task becomes especially difficult when: prior to the\nprinting press (15th century), all copies of Bibles show textual variations.\n[3]\nThis is not an easy subject for lay people.  For this reason, the best\ntestimony comes from ancient and modern experts in the area who acknowledged\nthe prophecies.\nWe have records of early Jews and Christians, both\nmonks and rabbis, who witnessed that Muhammad was the fulfillment of specific Bible\nprophecies.  The following are some examples of these people.\nThe Awaited Prophet\nPre-Islam Jews and Christians of Arabia were\nawaiting a prophet.  Before the appearance of Muhammad, Arabia was home to\nJews, Christians, and pagan Arabs who, on occasion, went to war with each\nother.  The Jews and Christians would say: The time has come for the\nunlettered prophet to appear who will revive the religion of Abraham.  We will\njoin his ranks and wage fierce war against you.  When Muhammad actually\nappeared, some of them believed in him, and some refused.  This is why God\nrevealed:\nAnd when there came to them a Book [Quran] from God\nconfirming that which was with them – although before they used to pray for\nvictory against those who disbelieved – but [then] when there came to them that\nwhich they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of God will be upon\nthe disbelievers. (Quran 2:89)\nThe first witness was Buhaira, the Christian\nmonk, who recognized Muhammad’s prophethood when he was still young and told\nhis uncle:\n…a great fortune lies before your nephew,\nso take him home quickly.\n[4]\nThe second witness was Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a\nChristian scholar who died soon after a solitary meeting with Muhammad. \nWaraqah attested Muhammad was the Prophet of his time and received revelation\nexactly like Moses and Jesus.\n[5]\nThe Jews of Medina were anxiously awaiting the\narrival of a prophet.  The third and fourth witnesses were their two famous\nJewish rabbis, Abdullah ibn Salam and Mukhayriq.\n[6]\nThe sixth and seventh witnesses were also Yemeni\nJewish rabbis, Wahb ibn Munabbih, and Ka’b al-Ahbar (d. 656 CE).  Ka’b found\nlong passages of praise and the description of the Prophet prophesized\nby\nMosesin the Bible.\n[7]\nThe Quran states:\nIs it not a sign to them that the learned men of the\nChildren of Israel knew it (as true)?

    "content": "Deuteronomy 18:18  I (God) will raise them\nup a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee (Moses), and will put my\nwords in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.\nMany Christians believe this prophecy foretold\nby Moses to be in regards to Jesus.  Indeed Jesus was foretold in the Old\nTestament, but as will be clear, this prophecy does not befit him, but rather is\nmore deserving of Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him. \nMoses foretold the following:\n1.       The Prophet Will Be Like Moses\n.\nAreas of Comparison\nMoses\nJesus\nMuhammad\nBirth\nnormal birth\nmiraculous, virgin\n  birth\nnormal birth\nMission\nprophet only\nsaid to be Son of God\nprophet only\nParents\nfather & mother\nmother only\nfather & mother\nFamily Life\nmarried with children\nnever married\nmarried with children\nAcceptance by own\n  people\nJews accepted him\nJews rejected him\n[1]\nArabs accepted him\nPolitical Authority\nMoses had it (Num 15:36)\nJesus refused it\n[2]\nMuhammad had it\nVictory Over Opponents\nPharaoh drowned\nsaid to be crucified\nMeccans defeated\nDeath\nnatural death\nclaimed to be\n  crucified\nnatural death\nBurial\nburied in grave\nempty tomb\nburied in grave\nDivinity\nnot divine\ndivine to Christians\nnot divine\nBegan Mission at age\n40\n30\n40\nResurrection on Earth\nnot resurrected\nresurrection claimed\nnot resurrected\n2.       The Awaited Prophet will be from the\nBrethren\nof the Jews\nThe verse in discussion is explicit in saying\nthat the prophet will come amongst the Brethren of the Jews.  Abraham had two\nsons: Ishmael and Isaac.  The Jews are the descendants of Isaac’s son, Jacob. \nThe Arabs are the children of Ishmael.  Thus, the Arabs are the brethren of the\nJewish nation.\n[3]\nThe\nBible affirms:\n‘And he (Ishmael) shall dwell in the\npresence of all his brethren.’ (Genesis 16:12)\n‘And he (Ishmael) died in the presence of\nall his brethren.’ (Genesis 25:18)\nThe children of Isaac are the brethren of the\nIshmaelites.  Likewise, Muhammad is from among the brethren of the Israelites,\nbecause he was a descendant of Ishmael the son of Abraham.\n3.       God Will Put His Words in the Mouth of the\nAwaited Prophet\nThe Quran says of Muhammad:\nNeither does he speak out of his own desire: that\n[which he conveys to you] is but [a divine] inspiration with which he is being\ninspired. (Quran 53:3-4)\nThis is quite\nsimilar to the verse in Deuteronomy 18:18:\nI will raise\nthem up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,\nand will put my\nwords in his mouth\n; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command\nhim (Deuteronomy 18:18)\nThe Prophet\nMuhammad came with a message to the whole world, and from them, the Jews.  All,\nincluding the Jews, must accept his prophethood, and this is supported by the\nfollowing words:\nThe LORD thy\nGod will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,\nlike unto me; unto him ye shall hearken. (Deuteronomy 18:15)\n4.       A Warning to Rejecters\nThe prophecy continues:\nDeuteronomy 18:19  And it shall come to\npass, [that] whosoever will not hearken unto my\nwords\nwhich he shall speak in my name, I will require [it] of him. (in some\ntranslations: I will be the Revenger).\nInterestingly, Muslims begin every chapter of\nthe Quran in the name of God by saying:\nBismillah ir-Rahman ir-Raheem\n‘In the Name of God,\nthe Most-Merciful, the Dispenser of Grace.\nThe following is the\naccount of some scholars who believed this prophecy to fit Muhammad.\nThe First Witness\nAbdul-Ahad Dawud, the former Rev.  David Benjamin\nKeldani, BD, a Roman Catholic priest of the Uniate-Chaldean sect (read his\nbiography\nhere\n). \nAfter accepting Islam, he wrote the book, ‘Muhammad in the Bible.’  He writes\nabout this prophecy:\nIf these words do not apply to Muhammad, they\nstill remain unfulfilled.  Jesus himself never claimed to be the prophet\nalluded to.  Even his disciples were of the same opinion: they looked to the\nsecond coming of Jesus for the fulfillment of the prophecy (Acts 3: 17-24).  So\nfar it is undisputed that the first coming of Jesus was not the advent of the\nProphet like unto thee and his second advent can hardly fulfill the words. \nJesus, as is believed by his Church, will appear as a Judge and not as a\nlaw-giver; but the promised one has to come with a fiery law in his right\nhand.\n[4]\nThe Second Witness\nMuhammad Asad was born Leopold Weiss in July\n1900 in the city of Lvov (German Lemberg), now in Poland, then part of the\nAustrian Empire.  He was the descendant of a long line of rabbis, a line broken\nby his father, who became a barrister.  Asad himself received a thorough\nreligious education that would qualify him to keep alive the family’s\nrabbinical tradition.  He had become proficient in Hebrew at an early age and\nwas also familiar with Aramaic.  He had studied the Old Testament in the\noriginal as well as the text and commentaries of the Talmud, the Mishna and\nGemara, and he had delved into the intricacies of Biblical exegesis, the\nTargum.\n[5]\nCommenting on the verse of the Quran:\nand do not overlay the truth with falsehood, and do\nnot knowingly suppress the truth (Quran 2:42)\nMuhammad Asad writes:\nBy ‘\noverlaying the truth with falsehood’\nis meant the corrupting of the biblical text, of which the Quran frequently\naccuses the Jews (and which has since been established by objective textual\ncriticism), while the ‘\nsuppression of the truth’\nrefers to their\ndisregard or deliberately false interpretation of the words of Moses in the\nbiblical passage, ‘The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the\nmidst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken’ (Deuteronomy\n18:15), and the words attributed to God himself, ‘I will raise them up a\nprophet from among thy brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his\nmouth’ (Deuteronomy 18:18).  The ‘brethren’ of the children of Israel are\nobviously the Arabs, and particularly the musta’ribah (‘Arabianized’) group\namong them, which traces its descent to Ishmael and Abraham: and since it is\nthis group that the Arabian Prophet’s own tribe, the Quraish, belonged, the\nabove biblical passages must be taken as referring to his advent.\n[6]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nHe\n(Jesus) came unto his own, but his own received him not (John 1:11)\n[2]\nJohn\n18:36.\n[3]\n‘Muhammad:\nHis Life Based on the Earliest Sources’ by Martin Lings, p. 1-7.\n[4]\nIbid, p. 156\n[5]\n‘Berlin to Makkah: Muhammad Asad’s Journey into Islam’\nby Ismail Ibrahim Nawwab in the January/February 2002 issue of Saudi Aramco\nMagazine.\n[6]\nMuhammad Asad, ‘The Message of The Quran’ (Gibraltar:\nDar al-Andalus, 1984), p. 10-11.",

    "content": "John 14:16  And I will pray the Father,\nand he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.\n(\nAmerican Standard Version\n)\nIn this verse, Jesus promises that another Comforter\nwill appear, and thus, we must discuss some issues concerning this Comforter.\nThe Greek word paravklhtoß,\nho parakletos\n,\nhas been translated as ‘Comforter.’\nParakletos\nmore precisely means ‘one\nwho pleads another’s cause, an intercessor.’\n[1]\nThe\nho parakletos\nis a person in the Greek language, not an incorporeal\nentity.  In the Greek language, every noun possesses gender; that is, it is\nmasculine, feminine or neutral.  In the Gospel of John, Chapters 14, 15 and 16\nthe\nho parakletos\nis actually a person.  All pronouns in Greek must\nagree in gender with the word to which they refer and the pronoun he is used\nwhen referring to the\nparakletos\n.  The NT uses the word\npneuma\n,\nwhich means breath or spirit, the Greek equivalent of\nruah\n, the\nHebrew word for spirit used in the OT.\nPneuma\nis a grammatically neutral\nword and is always represented by the pronoun it.\nAll present day Bibles are compiled from\nancient manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the fourth century C.E.  No\ntwo ancient manuscripts are identical.\n[2]\nAll\nBibles today are produced by combining manuscripts with no single definitive\nreference.  The Bible translators attempt to choose the correct version.  In\nother words, since they do not know which ancient manuscript is the correct\none, they decide for us which version for a given verse to accept.  Take John\n14:26 as an example.  John 14:26 is the only verse of the Bible which\nassociates the\nParakletos\nwith the Holy Spirit.  But the ancient\nmanuscripts are not in agreement that the \nParakletos\n is the ‘Holy\nSpirit.’  For instance, the famous Codex Syriacus, written around the fifth\ncentury C.E., and discovered in 1812 on Mount Sinai, the text of 14:26 reads; Paraclete,\nthe Spirit; and not Paraclete, the\nHoly Spirit\n.\nWhy is it important?  It is significant because\nin biblical language a spirit, simply means a prophet.\nBeloved, believe not every spirit, but try the\nspirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into\nthe world.\n[3]\nIt is instructive to know that several biblical\nscholars considered\nparakletos\nto be an ‘independent salvific (having\nthe power to save) figure,’ not the Holy Ghost.\n[4]\nThe question, then, is: was Jesus’\nparakletos\n,\nComforter, a ‘Holy Ghost’ or a person - a prophet - to come after him?  To\nanswer the question, we must understand the description of\nho parakletos\nand see if it fits a ghost or a human being.\nWhen we continue reading beyond chapter 14:16\nand chapter 16:7, we find that Jesus predicts the specific details of the\narrival and identity of the\nparakletos\n.  Therefore, according to the\ncontext of John 14 & 16 we discover the following facts.\n1.      Jesus said the parakletos is a human being:\nJohn 16:13 He will speak.\nJohn 16:7 …for if I go not away, the\nComforter will not come unto you.\nIt is impossible that the Comforter be the Holy\nGhost because the Holy Ghost was present long before Jesus and during his\nministry.\n[5]\nJohn 16:13 Jesus referred to the paraclete as\n‘he’ and not ‘it’ seven times, no other verse in the Bible contains seven\nmasculine pronouns.  Therefore,\nparaclete\nis a person, not a ghost.\n2.      Jesus is called a parakletos:\nAnd if any man sin, we have an advocate (parakletos)\nwith the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. (1 John 2:1)\nHere we see that\nparakletos is a physical and human intercessor.\n3.      The Divinity of Jesus a later innovation\nJesus was not accepted as divine until the\nCouncil of Nicea, 325 CE, but everyone, except Jews, agree he was a prophet of\nGod, as indicated by the Bible:\nMatthew 21:11 ...This is Jesus the prophet\nof Nazareth of Galilee.\nLuke 24:19 ...Jesus of Nazareth, which was\na prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.\n4.      Jesus prayed to God for another parakletos:\nJohn 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and\nhe shall give you another parakletos.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nVine’s\nExpository Dictionary of New Testament Words.\n[2]\nBesides\nthe larger discrepancies, such as these, there is scarcely a verse in which\nthere is not some variation of phrase in some copies [of the ancient\nmanuscripts from which the Bible has been collected]. No one can say that these\nadditions or omissions or alterations are matters of mere indifference.  ‘Our\nBible and the Ancient Manuscripts,’ by Dr. Frederic Kenyon, Eyre and\nSpottiswoode, p. 3\n.\n[3]\n1\nJohn 4: 1-3\n[4]\n‘...Christian\ntradition has identified this figure (Paraclete) as the Holy Spirit, but\nscholars like Spitta, Delafosse, Windisch, Sasse, Bultmann, and Betz have\ndoubted whether this identification is true to the original picture and have\nsuggested that the Paraclete was once an independent salvific figure, later\nconfused with the Holy Spirit.  ‘the Anchor Bible, Doubleday & Company,\nInc, Garden City, N.Y. 1970, Volume 29A, p. 1135.\n[5]\nGenesis 1: 2, 1\nSamuel 10: 10, 1 Samuel 11: 6, Isaiah 63: 11, Luke 1: 15, Luke 1: 35, Luke 1:\n41, Luke 1: 67, Luke 2: 25, Luke 2: 26, Luke 3:22, John 20: 21-22.",

    "content": "5.      Jesus describes the function of the other Parakletos:\nJohn 16:13 He will guide you into all the\ntruth.\nGod says in the Quran of Muhammad:\nO mankind!  The Messenger has now come unto you with\nthe truth from your Lord: believe, then, for your own good!... (Quran 4:170)\nJohn 16:14 He will glorify Me.\nThe\nQuran brought by Muhammad glorifies Jesus:\n…who shall become known as the Christ Jesus, son of\nMary, of great honor in this world and in the life to come, and [shall be] of\nthose who are drawn near unto God. (Quran 3:45)\nMuhammad also glorified Jesus:\nWhoever testifies that none deserves\nworship except God, who has no partner, and that Muhammad is His servant and\nMessenger, and that Jesus is the servant of God, His Messenger, and His Word\nwhich He bestowed in Mary, and a spirit created from Him, and that Paradise is\ntrue, and that Hell is true, God will admit him into Paradise, according to his\ndeeds. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nJohn 16:8 he will convince the world of\nits sin, and of God’s righteousness, and of the coming judgment.\nThe Quran announces:\nIndeed, they have disbelieved who say, ‘God is the\nChrist, son of Mary’ - seeing that the Christ [himself] said, ‘O Children of Israel!  Worship God [alone], who is my Lord as well as your Lord.’ ‘Indeed, whoever\nascribes divinity to any being beside God, unto him will God deny paradise, and\nhis goal shall be the fire: and there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers!’\n(Quran 5:72)\nJohn 16:13 he shall not speak of himself;\nbut whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak.\nThe\nQuran says of Muhammad:\nNeither does he speak out of his own desire: that\n[which he conveys to you] is but [a divine] inspiration with which he is being\ninspired. (Quran 53:3-4)\nJohn 14:26 and bring all things to your\nremembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\nThe words of the Quran:\n…while the Messiah had said, ‘O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.’ (Quran 5:72)\n…reminds people of the first and greatest\ncommand of Jesus they have forgotten:\nThe first of all the commandments is, ‘Hear,\nO Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.’ (Mark 12:29)\nJohn 16:13 and He will disclose to you\nwhat is to come.\nThe Quran states:\nThat is from the news of the unseen which We reveal,\n[O Muhammad], to you… (Quran 12:102)\nHudhaifa, a disciple of Prophet Muhammad, tells\nus:\nThe Prophet once delivered a speech in\nfront of us wherein he left nothing but mentioned everything that would happen\ntill the Hour (of Judgment). (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nJohn 14:16 that he may abide with you for\never.\n…meaning his original teachings will remain\nforever.  Muhammad was God’s last prophet to humanity.\n[1]\nHis\nteachings are perfectly preserved.  He lives in the hearts and minds of his\nadoring followers who worship God in his exact imitation.  No man, including Jesus\nor Muhammad, has an eternal life on earth.\nParakletos\nis not an\nexception either.  This cannot be an allusion to the Holy Ghost, for present\nday creed of the Holy Ghost did not exist until the Council of Chalcedon, in 451\nCE, four and half centuries after Jesus.\nJohn 14:17 he will be the spirit of truth\n…meaning he will be true prophet, see 1 John 4:\n1-3.\nJohn 14:17 the world neither sees him...\nMany people in the world today do not know\nMuhammad.\nJohn 14:17 ...nor knows him\nFewer people recognize the real Muhammad, God’s\nProphet of Mercy.\nJohn 14:26 the Advocate (parakletos)\nMuhammad will be the advocate of humanity at\nlarge and of sinful believers on Judgment Day:\nPeople will look for those who can intercede on\ntheir behalf to God to reduce the distress and suffering on Day of Judgment. \nAdam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus will excuse themselves.\nThen they will come to our Prophet and he will\nsay, I am the one who is able.  So he will intercede for the people in the Great\nPlain of Gathering, so judgment may be passed.  This is the ‘Station of Praise’\nGod promises Him in the Quran:\n…It may be that your Lord will raise you to Station\nof Praise (the honor of intercession on the Day of Resurrection) (Quran 17:79)\n[2]\nProphet Muhammad said:\nMy intercession will be for those of my\nnation who committed major sins. (\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\nI shall be the first intercessor in Paradise. (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nSome Muslim scholars suggest what Jesus actually\nsaid in Aramaic represents more closely the Greek word\nperiklytos\nwhich\nmeans the ‘admired one.’ In Arabic the word ‘Muhammad’ means the ‘praiseworthy,\nadmired one.’ In other words,\nperiklytos\nis Muhammad in Greek.  We\nhave two strong reasons in its support.  First, due to several documented cases\nof similar word substitution in the Bible, it is quite possible that both words\nwere contained in the original text but were dropped by a copyist because of\nthe ancient custom of writing words closely packed, with no spaces in between. \nIn such a case the original reading would have been, and He will give you\nanother comforter (\nparakletos\n), the admirable one (\nperiklytos\n).  Second,\nwe have the reliable testimony of at least four Muslim authorities from\ndifferent eras who ascribed ‘admired, praised one’ as a possible meaning of the\nGreek or Syriac word to Christians scholars.\n[3]\nThe following are some who attest that the\nParaclete is indeed an allusion to Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God\nbe upon him:\nThe First Witness\nAnselm Turmeda (1352/55-1425 CE), a priest and\nChristian scholar, was a witness to the prophecy.  After accepting Islam he\nwrote a book,\nTuhfat al-arib fi al-radd ‘ala Ahl al-Salib.\nThe Second Witness\nAbdul-Ahad Dawud, the former Rev. David Abdu\nBenjamin Keldani, BD, a Roman Catholic priest of the Uniate-Chaldean sect.\n[4]\nAfter\naccepting Islam, he wrote the book, ‘Muhammad in the Bible.’  He writes in this\nbook:\nThere is not the slightest doubt that by Periqlyte,\nProphet Muhammad, i.e. Ahmad, is intended.\nThe Third Witness\nA synopsis of the life of Muhammad Asad has\nalready been given above.  Commenting on the verse:\n…an apostle who shall come after me, whose name shall\nbe Ahmad (Quran 61:6)\n…where Jesus predicts the coming of Muhammad,\nAsad explains that the word Parakletos:\n…is almost certainly a corruption of Periklytos\n(‘the Much-Praised’), an exact Greek translation of the Aramaic term or name\nMawhamana.  (It is to be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used in\nPalestine at the time of, and for some centuries after, Jesus and was thus\nundoubtedly the language in which the original - now lost - texts of the\nGospels were composed.) In view of the phonetic closeness of Periklytos and\nParakletos it is easy to understand how the translator - or, more probably, a\nlater scribe - confused these two expressions.  It is significant that both the\nAramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have the same meaning as the two\nnames of the Last Prophet, Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from\nthe Hebrew verb hamida (‘he praised’) and the Hebrew noun hamd (‘praise’).\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nQuran 33:40\n.\n[2]\nSee\nalso\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[3]\n‘Sirat Rasul Allah,’ by Ibn Ishaq\n(85-151 CE)p, 103.  ‘Bayn al-Islam wal-Masihiyya: Kitab ‘Abi Ubaida al-Khazraji\n,’ p. 220-221 by Abu Ubaida al-Khazraji (1146-1187 CE) p. 220-221.  ‘Hidaya\ntul-Hayara,’ by Ibn ul-Qayyim, p. 119. ‘al-Riyadh al-Aniqa,’ by al-Suyuti, p.\n129.\n[4]\nRead his biography here: (http://www.muhammad.net/biblelp/bio_keldani.html.)",

    "content": "The Glorious Quran, the Muslims’ religious Scripture, was\nrevealed in Arabic to the Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God\nbe upon him, through the angel Gabriel.  The revelation occurred piecemeal,\nover a period of twenty-three years, sometimes in brief verses and sometimes in\nlonger chapters.\n[1]\nThe Quran (lit. a “reading” or “recitation”) is distinct\nfrom the recorded sayings and deeds (Sunnah) of the Prophet Muhammad, which are\ninstead preserved in a separate set of literature collectively called the “Ahadeeth”\n(lit. “news”; “report”; or “narration”).\nUpon receiving revelation, the Prophet engaged himself\nin the duty of conveying the message to his Companions through reciting the\nexact words he heard in their exact order.  This is evident in his inclusion of\neven the words of God which were directed specifically to him, for example: “Qul”\n(“Say [to the people, O Muhammad]”).  The Quran’s rhythmic style and eloquent\nexpression make it easy to memorize.  Indeed, God describes this as one of its\nessential qualities for preservation and remembrance (Q. 44:58; 54:17, 22, 32, 40),\nparticularly in an Arab society which prided itself on orations of lengthy\npieces of poetry.  Michael Zwettler notes that:\n“in ancient times, when writing was scarcely used,\nmemory and oral transmission was exercised and strengthened to a degree now\nalmost unknown.”\n[2]\nLarge portions of the revelation were thus easily memorized\nby a large number of people in the community of the Prophet.\nThe Prophet encouraged his Companions to learn each\nverse that was revealed and transmit it to others.\n[3]\nThe Quran was also required to be recited regularly as an act of worship,\nespecially during the daily meditative prayers (salah).  Through these means,\nmany repeatedly heard passages from the revelation recited to them, memorized\nthem and used them in prayer.  The entire Quran was memorized verbatim (word\nfor word) by some of the Prophet’s Companions.  Among them were Zaid ibn\nThabit, Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Muadh ibn Jabal, and Abu Zaid.\n[4]\nNot only were the words of the Quran memorized, but also\ntheir pronunciation, later which formed into a science in itself called Tajweed. \nThis science meticulously elucidates how each letter is to be pronounced, as\nwell as the word as a whole, both in context of other letters and words.  Today,\nwe can find people of all different languages able to recite the Quran as if\nthey are Arabs themselves, living during the time of the Prophet.\nFurthermore, the sequence or order of the Quran was\narranged by the Prophet himself and was also well-known to the Companions.\n[5]\nEach Ramadan, the Prophet would repeat after the angel Gabriel (reciting) the\nentire Quran in its exact order as far as it had been revealed, while in the\npresence of a number of his Companions.\n[6]\nIn\nthe year of his death, he recited it twice.\n[7]\nThereby, the order of verses in each chapter and the order of the chapters\nbecame reinforced in the memories of each of the Companions present.\nAs the Companions spread out to various provinces with\ndifferent populations, they took their recitations with them in order to\ninstruct others.\n[8]\nIn\nthis way, the same Quran became widely retained in the memories of many people\nacross vast and diverse areas of land.\nIndeed, memorization of the Quran emerged into a\ncontinuous tradition across the centuries, with centers/schools for\nmemorization being established across the Muslim world.\n[9]\nIn these schools, students learn and memorize the Quran along with its\nTajweed, at the feet of a master who in turn acquired the knowledge from his\nteacher, an ‘un-broken chain’ going all the way back to the Prophet of God. \nThe process usually takes 3-6 years.  After mastery is achieved and the\nrecitation checked for lack of errors, a person is granted a formal license\n(ijaza) certifying he has mastered the rules of recitation and can now recite\nthe Quran the way it was recited by Muhammad, the Prophet of God.\nThe image is a typical license (\nijaza\n) issued at the\nend of perfecting Quran recitation certifying a reciter’s unbroken chain of\ninstructors going back to the Prophet of Islam.  The above image is the\nijaza\ncertificate of Qari Mishari ibn Rashid al-Afasy, well known reciter from Kuwait, issued by Sheikh Ahmad al-Ziyyat.  Image courtesy of (http://www.alafasy.com.)\nA.T. Welch, a non-Muslim orientalist, writes:\n“For Muslims the Quran is much more than scripture or\nsacred literature in the usual Western sense.  Its primary significance for the\nvast majority through the centuries has been in its oral form, the form in\nwhich it first appeared, as the “recitation” chanted by Muhammad to his\nfollowers over a period of about twenty years… The revelations were memorized\nby some of Muhammad’s followers during his lifetime, and the oral tradition\nthat was thus established has had a continuous history ever since, in some ways\nindependent of, and superior to, the written Quran… Through the centuries the\noral tradition of the entire Quran has been maintained by the professional\nreciters (qurraa).  Until recently, the significance of the recited Quran has\nseldom been fully appreciated in the West.”\n[10]\nThe Quran is perhaps the only book, religious or\nsecular, that has been memorized completely by millions of people.\n[11]\nLeading orientalist Kenneth Cragg reflects that:\n“…this phenomenon of Quranic recital means that the text\nhas traversed the centuries in an unbroken living sequence of devotion.  It\ncannot, therefore, be handled as an antiquarian thing, nor as a historical\ndocument out of a distant past.  The fact of hifdh (Quranic memorization) has\nmade the Quran a present possession through all the lapse of Muslim time and\ngiven it a human currency in every generation, never allowing its relegation to\na bare authority for reference alone.”\n[12]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nMuhammad Hamidullah, Introduction to Islam, London: MWH Publishers, 1979, p.17.\n[2]\nMichael Zwettler, The Oral Tradition of Classical Arabic Poetry, Ohio State\nPress, 1978, p.14.\n[3]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\nVol.6, Hadith No.546.\n[4]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\nVol.6, Hadith No.525.\n[5]\nAhmad von Denffer, Ulum al-Quran, The Islamic Foundation, UK, 1983, p.41-42; Arthur Jeffery, Materials for the History of the Text of the Quran, Leiden: Brill, 1937, p.31.\n[6]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\nVol.6, Hadith No.519.\n[7]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\nVol.6, Hadith Nos.518\n& 520.\n[8]\nIbn\nHisham, Seerah al-Nabi, Cairo, n.d., Vol.1, p.199.\n[9]\nLabib as-Said, The Recited Koran, translated by Morroe Berger, A.

    "content": "The entire Quran was however also recorded in writing at\nthe time of revelation from the Prophet’s dictation, may the mercy and\nblessings of God be upon him, by some of his literate companions, the most\nprominent of them being Zaid ibn Thabit.\n[1]\nOthers among his noble scribes were Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn Mas’ud, Mu’awiyah ibn\nAbi-Sufyan, Khalid ibn Al-Waleed and Az-Zubayr ibn Al-Awwam.\n[2]\nThe verses were recorded on leather, parchment, scapulae (shoulder bones of\nanimals) and the stalks of date palms.\n[3]\nThe codification of the Quran (i.e. into a ‘book form’)\nwas done soon after the Battle of Yamamah (11AH/633CE), after the Prophet’s\ndeath, during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr.  Many companions became martyrs at\nthat battle, and it was feared that unless a written copy of the entire\nrevelation was produced, large parts of the Quran might be lost with the death\nof those who had memorized it.  Therefore, at the suggestion of Umar to collect\nthe Quran in the form of writing, Zaid ibn Thabit was requested by Abu Bakr to\nhead a committee which would gather together the scattered recordings of the Quran\nand prepare a mushaf - loose sheets which bore the entire revelation on them.\n[4]\nTo safeguard the compilation from errors, the committee accepted only material\nwhich had been written down in the presence of the Prophet himself, and which\ncould be verified by at least two reliable witnesses who had actually heard the\nProphet recite the passage in question\n[5]\n.  Once\ncompleted and unanimously approved by the Prophet’s Companions, these sheets\nwere kept with the Caliph Abu Bakr (d. 13AH/634CE), then passed on to the\nCaliph Umar (13-23AH/634-644CE), and then Umar’s daughter and the Prophet’s\nwidow, Hafsah\n[6]\n.\nThe third Caliph Uthman (23AH-35AH/644-656CE) requested\nHafsah to send him the manuscript of the Quran which was in her safekeeping,\nand ordered the production of several bounded copies of it (masaahif,\nsing\n.\nmushaf).  This task was entrusted to the Companions Zaid ibn Thabit, Abdullah\nibn Az-Zubair, Sa’eed ibn Al-’As, and Abdur-Rahman ibn Al-Harith ibn Hisham.\n[7]\nUpon completion (in 25AH/646CE), Uthman returned the original manuscript to\nHafsah and sent the copies to the major Islamic provinces.\nA number of non-Muslim scholars who have studied the\nissue of the compilation and preservation of the Quran also have stated its\nauthenticity.  John Burton, at the end of his substantial work on the Quran’s\ncompilation, states that the Quran as we have it today is:\n“…the text which has come down to us in the form in\nwhich it was organized and approved by the Prophet…. What we have today in our\nhands is the mushaf of Muhammad.\n[8]\nKenneth Cragg describes the transmission of the Quran\nfrom the time of revelation to today as occurring in\n“an unbroken living\nsequence of devotion.”\n[9]\nSchwally\nconcurs that:\n“As far as the various pieces of revelation are\nconcerned, we may be confident that their text has been generally transmitted\nexactly as it was found in the Prophet’s legacy.”\n[10]\nThe historical credibility of the Quran is further\nestablished by the fact that one of the copies sent out by the Caliph Uthman is\nstill in existence today.  It lies in the Museum of the City of Tashkent in Uzbekistan, Central Asia.\n[11]\nAccording\nto Memory of the World Program, UNESCO, an arm of the United Nations, ‘\nit is\nthe definitive version, known as the Mushaf of Uthman.’\n[12]\nThis manuscript, held by the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan, is\nthe earliest existent written version of the Quran.  It is the definitive\nversion, known as the Mushaf of Othman.  Image courtesy of Memory of the World\nRegister, UNESCO.\nA facsimile of the mushaf in Tashkent is available at\nthe Columbia University Library in the US.\n[13]\nThis copy is proof that the text of the Quran we have in circulation today is\nidentical with that of the time of the Prophet and his companions.  A copy of\nthe mushaf sent to Syria (duplicated before a fire in 1310AH/1892CE destroyed\nthe Jaami’ Masjid where it was housed) also exists in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul\n[14]\n,\nand an early manuscript on gazelle parchment exists in Dar al-Kutub\nas-Sultaniyyah in Egypt.  More ancient manuscripts from all periods of Islamic\nhistory found in the Library of Congress in Washington, the Chester Beatty Museum in Dublin (Ireland) and the London Museum have been compared with those\nin Tashkent, Turkey and Egypt, with results confirming that there have not been\nany changes in the text from its original time of writing.\n[15]\nThe Institute for Koranforschung, for example, in the University of Munich (Germany), collected over 42,000 complete or incomplete ancient copies of\nthe Quran.  After around fifty years of research, they reported that there was\nno variance between the various copies, except the occasional mistakes of the\ncopyist which could easily be ascertained.  This Institute was unfortunately\ndestroyed by bombs during WWII.\n[16]\nThus, due to the efforts of the early companions, with God’s\nassistance, the Quran as we have it today is recited in the same manner as it\nwas revealed.  This makes it the only religious scripture that is still\ncompletely retained and understood in its original language.  Indeed, as Sir\nWilliam Muir states,\n“There is probably no other book in the world which has\nremained twelve centuries (now fourteen) with so pure a text.”\n[17]\nThe evidence above confirms God’s promise in the Quran:\n“Verily, We have revealed the Reminder, and verily We shall\npreserve it.” (Quran 15:9)\nThe Quran has been preserved in both oral and written\nform in a way no other book has, and with each form providing a check and\nbalance for the authenticity of the other.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nJalal al-Din Suyuti, Al-Itqan fee\n‘Uloom al-Quran, Beirut: Maktab al-Thiqaafiyya, 1973, Vol.1, p.41 & 99.\n[2]\nIbn Hajar al-’Asqalani,\nAl-Isabah fee Taymeez as-Sahabah, Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1978; Bayard Dodge, The\nFihrist of al-Nadeem: A Tenth Century Survey of Muslim Culture, NY: Columbia\nUniversity Press, 1970, p.53-63.

    "content": "Although it is proven that the text of the Quran has\nremained intact till today, how are we sure that the words actually originated from God and not some other source?  This takes us to look at the authenticity, authority, or source of the Quran.\nConcerning the authorship of the Quran, Muslims believe\nthat it was revealed verbatim (i.e. word for word) by God, to Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him.  Non-Muslims, however, who do not\nsupport this view, can have no differences with Muslims concerning the fact\nthat the Quran was at least first witnessed to be uttered by Muhammad, a Meccan Arab in the 7\nth\ncentury CE and, as proved above, there have been\nno changes to the records of his utterances since then.\nMuslims’ claim of “internal evidence” for the divine\nauthorship of the Quran, i.e. from statements to that effect in the Quran\nitself (e.g. Quran 4:82; 6:19; 6:92; 27:6; 45:2, etc.), is understandably\nlooked upon with skepticism, as nearly anyone can quote passages from his or\nher scripture that claim the scripture in question is revelation from God.  We\nare therefore forced by reason and objectivity to look elsewhere for “external\nevidence” of the Quran’s divine source or authority.\nThe simple proposed structure for the presentation of\nthis “external evidence” is an elimination process, where we get to the answer\nof the question – “Who is the author of the Quran?” – by eliminating all\nalternative answers to this question which are definitely implausible.  In\nother words, the definite or (at least) most probable author or source of the Quran\nis identified by eliminating unacceptable alternative candidates.\nThere are various contradictory views and opinions held\nby some non-Muslims as to the source of the Quran.  The following list of “possible”\nauthors reflects the main theories:\n1)    Muhammad.\n2)    Some other Arab poet(s), scholars, etc.\n3)    Some non-Arab scholars, or poets or religious\npersonalities.\n4)    Monks or Rabbis (i.e. from the Bible or\nJudeo-Christian sources).\n5)    Satan (or other deceitful “spirits” or “aliens”,\netc.).\n6)    God.\nWe may now proceed to examine from a closer study of the\nQuran and history how plausible these theories are.\nMuhammad: Unlettered and Had No Teachers\nThe fact that Muhammad could neither read nor write (Quran\n29:48) is well known and uncontested by even his non-Muslim contemporaries and\npresent day historians.  He had no schooling or teacher of any kind.  He had never been known to compose oral poetry or prose.  The Quran, with its\nall-embracing laws and freedom from all inconsistencies, has its greatness\nacknowledged even by non-Muslim scholars.\n[1]\nIts contents treat social, economic, political and religious legislation,\nhistory, views of the universe, living things, thought, human transactions,\nwar, peace, marriage, worship, business, and everything relating to life - with\nno contradicting principles.  The Quran has never been edited or revised as it was never in need of any revision or correction.  How were such vast subject\nareas expounded upon with such precision by a 7\nth\ncentury Arab with no formal education or even the ability to read what scant material there may have been in his environment on such topics?  Where and when has history ever produced an illiterate author of such a scripture?\nMuhammad’s Known Integrity\nMuhammad’s sincerity, truthfulness and integrity were so\nwell known that he was even nicknamed\n“Al-Ameen”\n(The Trustworthy) by\nhis pre-Islamic community.  Not a single lie is recorded against him, and many\nmodern Western Orientalists have themselves admitted that contrary to any\ndeliberate deception, that the Prophet had a profoundly sincere conviction that\nit was revealed to him by God Himself is undeniable.\n[2]\nIf his integrity had been in question, and he was\nsupposed to have been motivated by the desire for personal glory to produce the\nQuran, why then would he disclaim authorship and instead claim it was from God,\nespecially when the pagan Meccans had conceded that no one could produce such a\nscripture (Quran 2:23-24, 17:88, etc.), but only marvel at it?  His enemies\neven offered him kingship over Mecca and any riches he desired if only he would\nstop reciting.  If it was true that he desired his personal glory and\nleadership, why would he decline the offer when it was presented to him and\ninstead prefer a life of humility, simplicity, persecution, sanctions, and even\nhostile attack by those who felt threatened by the Message of One God?\nIn addition, how reasonable is it to believe that\nunlettered Muhammad would author the Quran for personal benefit and then within\nthe Quran correct and reprove himself?  For example:\n“He frowned and turned away when the blind man came to him…” (Quran\n80:1-2)\nAnd also,\n“…And you did fear men, though God is more deserving that you\nshould fear Him” (Quran 33:37)\nThere are other verse you may refer to, such as chapter18,verse\n23-24, and others.  Why would he embarrass himself when he could simply omit or\nfavorably modify such verses in the Quran?  They were certainly not to his\nadvantage if his goals were power and prestige.  The existence of such verses\nonly proves that Muhammad was indeed a truthful and sincere Messenger of God!\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSee Fredrick Denny, Islam, NY: Harper &\nRow, 1987, p.88; Dr. Maurice Bucaille, The Bible, the Quran and Science, Indianapolis: American Trust Publications, 1983, p.163; and H.A.R.

    "content": "The Style of the Quran\nThere is a world of difference between the style of the Quran\nand Muhammad’s own style as recorded in the books of Ahadeeth.  The differences\nbetween the two in every respect – style and contents – are immediately evident. \nThe sayings of Muhammad (Ahadeeth) are conversational, oratorical, and\nexpository, of a kind the Arabs were already familiar with.  By contrast, the\nstyle of the Quran is authoritative:\n“We created the heavens and the earth…” (Quran 15:85, 44:38,\n46:3, 50:38)\nAlso,\n“Say!...”\n[1]\nAlso,\n“… had it (the Quran) been from any other than God, they would\nhave found therein much discrepancies.” (Quran 4:82)\nAlso,\n“… Say then: ‘Bring a chapter like it and call, if you can, on\nother than God…’”(Quran 10:38)\nAlso,\n“… then bring a chapter like unto it… and if you can not — for\nsurely you cannot, then…” (Quran 2:23-24)\nWhich fallible human being would write a book and\nchallenge humanity to find discrepancies in it, as does the author of the Quran\n(Quran 4:82)?  Would any sensible student after writing an exam paper add a\nnote to the lecturer saying “Read my answers with care and find any\ndiscrepancies or mistakes in it if you can!”?  The style of the Quran is simply\nthat of the All-Knowing Creator.\nFurthermore, the Quran is a literary masterpiece of\nArabic which was and remains unrivaled in its eloquence.  Its rhythmic style,\nrhyme, near-haunting depth of expression, majesty, and\n“inimitable symphony,\nthe very sounds of which move men to tears and ecstasy”\n[2]\n,\nshook the foundations of a society which had prided itself on its oratory\nskills.  Contests were held every year in Mecca for who could recite the\nlongest and most eloquent pieces from memory.  When the Quran was revealed, all\nsuch contests were brought to a halt, as there was no more competition.\nLike the miracle of Moses’ stick turning into a real\nsnake which outdid the ability of all the Pharaoh’s magicians at a time when\nthe Egyptians were noted for their mastery of sorcery and magic, and the\nmiracle of Jesus’ healing of the blind and bringing the dead back to life which\noutdid the ability of all the doctors at a time when the Jews were noted for\ntheir mastery of medicine, the Quran was the Prophet Muhammad’s own miracle.\n[3]\nHow could such magnificent and unrivaled expressions emanate from a man who,\nfor 40 years, was never known for any such ability?\nSimilarities and Discrepancies between the Quran and the\nBible\nThe mere existence of similarities between any two books\nis insufficient to prove that one must have been copied from the other.  Both\ncould have drawn information from a third common source, thus accounting for\nsome similarities between them.  This, in fact, is the argument of the Quran\nthat God is the Source of all authentic revelation (Quran 4:47).\nSome scholars have noted that the only Christians the\nProphet, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him,, is recorded as having\nbeen personally introduced to prior to his mission did not spend long enough\ntime with him to teach him of their scripture, and no other historical record\nmentions anyone who taught the Prophet from among the Jews and Christian.\n[4]\nFurthermore, the Arabs of his time were very eager to discredit him.  Hence,\nif there was any secret teacher, he would most likely have been exposed by them\nthen.\nFurthermore, could the Quran have been copied from the\nBible if they exhibit serious creedal differences?  Regarding doctrines such as\nthe concepts of God and prophethood, sin and forgiveness, the Quran differs\nsignificantly with the Bible.  The Quran in fact addresses Jews and Christians\ndirectly when correcting what it states are corruptions in their own scriptures. \nInterestingly, Quranic revelations of doctrinal problems with Christianity were\nsent largely in the Meccan period, prior to the Prophet’s migration to Medina, where he would have encountered many more Jewish and Christian scholars.\nEven in the case of narration common to both scriptures,\nvital discrepancies can be observed.  For example, the Quran, unlike the Bible:\n— does not blame women for the mistake committed by Adam\nand Eve (may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him) in disobeying God in\nthe Garden of Eden. (Compare Genesis 3:12-17 with Quran 91:7-8 and 2:35-37);\n— emphasizes that Adam and Eve repented to God (Quran 7:23)\nand were forgiven by Him (Quran 2:37);\n— mentions that the eventual dwelling of Adam and Eve on\nEarth was already part of God’s plan even before He created them (Quran 2:30),\nand not a sort of punishment (Genesis 3:17-19).\nOther significant variations can be seen in the stories\nof Solomon\n[5]\n, Abraham\n[6]\n,\nIshmael and Isaac, Lot, Noah\n[7]\n, Moses and\nJesus\n[8]\n(may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him).\nThe Quran also mentions a good amount of historical\ninformation about which the Bible is completely silent.  From which portion of\nthe Bible were the following copied?\n·\nThe stories of the people of ‘Ad and Thamud, and\ntheir Prophets, Hud and Saleh.\n·\nThe dialogue between Prophet Noah  and his son\nbefore the flood (Quran 11:42-43).\n·\nThe dialogue between Abraham  and his father (Quran\n6:74), as well as between he and a king (Quran 2:258), and between he and his\npeople (Quran 22:70-102; 29:16-18; 37:83-98; 21:57).\n·\nThe mention of the city of Iram (Quran 89:7).\n·\nThe Pharaoh of the Exodus having drowned, with his\nbody preserved as a sign for people of future generations (Quran 10:90-92).\n·\nJesus’ miracles of speaking from the cradle (Quran 3:46),\nand his producing (by God’s will) a bird from clay (Quran 3:49), etc.\nFor further examples, see the following references from\nthe Quran: 21:69, 2:260, and 3:37.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThis is\nmentioned in too many places in the Quran to mention here. See. Quran 112,113,114\nfor an example (E).\n[2]\nMarmaduke\nPickthall, The Meaning of the Glorious Quran, New York: The Muslim World\nLeague, 1977, p.vii.\n[3]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\nVol.6, Hadeeth No.504;\nSaheeh Muslim\nVol.1, Hadeeth No.283.\n[4]\nBilal Philips, Usool at-Tafseer, Sharjah: Dar\nal-Fatah, 1997, p.127-128.\n[5]\neg. the Quran rejects that this Prophet was\never a worshipper of idols – compare Quran 2:102 with 1 Kings 11:4.\n[6]\neg. the Quran describes the account of the\nstory of God’s command to sacrifice his son as occurring in a dream with his\nson as a willing participant before being saved by God’s intervention, while\nthe Bible speaks of God speaking directly to him and his son as unaware of his\nplans - compare Quran 37:99-111 with Genesis 22:1-19\n[7]\nThe Bible describes the Great Flood as covering\nthe entire Earth whereas the Quran describes the flood as a local event only, a\ndescription which is more consistent which scientific evidence - compare Quran 25:37\nwith Genesis 7:23.\n[8]\nA critical difference is the Quran’s insistence\nthat Jesus was never truly crucified.",

    "content": "Quranic Teachings about Satan and about Morality\nSome claim that the Quran was the work of the devil.\n[1]\nLet us examine how much sense (or non-sense) this allegation makes.\nIf he authored or inspired the Quran, why would Satan\ncurse himself and call himself the worst enemy of man (Q.35:6; 36:60)?  Why\nwould Satan command that before reciting the Quran, one must first say:\n“…I seek refuge in God from Satan the accursed.” (Quran 16:98)\nHow could Satan so vehemently condemn himself?  Is it\nreally acceptable to common sense to hold the view that Satan would ask people\nto do good, to be moral and virtuous, to worship none but God, to not follow\nSatan or his whispers, and to avoid and struggle against evil?\nTo hold such a view is clearly repugnant to reason, as\nSatan has only undermined himself through this means if he is the author.  Even\nthe Bible attests:\n“And if Satan has risen up against himself and is\ndivided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.” (Mark 3:26)\n[2]\nThis argument applies to any “Satanic forces”, be they “evil\nspirits”, “deceitful aliens”, etc.\nThe Quran’s Factual Contents and Scientific Information\nWithin the Quran are recorded facts about ancient times\nthat were unknown to Muhammad’s contemporaries and even to historians in the\nfirst half of the 20\nth\ncentury.  In scores of verses, we also find\nreferences to scientific wonders, some only recently discovered or confirmed,\nregarding the universe, biology, embryology, astronomy, physics, geography,\nmeteorology, medicine, history, oceanography, etc.  Below are some examples of\nmodern scientific discoveries mentioned in the Quran.\n·\nThe Lost City of Iram.

 Is it even conceivable that any human being over\n1,400 years ago could have produced a scripture with such information in it,\nlet alone a person who had never been educated?\nAlthough the inability of man to encompass all the\nmysteries and complexity of creation is mentioned in the Quran (67:3-4), the\nrevelation nevertheless seems to point to various natural phenomena as if\nurging human beings to enquire and verify what is said – again, with such an\nattitude of confidence that one can only assume the author is indeed\nchallenging our disbelief.  To be generous to the skeptic, perhaps one or two\nof the scientific revelations were the result of nothing more than a good guess\nor coincidence, but how probable could it have been that they all were?\nComparing Quranic statements that deal with the physical\nuniverse with certain scientific notions leads us to discover profound\nsimilarities.  But, more notably, as Dr. Maurice Bucaille observes, the Quran\nis distinguished from all other works of antiquity that describe or attempt to\nexplain the workings of nature in that it avoids mistaken concepts.  For in the\nQuran, many subjects are referred to that have a bearing on modern knowledge\nwithout a single statement contradicting what has been established by\npresent-day science.\n[11]\nDr. Bucaille goes as far as to conclude his study with\nthe following remark:\n“In view of the level of knowledge in Muhammad’s day, it\nis inconceivable that many statements in the Quran which are connected with\nscience could have been the work of a man.  It is, moreover, perfectly\nlegitimate, not only to regard the Quran as an expression of Revelation, but\nalso to award it a very special place, on account of the guarantee of\nauthenticity it provides and the presence in it of scientific statements which,\nwhen studied today, appear as a challenge to explanation in human terms.”\n[12]\nConclusions\nIn examining the possible source of the Quran we have\ncovered the following points:\n·\nMuhammad’s being unlettered\n·\nMuhammad’s integrity\n·\nThe Style of the Quran\n·\nDiscrepancies between the Quran and the Bible\n·\nQuranic teachings about Satan and about morality,\nand\n·\nThe Quran’s factual contents and scientific\ninformation\nThese points were presented to aid us in our “elimination\nprocess” of unacceptable sources or authors of the Quran, as follows:\nMuhammad :\nWe might start by eliminating Muhammad\n from the list of possible authors of the Quran.  There is just no way that he could\nhave authored the Quran in view of points 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 presented above.\nOther Arab Poet(s), Scholar(s), etc.:\nWe can also\neliminate any other Arab from the list of possible authors in view of points 2,\n3 and 6 (at least).\nSome non-Arab:\nThe reasons for the elimination of\nany Arab from the list also eliminate any non-Arab scholar, poet or religious\npersonality.\nChristian Monks or Jewish Rabbis (i.e.\nJudeo-Christian sources):\nThis alternative source of the Quran is\nunreasonable in view of points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6.\nSatan (or other deceitful spirits or aliens, or\nanyone on his side, etc.):\nThis option is also unacceptable in view of the\npoints discussed, especially under 5.\nGod:\nIn the absence of any more acceptable\nalternative as source and author of the Quran, one is more or less forced by reason to accept the Quran for what it claims to be – revelation from God through His\nProphet Muhammad.  This position seems reasonable not just because it is the\nonly option that cannot be objectively eliminated, but because it is only reasonable to expect that a book with such qualities and contents would come from man’s\nCreator and Guide.  Of all the possible sources of the Quran, it is only the last alternative – God – who even claims in the Quran itself to be the author of the\nscripture, for the Quran is truly the spoken word of God.\nThe position, therefore, which holds that God is the\nauthor and source of the Quran still stands, and the challenge (or falsification\ntest, Q.4:82) remains open to anyone to disprove the Quran’s claim to being\nrevelation from God.  Having undertaken this task ourselves, the Muslim’s\ncontention that the Quran is the Word of God appears not just a product of\nblind faith but, in fact, a product of very sound and reasoned judgment in light of all the available evidence.  Indeed, after having assessed the evidence, it would be blind faith to contend otherwise!\nNote that the evidence for the Divine Authorship of the Quran\nis also evidence for the existence of the Divine.  God must exist, unless a\nmore reasonably acceptable author of the Quran can be found!\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSee Norman Daniel’s Islam and the West: the Making of an Image, UK: Edinburgh University Press, 1989, p.83, 94, etc.\n[2]\nCited in H.M.

    "content": "Who authored the Quran?  Someone must have produced it!  After all,\nhow many desert men have stood up in the history of man and given the world a\nbook like the Quran?  The book has amazing details of past nations, prophets,\nand religions as well as accurate scientific information unavailable at the\ntime.  What was the source of all this?  If we were to deny the divine origin\nof the Quran, we are left with only a few possibilities:\n- The Prophet Muhammad authored it himself.\n- He took it from someone else.  In this case,\nhe either took it from a Jew or a Christian or one of the foreigners in Arabia.  The Meccans did not bother to accuse him of having taken it from one of them.\nA brief response from God is:\nAnd they say, ‘Legends of the former peoples which he\nhas written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.’  Say, [O\nMuhammad], ‘It has been revealed by He who knows [every] secret within the\nheavens and the earth.  Indeed, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful.’ (Quran\n25:5-6)\nIt was well known to his detractors that\nMuhammad, who was raised among them, never learned how to read or write from\nthe time of his birth.  They knew whom he befriended and where he had traveled;\nthey acknowledged his integrity and honesty by calling him ‘Al-Ameen,’ the\nReliable, the Trustworthy, the Honest.\n[1]\nOnly in their revulsion against his preaching did they accuse him – and then it\nwas anything they could\ndream up: He was accused of being a sorcerer, a poet and even an\nimposter!  They could not make up their minds.  God says:\nLook how they strike for you comparisons; but they\nhave strayed, so they cannot [find] a way. (Quran 17:48)\nSimply, God is aware of what is in the heavens\nand the earth, He knows the past and thepresent, and reveals the truth to His prophet.\nCould Muhammad Have Authored It?\nIt is impossible that Muhammad could have authored\nthe Quran due to the following reasons:\nFirst, several occasions presented themselves\nwhere he could have fabricated revelation.  For example, after the first revelation\ncame, people awaited to hear more, but the Prophet did not receive anything new\nfor months.  The Meccans began making fun of him, ‘His Lord has abandoned\nhim!’  This continued until the 93rd chapter, Ad-Doha, was revealed.  The\nProphet could have compiled something and presented it as the latest revelation\nto end the mockery, but he did not.  Also, at one point during his prophethood,\nsome of the hypocrites accused his beloved wife Aisha of being unchaste.  The Prophet\ncould have easily fabricated something to free her of blame, but he waited for many\nexcruciating days, all spent in pain, mockery, and anguish, until revelation\ncame from God freeing her from the accusation.\nSecond, there is internal evidence within the\nQuran that Muhammad was not its author.  Several verses criticized him, and were\non occasion strongly worded.  How can an imposter prophet blame himself when it\nmay run him into the danger of losing the respect, perhaps following, of his\nfollowers?  Here are some examples:\nO Prophet!  Why do you prohibit [yourself from] what\nGod has made lawful for you, seeking the approval of your wives?  And God is\nForgiving and Merciful. (Quran 66:1)\n…while you concealed within yourself that which God\nis to disclose and you feared the people, while God has more right that you\nfear Him.. (Quran 33:37)\nIt is not for the Prophet and those who have believed\nto ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it\nhas become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire. (Quran 9:113)\nBut as for he who came to you striving [for\nknowledge] while he fears [God], from him you are distracted.  No!  Indeed,\nthey [these verses] are a reminder. (Quran 80:8-11)\nIf he were to hide anything, he would have hid\nthese verses, but he recited them faithfully.\nAnd he [Muhammad] is not a withholder of [knowledge\nof] the unseen.  And it [the Quran] is not the word of a devil, expelled [from\nthe heavens].  So where are you going?  It is nothing but a reminder to the\nworlds. (Quran 81:24-27)\nThe Prophet is cautioned, perhaps warned, in the\nfollowing verses:\nIndeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the\nBook in truth so you may judge between the people by that which God has shown\nyou.  And do not be an advocate for the deceitful.  And seek forgiveness of God. \nIndeed, God is ever Forgiving and Merciful.  And do not argue on behalf of\nthose who deceive themselves.  Indeed, God loves not the one who is a\nhabitually sinful deceiver.  They conceal [their evil intentions and deeds]\nfrom the people, but they cannot conceal [them] from God, and He is with them\n[in His knowledge] when they spend the night in such as He does not accept of\nspeech.  And God ever is encompassing of what they do,.  Here you are – those\nwho argue on their behalf in [this] worldly life – but who will argue with God\nfor them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will [then] be their representative? \nAnd whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of God\nwill find God Forgiving and Merciful.  And whoever earns [i.e., commits] a sin\nonly earns it against himself.  And God is ever Knowing and Wise.  But whoever\nearns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an innocent [person] has taken\nupon himself slander and manifest sin.  And if it was not for the favor of God\nupon you, [O Muhammad], and His mercy, a group of them would have determined to\nmislead you.  But they do not mislead except themselves, and they will not harm\nyou at all.  And God has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and has taught you\nthat which you did not know.  And ever has the favor of God upon you been\ngreat. (Quran 4:105-113)\nThese verses explain a situation in which a man\nfrom the Muslim inhabitants of Medina stole a piece of armor and hid itin the property of his Jewish\nneighbor.  When the owners of the armor caught up with himhe denied any wrongdoing, and the\narmor was discovered with the Jewish man.  He, however, pointed to hisMuslim neighbor, also denying\nhis involvement in the crime.  The people from the Muslim’s tribe went to the\nProphet to plead on hisbehalf,\nand the Prophet began to incline towards them till the above verses were\nrevealedclearing the\nJewish man of wrongdoing.  All this despite the Jew’s rejection of Muhammad’sprophethood!  The verses\ninstructed Prophet Muhammad himself not to side with thedeceitful!  The verses:\n…and do not be an advocate for the deceitful and seek\nforgiveness of God…and if it was not for the favor of God upon you, [O\nMuhammad], and His mercy, a group of them would have determined to mislead you.\nIf Muhammad himself authored the Quran, thus\nbeing a lying imposter, he would have made sure that there was nothing in\nexistence which could jeopardize the gaining of followers and supporters.  The\nfact that the Quran, on various occasions, reprimands the Prophet in certain\nissues in which he had made in incorrect judgment is in itself a proof that it\nwas not authored by him.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\n‘Muhammad: His Life\nBased on the Earliest Sources’ by Martin Lings, p. 34.",

    "content": "The Evidence\nInitially,\nthe Meccan unbelievers said Muhammad is the author of the Quran.  God responded\nto them:\nOr do they say, ‘He himself has composed this\n[message]’?  No, but they are not willing to believe!  But then, [if they deem\nit the work of a mere mortal,] let them produce another discourse like it - if\nwhat they say be true!  [Or do they deny the existence of God implicitly by\ndenying the fact of His revelation?]  Have they themselves been created without\nanything - or were they, perchance, their own creators? (Quran 52:33-35)\nFirst, God challenged them to produce ten chapters\nlike the Quran:\nOr they may say, ‘He forged it,’ Say, ‘Bring ye then\nten suras forged, like unto it, and call (to your aid) whomsoever you can,\nother than God! - If you speak the truth!’  If then they answer not your\n(call), know you that this revelation is sent down with the knowledge of God,\nand that there is no god but He!  Will you then submit (to Islam)? (Quran\n11:13-14)\nBut, when they were unable to meet the challenge\nof ten chapters, God reduced it to a single chapter:\nAnd if you are in doubt about what We have sent down\non Our slave, then produce a surah thereof and call upon your witnesses other\nthan God, if you should be truthful.  But if you do not – and you will never be\nable to – then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the\nunbelievers. (Quran 2:23-24)\nFinally, God foretold their eternal failure to\nmeet the divine challenge:\nSay: ‘If all mankind and all jinn\n[1]\nwould\ncome together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce its\nlike even though they were to exert all their strength in aiding one another!’\n(Quran 17:88)\nThe Prophet of Islam said:\nEvery Prophet was given ‘signs’ because of\nwhich people believed in him.  Indeed, I have been given the Divine Revelation\nthat God has revealed to me.  So, I hope to have the most followers of all the\nprophets on the Day of Resurrection. (\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n)\nThe physical miracles performed by the prophets were\ntime-specific, valid only for those who witnessed them, whereas the like of the\ncontinuing miracle of our Prophet, the Noble Quran, was not granted to any\nother prophet.  Its linguistic superiority, style, clarity of message, strength\nof argument, quality of rhetoric, and the human inability to match even its\nshortest chapter till the end of time grant it an exquisite uniqueness.  Those\nwho witnessed the revelation and those who came after, all can drink from its\nfountain of wisdom.  That is why the Prophet of Mercy hoped he will have the\nmost followers of all the prophets, and prophesized that he would at a time\nwhen Muslims were few, but then they began to embrace Islam in floods.  Thus,\nthis prophecy came true.\nExplanation of Quran’s Inimitability\nState of the Prophet Muhammad\nHe was an ordinary human being.\nHe was illiterate.  He could neither read nor\nwrite.\nHe was more than forty years old when he\nreceived the first revelation.  Until then he was not known to be an orator,\npoet, or a man of letters; he was just a merchant.  He did not compose a single\npoem or deliver even one sermon before he was chosen to be a prophet.\nHe brought a book attributing it to God, and all\nArabs of his time were in agreement it was inimitable.\nThe Challenge of the Quran\nThe Quran puts a challenge out to anyone who\nopposes the Prophet. The challenge is to produce a chapter (\nsurah\n)\nsimilar to it, even if it were to be a cooperative effort.  A person may summon\nall the help he can from the physical and spiritual realms.\nWhy this Challenge?\nFirst, Arabs were poets.  Poetry was their\nsupreme ornament and their most representative form of discourse.  Arabic\npoetry was rooted in the oral; it was a voice before it acquired an alphabet.  Poets\ncould compose intricate poems spontaneously and commit thousands of lines to\nmemory.  Arabs had a complex system of evaluating a poet and the poetry to meet\nrigid standards.  Annual competition selected the ‘idols’ of poetry, and they\nwere engraved in gold and hung inside the Kaaba, alongside their idols of\nworship.  The most skilled served as judges.  Poets could ignite wars and bring\ntruce between warring tribes.  They described women, wine, and war like no one\nelse.\nSecond, the opponents of the Prophet Muhammad\nwere strongly determined to quash his mission in any way possible.  God gave\nthem a non-violent approach to disprove Muhammad.\nInability to Meet the Challenge and its Consequences\nHistory is a witness that the pre-Islamic Arabs\ncould not produce a single chapter to meet the challenge of the Quran.\n[2]\nInstead of meeting the challenge, they chose violence and waged war against him. \nThey, of all people, had the ability and the motive to meet the Quranic\nchallenge, but could not do so.  Had they done so, the Quran would have proven\nfalse, and the man who brought it would have been exposed as a false prophet. \nThe fact that the ancient Arabs did not and could not meet this challenge is\nproof of Quran’s inimitability.  Their example is of a thirsty man next to a\nwell, the only reason he dies of thirst is if he was unable to reach the water!\nFurthermore, the inability of previous Arabs to\nmeet the challenge of the Quran implies later Arabs are less competent to meet\nthe challenge, due to their lack the mastery of classical Arabic that the previous,\n‘classical’ Arabs had.  According to linguists of the Arabic language, the Arabs\nbefore and during the time of the Prophet, in exclusion to subsequent generations,\nhad the most complete mastery of the Arabic language, its rules, meters, and\nrhymes.  Later Arabs did not match the mastery of classical Arabs.\n[3]\nLastly, the challenge is for Arabs and non-Arabs\nalike.  If the Arabs cannot meet the challenge, the non-speakers of Arabic cannot\nclaim to meet the challenge either.  Hence, the inimitability of the Quran is\nestablished for non-Arabs as well.\nWhat if someone were to say: ‘perhaps the\nchallenge of the Quran was met by someone in the time of the Prophet, but the\npages of history did not preserve it.’?\nSince the beginning,\npeople have reported important events to their succeeding generations,\nespecially in that which captures attention or what people are looking out for. \nThe Quranic challenge was well spread and well known, and had someone met it,\nit would have been impossible for it not to have reached us.  If it has been lost\nin the annals of history, then, for the sake of argument, it is also possible\nthat there was more than one Moses, more than one Jesus, and more than one\nMuhammad; perhaps many scriptures were also revealed to these imaginary\nprophets, and it is possible the world knows nothing about it!  Just like these\nsuppositions are unfounded historically, it is also unreasonable to imagine that\nthe Quranic challenge was met without it reaching us.\n[4]\nSecond, had they met the challenge, the Arabs\nwould have discredited the Prophet.  It would have been their biggest\npropaganda tool against him.  Nothing like this happened, instead, they chose\nwar.\nThe\nfact that no effort of the non-Muslim has succeeded in ‘producing a verse’ like\na verse of the Quran means that either no-one has taken the Quran seriously\nenough to make the effort, or that they made the effort, but were not\nsuccessful.  This shows the inimitability of the Quran, a unique and\neverlasting message.  The uniqueness of the Quran combined with the divine\nmessage it brings to mankind is a sure indication of the truth of Islam. In the\nface of this, every person is faced with one of the two choices.  He either\nopenly accepts the Quran is God’s Word .  In doing so he must also accept that\nMuhammad was sent by God and was His Messenger.  Or else he secretly knows the\nQuran is true, but he chooses in his heart to refuse it.  If the seeker is\nhonest in his seeking, he need but explore this question of its inimitability\nto nurture the inner certainty that he has really found the final truth in the\nreligion it predicates.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nInvisible\nbeings with parallel existence to humans.\n[2]\nThe\nfact is attested to by non-Muslim Orientalists.\n‘That the best of Arab writers has never\nsucceeded in producing anything equal in merit to the Quran itself is not\nsurprising…\n’ (E H Palmer (Tr.), The Quran, 1900, Part I, Oxford at\nClarendon Press, p. lv).\n‘…and no man in fifteen hundred years has\never played on that deep-toned instrument with such power, such boldness, and\nsuch range of emotional effect as Mohammad did…As a literary monument the Quran\nthus stands by itself, a production unique to the Arabic literature, having\nneither forerunners nor successors in its own idiom…’.’\n(H A R Gibb, Islam\n- A Historical Survey, 1980, Oxford University Press, p. 28).\nand Christian Arabs:\n‘Many Christian Arabs speak of its style\nwith warm admiration, and most Arabists acknowledge its excellence. When it is\nread aloud or recited it has an almost hypnotic effect that makes the listener\nindifferent to its sometimes strange syntax and its sometimes, to us, repellent\ncontent. It is this quality it possesses of silencing criticism by the sweet\nmusic of its language that has given birth to the dogma of its inimitability;\nindeed it may be affirmed that within the literature of the Arabs, wide and\nfecund as it is both in poetry and in elevated prose, there is nothing to compare\nwith it.’\n(Alfred Guillaume, Islam, 1990 (Reprinted), Penguin Books, pp.\n73-74)\n[3]\nRummani (d. 386 AH), a classical scholar, writes: ‘So\nif someone were to say: You rely in your argumentation on the failure of the\nBedouin Arabs, without taking into account the post-classical Arabs; yet,\naccording to you, the Quran is a miracle for all. One can find in the\npost-classical Arabs excellence in their speech, the following can be said in\nreply, The Bedouin had developed and had full command of the complete\ngrammatical structure of Arabic but among the post-classical Arabs there are\nnone who can use the full structure of the language. The Bedouin Arabs were\nmore powerful in their use of the full language. Since they failed in the\nimitation of the Quran, so the post-classical Arabs must fail to an even\ngreater extent.‘ (Textual Sources for the Study of Islam, tr. and ed. by\nAndrew Rippin and Jan Knappart)\n[4]\nThe argument was made by al-Khattabi (d.388 AH).",

    "content": "The Quran contains many prophecies that have been fulfilled, but in\nthis discussion, we will limit ourselves to only five.\n[1]\nThe first two prophecies are noteworthy: unlike any other world scripture, the\nQuran prophesizes its own preservation under divine care, and we will\ndemonstrate how it actually occurred.\nThe Protection of the Quran from Corruption\nThe Quran makes a claim no other religious text\nmakes, that God Himself will keep its text safe from alteration.  God says:\nBehold, it is We Ourselves who have gradually revealed\nthis reminder, and, behold, it is We who shall truly guard it [from all\ncorruption]. (Quran 15:9)\nThe Ease of Memorizing the Quran\nGod has made the Quran easy to memorize:\nAnd in truth We have made the Quran easy to remember;\nwho, then, is willing to take it to heart? (Quran 54:17)\nThe ease with which Quran is memorized is\ninimitable.  There is not a single scripture or religious text in the world\nthat is as easy to memorize; even non-Arabs and children commit it to memory\neasily.  The entire Quran is memorized by almost every Islamic scholar and\nhundreds of thousands of ordinary Muslims, generation after generation.  Almost\nevery Muslim has some portion of the Quran memorized to read in his prayers.\nThe Twofold Prophecy\nBefore the rise of Islam, the Romans and the\nPersians were two competing superpowers.  Romans were led by Heraclius (610–641\nCE), a Christian Emperor, whereas the Persians were Zoroastrians led by Khosrow\nParviz (reigned 590–628 CE), under whom the empire achieved its greatest\nexpansion.\nIn 614, the Persians conquered Syria and\nPalestine, taking Jerusalem, destroying the Holy Sepulcher and the ‘True Cross’\ncarried to Ctesiphon.  Then, in 619, they occupied Egypt and Libya.  Heraclius met them at Thracian Heraclea (617 or 619), but they sought to capture\nhim, and he rode madly back to Constantinople, hotly pursued.\n[2]\nThe Muslims were grieved by the Roman defeat as\nthey felt spiritually closer to Christian Rome than Zoroastrian Persia, but the Meccans were naturally buoyed up by the victory of pagan Persia.  To Meccans, the\nRoman humiliation was a sinister omen of the defeat of the Muslims at pagan\nhands.  At the time God’s prophecy comforted the faithful:\nThe Romans have been defeated - in a land close by;\nbut they, (even) after (this) defeat of theirs, will soon be victorious- within\nten years.  With God is the Decision, in the past and in the future: on that\nDay shall the believers rejoice with the help of God.  He helps whom He will,\nand He is the Mighty, the Most-Merciful. (Quran 30:2-5)\nThe Quran made a prophecy of two victories:\n(i)   The future Roman victory within ten\nyears over Persians, something unimaginable at the time\n(ii)  The joy of the faithful on a victory\nover the pagans\nBoth of these prophecies actually occured.\nIn 622, Heraclius left Constantinople as prayers\nrose from its many sanctuaries for victory over the Persian Zoroastrians and\nthe reconquest of Jerusalem.  He devoted the next two years to campaigns in Armenia.  In 627, he met the Persians near Nineveh.  There, he killed three Persian\ngenerals in single combat, killed the Persian commander, and scattered the\nPersian host.  A month later, Heraclius entered Dastagird with its stupendous\ntreasure.  Khosrow was overthrown by his son, who made peace with Heraclius.  Returning\nto Constantinople in triumph, Heraclius was hailed as a hero.\n[3]\nAlso, in the year 624 AH, Muslims defeated the\nMeccans in the first and decisive Battle at Badr.\nIn the words of an Indian scholar:\n…a single line of prophecy was related to four\nnations and the fate of two great empires.  All this proves the Holy Quran to\nbe the Book of God.\n[4]\nThe Prophecy of Pagan Defeat\nThe Quran predicted the defeat of unbelievers in\n  Mecca while Prophet Muhammad and his followers were still being persecuted by them:\nOr do they (the Meccan disbelievers) say: ‘We are a\ngreat multitude, and we shall be victorious?’  Their multitude will be\ndefeated, , and they shall turn their backs [in flight]! (Quran 54:45)\nThe prophecy was revealed in Mecca, but was fulfilled\nat the Battle of Badr, two years after the Prophet’s migration to the city of Medina.\nThe Fate of Specific Individuals\nWaleed ibn Mugheera was a staunch enemy who\nopenly ridiculed the Quran:\nThen said he: This is nothing but magic, derived\nfrom of old; this is nothing but the word of a mortal! (Quran 74:24-25)\nThe Quran prophesized he will never accept\nIslam:\nSoon will I cast him into Hell-Fire!  And what will\nexplain to thee what Hell-Fire is?  It leaves naught nor doesit spare aught. (Quran\n74:26-28)\nWaleed died in a state of disbelief as\nprophesized by the Quran.\nAlso, concerning Abu Lahab, a fiery opponent of\nIslam, the Quran foretold he will die opposing the religion of God:\nMay the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and [indeed] he has\nperished.  His wealth and gains will not profit him.  He will be plunged in\nflaming Fire. (Quran 111:1-3)\nSpecifically, three prophecies were made about\nAbu Lahab:\n(i)   The conspiracies of Abu Lahab against\nthe Prophet would not succeed.\n(ii)  His wealth and children would not benefit\nhim.\n(iii) He would die opposing God’s religion\nand enter the Fire.\nAbu Lahab also\ndied in a state of disbelief as prophesized by the Quran.  Had Waleed or Abu\nLahab\naccepted Islam even outwardly, they would have\ndisproved its prophecies and thus its heavenly source!\nIn addition, Abu Lahab had four sons, two of\nwhom died at a young age during his lifetime.  The other two sons and a daughter\nembraced Islam and frustrated his hopes!  Finally, he died of a plague; people\nwould not touch\nhis body out of fear of contamination and dumped mud and stones on him where he\ndied to\nmake it his grave.\nA key foundation to believing that a scripture\nis actually a revelation of God is internal truth, whether it be in regards to\noccurrences in the past, to come in the future, or in contemporary ages.  As\none can see, there are many prophecies mentioned in that which is to come, some\nof which were fulfilled in the Prophet’s lifetime, or have been fulfilled since\nhis death, while others are yet to appear.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nFor\nmore Quranic prophecies please see ‘Mercy For the Worlds,’ by Qazi Suliman\nMansoorpuri, vol.3, p. 248 - 313.\n[2]\nHeraclius.\n Encyclopædia Britannica from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service.\n(http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9040092)\n[3]\nHeraclius.  Encyclopædia Britannica from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium\nService.\n(http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9040092)\n[4]\n‘Mercy\nFor\nthe\nWorlds,’ by Qazi Suliman\nMansoorpuri, vol.3, p. 312.",

    "content": "The Quran is not only unique in the way in which it presents its\nsubject matter, but it is also unique in that it is a miracle itself.  By the\nterm “miracle,” we mean the performance of a supernatural or extraordinary\nevent which cannot be duplicated by humans.  It has been documented that\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, challenged\nthe Arabs to produce a literary work of a similar caliber as the Quran, but\nthey were unable to do so in spite of their well-known eloquence and literary\npowers.  The challenge to reproduce the Quran was presented to the Arabs and\nmankind in three stages:\nl.      The Whole Quran\nIn the Quran, God commanded the Prophet to challenge all\nof creation to create a book of the stature of the Quran:\n“Say: ‘If all mankind and the jinn would come together to\nproduce the like of this Quran, they could not produce its like even though\nthey exerted all their strength in aiding one another.’” (Quran 17:88)\n2.      Ten Chapters\nNext, God made the challenge ostensibly easier by asking\nthose who denied its divine origin to imitate even ten chapters of the Quran:\n“Or do they say that he has invented it?  Say (to them), ‘Bring\nten invented chapters like it, and call (for help) on whomever you can besides God,\nif you are truthful.” (Quran 11:13)\n3.      One Chapter\nThis final challenge was to produce even a single chapter\nto match what is in the Quran, whose shortest chapter, al-Kawthar, consists of\nonly three verses:\n“And if you all are in doubt about what I have revealed to My\nservant, bring a single chapter like it, and call your witnesses besides God if\nyou are truthful.” (Quran 2:23)\nThese challenges were not just empty words with no one\ncaring to prove them wrong.  Prophet Muhammad’s call to monotheism, to the\nabolition of idolatry in all its forms, and to the equality of slaves and their\nmasters threatened the whole socio-economic framework of Mecca society in\ngeneral, and the position of the ruling Quraishee tribe from which the Prophet\ncame in particular.  Mecca, the trading center of Arabia, as well as its\nspiritual center, desperately wanted to stop the spread of Islam.  Yet all that\nthe Prophet’s opponents had to do to crush the movement was to make up a single\nchapter like any one of those which the Prophet and his followers were reciting\nto the people.  A number of Quraishee orators and poets tried to imitate the Quran,\nbut they failed.  They then resorted to offering him vast amounts of wealth,\nthe position of king over them, and the most noble and beautiful of their women\nin exchange for his promise to stop inviting people to Islam.  He responded to\nthem by reciting the first thirteen verses of Chapter Fussilat, until they\nasked him to stop.\n[1]\nThe\nQuraish also resorted to torturing their slaves and relatives who had embraced Islam\nin a vain attempt to cause them to revert to paganism.  Later they organized an\neconomic boycott against the Prophet, his followers and the members of his\nclan, Banoo Haashim, in an attempt to starve them into submission.  But even\nthis plan eventually failed.  Finally, they plotted to kill him in his home by\nsending armed young men from each of the clans of Quraish in order that the\nguilt of his murder be shared by all the clans, making revenge by the Prophet’s\nclan impossible.\nHowever, God enabled the Prophet and his followers to\nflee Mecca and join a new band of converts who had arisen among the tribes of a\ncity to the north called Yathrib.  Islam spread rapidly through the clans of\nYathrib, and within a year Muslims became the city’s majority.  Prophet\nMuhammad was then made the ruler, and the name of the city was changed to Madinatun-Nabee\n(The City of the Prophet), which was then shortened to “Medina.” Over the next\neight years, the clans of Mecca and its neighboring lands mounted a series of\nunsuccessful battle campaigns against the emerging Muslim state in Medina, which ended with the Muslim invasion of Mecca itself.\nAll of this bloodshed could have been avoided if only\nthe Quraish and their allies had been able to produce a mere three lines of\npoetry or flowing prose similar to the shortest chapter of the Quran.  Hence,\nthere can be no doubt about the inimitability of the Quran’s literary style,\nabout the miracle of its rhyme and the marvel of its rhythm.\nIt has been suggested that the inimitability of the Quran\nis not necessarily unique, for great English poets like Shakespeare, Chaucer,\nor great poets in any language tend to have distinctly unique styles which set\nthem apart from their contemporaries.  However, if, for example, some leading\npoet of today were to make an in-depth study of Shakespeare’s writings and\nwrite a sonnet in Shakespeare’s style in old ink and on old paper, then claim\nthat he had discovered a lost poem of Shakespeare’s, the literary world would\nprobably accept this claim, even after careful study.  Thus, even the greatest\nof poets could be imitated, no matter how unique his style was, just as the\nfamous painters have been imitated.  [In fact, some English scholars consider\nmuch of what has been attributed to Shakespeare to have been written by his\ncontemporary, Christopher Marlowe.] The Quran, however, is way above this\nlevel, as attempts to forge chapters have been made throughout the ages, yet\nnone has withstood close scrutiny.  And, as was mentioned before, the incentive\nto imitate the Quran was more intense during the time of its revelation when\nliterally skills were at their peak than at any other time, yet there was no\nsuccessful attempt.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nCollected by al-Haakim, al-Bayhaqee, Aboo Ya’laa and Ibn Hishaam, and declared\nhasan by lbraaheem al-’Alee in Saheeh as-Seerah an-Nabaweeyah, p.64.",

    "content": "Many people misunderstand the Quran’s literary challenge\nto produce something like it.  Many people assume it simply means writing something\nas “good” as the Quran.\nBecause of this, many skeptics point out – and rightly\nso – that literary value judgments are highly subjective.  If someone says that\nhe thinks a certain selection of prose or poetry is better than the Quran, who\ncan argue with him?  Isn’t it really a matter of personal judgment and taste?  Who\nis to be the arbiter?\nThe Quran’s challenge, however, is not simply to write\nsomething of equal literary merit, but rather to produce something like the\nQuran.\nWe can see this in all the verses of challenge.  God\nsays:\n“Say (O Muhammad) if mankind and jinn were to come together to\nproduce something like this Quran, they would not be able to do so, even if\nthey were to help one another.” (Quran 17:88)\nGod says:\n“Or they say: ‘He has forged it.’  Say: ‘Then bring ten forged\nchapters like it and If then they do not answer you, know that it is sent down\nwith the Knowledge of God, besides Whom there is no other God.  Will you then\nbe Muslims?” (Quran 11:13)\nGod says:\n“Or do they say ‘He has forged it.’  Say: ‘Then bring a\nchapter like it and call whoever you can besides God if you are truthful’.”\n(Quran 10:38)\nGod says:\n“And if you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent\ndown to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call your witnesses\nbesides God if you be truthful.  If you do not do so – and you will never do so\n– then fear a fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for the disbelievers.”\n(Quran 2:23-24)\nTherefore, it is not simply a matter of quality – it\ndoes not even have to be of equal merit! Similarity is all that matters.  What\nis required by the challenge is to achieve at least a comparable degree of the\nliterary beauty, nobility, and sublimity of the Quran while at the same time\nemulating the Quran’s particular style.\nIt is possible to superficially mimic the style of the\nQuran, and many people have been successful in doing so – but all such attempts\nfrom the days of Musailimah to the present have proven to be silly and absurd,\nand have often invoked laughter and derision.  This is the unanimous consensus\nof everyone who has ever heard or read those attempts.\nIt is, likewise, possible for a person writing in Arabic\nto reach a great level of literary excellence and, in the most moving of poetry\nand prose, convey the noblest thoughts and sentiments – but nobody has ever\ndone so using the Quran’s particular style.\nAnd what an elusive style it has proven to be! The Quran\nis neither in Arabic prose nor in what is acknowledged as Arabic verse.  It is\nnot written in a combination of both prose and poetry, but in neither of those\nmodes.  It is unique.  At the same time, the Quran is internally consistent in\nmaintaining its unique style.\nOnly the Quran achieves the highest level of literary\nexcellence – so much so that it brings people to ecstasy and tears – while\nmaintaining this style.\nThis, then, is the acid test: Write something in the\nexact same style as the Quran and in doing so produce something of arguably\nsimilar quality and sublimity.\nStill, one could argue that the evaluation of the\nresults is still grounded in subjective literary tastes.  This is agreed.  However,\nthe second part of the challenge is to bring witnesses to attest to the quality\nof that evaluation, not just to stand there and make the claim.\nThroughout history, people have attempted to write in\nthe style of the Quran.  The results have always been so laughable that no one\nwould venture to say that he believes the effort equals the Quran in literary\nmerit.  The reason why no one would dare do so is not the fear of reprisal – as\nsome skeptics have suggested – but rather the fear of looking like a complete\nidiot.  One early example was:\nAl-Feel\nMal-Feel\nWa maa adraaka mal-feel\nLahu dhanabun radheel, wa khurtoomun taweel\n…which translates as:\nThe Elephant –\nWhat is the elephant?\nAnd what would have you know what the elephant is?\nIt has a scraggly tail and a very long trunk.\nWe can grant that this is a successful attempt at\nimitating the superficial style of the Quran.  It is clearly modeled after the\nopening verses of Surah al-Qaari`ah or Surah al-Haaqqah.  However, with such\nfare on offer, it is no surprise that people are unwilling to stake their\nreputation on attesting to its literary excellence.\nWe should pause to consider: What other literary style\ncan we think of which has produced an indisputably great work of literature but\nis at the same time guaranteed to bring the most wretched failure to anyone\nelse who tries his hand at it?\nGenerally, it is not a bad idea for a writer to emulate\na successful style.  However, a challenge to produce a single chapter like the\nQuran – the shortest chapter being merely three verses of modest length – has\nproven impossible to meet.\nWe should remember that not all Arabic speakers are\nMuslim.  Many are Christians and Jews.  Some are atheists.  They live all over\nthe world.  Among all of these non-Muslim Arabs, there are leading poets and\nprose writers and important literary critics.  None of them claim that they or\nanyone else has produced a literary work that resembles the Quran in both style\nand quality.\nFor an Arabic speaker, this is an obvious thing.  Any\nArab who looks at people’s attempts to write in the Quran’s style usually\nbreaks out in laughter at its awkwardness or banality.\nFor non-Arabic speakers, though they cannot experience\nthis directly, they can ascertain that no serious literary claim has been made.\nGranted, there is subjectivity in any literary\nevaluation.  This would pose a problem in a challenge with a single judge or a\npanel of judges, or if there is a biased criterion like “only Muslims scholars\ncan be judges”.\nHowever, there is no such restriction in the challenge.\nThe general consensus of the international Arabic\nliterary community – and the Arab masses – is that nothing exists to meet the\nchallenge.  This is an objective yardstick.",

    "content": "Organization of the Article\nThis article consists of a first part which is the background and context of the two stories that are told in the second and third part.  The main story is the narration of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb to\nAbdullah\nibn Abbas concerning his meeting with Heraclius in Jerusalem, recorded in the collection of\nSaheeh al-Bukhari\n.  Appended to this narration is another, whose source was the Governor of Jerusalem, ibn al-Natur.  From the events recorded in each story, it seems obvious that the invitation to Islam by Heraclius to his people in Homs happened at a later date than the meeting of Abu Sufyan with him in Jerusalem.  However, it also seems clear that Heraclius must have called for Abu Sufyan after he had heard news of the Prophet in Arabia.  Moreover, it is without doubt that when Abu Sufyan met Heraclius, the latter was in possession of the letter from the Prophet.  Thus I have split the narration of ibn al-Natur into two episodes which coincidentally occurred in two different locations.  The first episode took place in Jerusalem, before the meeting of Abu Sufyan with Heraclius there. while the second in Homs, after Heraclius left Jerusalem.  I have also placed the split narration before and after Abu Sufyan’s story.  Both stories were narrated by ibn Abbas.\nAbu Sufyan ibn Harb\nAlthough Abu Sufyan was to eventually embrace Islam, for most of his career during the life of the Prophet, he was bitterly opposed to it.  He was the leader of the Umayyad clan of the Quraish tribe and was the chieftain of the entire Quraish tribe, making him one of the most powerful men in Mecca during the lifetime of Muhammad.  His great-grand father was Abdul Shams ibn Abd al-Manaf, whose brother was Hashim, the great-grandfather of Muhammad, so there was a distant cousin relationship between them.  It was Abu Sufyan’s position that made him an enemy of Muhammad, whom he viewed as a threat to his power and a blasphemer of the Quraish gods.  The enmity between the Quraish, of whom Abu Sufyan was a prominent leader, and the early Muslims reached such heights that many battles were fought between the two parties after the Muslims settled in Medina in which he participated, and it was he who led the army of Quraish in the Battle of Uhud in 625CE.  After the Treaty of Hudaybiyya in 628CE, he took a trading caravan to Greater Syria, and was called to Caesar in Jerusalem.  Meanwhile, the treaty with Muhammad was broken by allies of the Quraish while Abu Sufyan was on the way back to Mecca.  Knowing the Muslims were now free from the treaty made a year and a half earlier, he personally went to Medina to try and patch it up, but came away empty handed.  The Muslims subsequently attacked Mecca in 630CE.  Seeing the writing on the wall, Abu Sufyan fled the city, but later returned in order to embrace Islam.\nThe Prophet and the Emperor\nThe Prophet Muhammad and the Emperor Heraclius were contemporaries.  Born only 5 years apart, they both lived into their sixties.  The reign of Heraclius was marked by ups and downs in military success.  In 609CE, when he was 40, Muhammad received the first revelations that marked the beginning of his prophetic mission.  In 610CE Heraclius deposed Procus as Emperor and took his place, but the beginning of his reign was marked by the defeat of his armies in Palestine and Turkey between 614 and 619CE.\n[1]\nThese defeats, and the subsequent victory the Romans would enjoy, were mentioned in the Quran at the time:\n“The Romans have been defeated in the nearer land; and they, after their defeat, will be victorious.  Within three to nine years.” (Quran 30:2-4)\nThe reconquest by the Romans of the lands ceded to Khosrau started in 625 and ended in triumph in 627CE.  The following year, Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, sent the following letter to Heraclius by the hand of Dihya al-Kalbi, by way of the governor of Bostra al-Sham, in Syria.\nThe Letter\nThe letter Muhammad sent is incorporated in the narration of Abu Sufyan, and I reproduce it below word for word as Heraclius read it out before all his Grandees.\nIn the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful.\nThis letter is from Muhammad the slave of God and His Messenger to Heraclius, the ruler of the Byzantines.\nPeace be upon him who follows the right path.\nI am writing this invitation to call you to Islam.\n[2]\nIf you become a Muslim you will be safe - and God will double your reward, but if you reject this invitation of Islam you will bear the sin of having misguided your subjects\n[3]\n.  Thus do I urge you to heed the following:\n“O People of the Scriptures!  Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.  Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims.”\nMuhammad, the Messenger of God\n[4]\nIn contrast to Khosrau II, who had been sent a similar letter earlier, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius kept the letter and sought to find confirmation concerning what it contained.  This is quite different to the treatment accorded to his letter to Khosrau II of the Sassinid Empire.  According to Abdullah ibn Abbas, the latter was sent with\nAbdullah ibn Hudhafa al-Sahmi\nby way of the Governor of Bahrain.\n“\nSo, when Khosrau read the letter he tore it up.  Saeed ibn al-Musaiyab said, ‘The Prophet then invoked God to destroy and disperse Khosrau and his followers fully and with severity”. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nThe Sassinid Empire was to utterly dissolve almost immediately, first through the defeat by the Romans, and then by the onslaught of the new Muslim nation.  The Byzantine Empire, too, while still under Heraclius, dissolved in Egypt, Palestine and Syria.  However, unlike the Sassinid Empire, the Byzantine Empire continued on in various forms for another 800 years until Constantinople finally fell, and this may be because of the contrast in the way each of the letters was received.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nHeraclius\n.

(Quran 12:102)\nConsider the verses:\nAnd We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had\ndestroyed the former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance\nand mercy that they might be reminded.  And you, [O Muhammad], were not on the\nwestern side [of the mount] when We revealed to Moses the command, and you were\nnot among the witnesses [to that] but We produced [many] generations [after\nMoses], and prolonged was their duration.  And you were not a resident among\nthe people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were senders [of this\nmessage].  And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but\n[were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no Warner had\ncome before you that they might be reminded.  And if not that a disaster should\nstrike them for what their hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, ‘Our\nLord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses\nand been among the believers?’ (Quran 28:43-47)\nThese events in the story of Moses were related\nby Muhammad.  Either he witnessed them and was present there, or learned it\nfrom those who knew.  In either case, he would not be God’s prophet.  The only\nother possibility, rather an inescapable conclusion, is that Muhammad was\ntaught by God Himself.\nA few facts must be considered to recognize the\nfull strength of the argument.  Muhammad did not learn from any religious\nscholar, there were no Jewish or Christian scholars in Mecca at the time, and he\ndid not know any language other than Arabic.  In addition to the previous, he\ncould neither read nor write.  No Meccan, Jew, or Christian ever claimed to be\nMuhammad’s teacher.  Had Muhammad learned from any source, his own companions\nwho believed in him would have exposed him.\nSay, ‘If God had willed, I would not have recited it\nto you, nor would He have made it known to you, for I had remained among you a\nlifetime before it.  Then will you not reason?’ (Quran 10:16)\nDespite their strong opposition, the unbelievers\ncould not attribute his knowledge of the past and present to any source.  The\nfailure of his contemporaries is sufficient proof against all later skeptics.\nThe Correction of Jewish and Christian\nMisunderstandings\nBelow are two examples of the Quran correcting\nwhat had undergone change in Jewish and Christian beliefs:\n(1)  The Jews claim Abraham to be a Jew,\nthe father of the Jewish nation, whereas the Christians consider him to be\ntheir father as well, as the Roman Catholic Church calls Abraham our father in\nFaith in the Eucharistic prayer called Roman Canon recited during Mass.  God\nresponds to them in the Quran:\nO People of the Scripture, why do you argue about\nAbraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him?  Then\nwill you not reason? (Quran 3:65)\n(2)  The Quran forcefully denies the\ncrucifixion of Jesus, an event of immense proportions to both religions:\nAnd [We cursed them] for their breaking of the\ncovenant and their disbelief in the signs of God and their killing of the\nprophets without right and their saying, ‘Our hearts are wrapped’ [i.e., sealed\nagainst reception].  Rather, God has sealed them because of their disbelief, so\nthey believe not, except for a few.  And [We cursed them] for their disbelief\nand their saying against Mary a great slander, And [for] their saying, ‘Indeed,\nwe have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of God.’  And\nthey did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to\nresemble him to them.  And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about\nit.  They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption.  And they\ndid not kill him, for certain. (Quran 4:155-157)\nThis Quranic denial raises some fundamental\nquestions.\nFirst, if Islamic doctrine were borrowed from\nJudaism and Christianity, why did it deny crucifixion?  After all, both\nreligions agree it took place!  For the Jews, it was Jesus the imposter who was\ncrucified, but for Christians, it was the Son of God.  The Prophet Muhammad\ncould have easily agreed to the crucifixion of Jesus, this giving more credit\nto his message.  If Islam were a false religion, an imitation of Judaism or\nChristianity, or if Muhammad was not true in his claim, Islam would not take an\nuncompromising stand on this issue and declare both religions to be outright\nwrong in this matter, as there is nothing as such to gain by its denial.\nSecond, if Islam had borrowed the myth of\ncrucifixion from these two religions, it would have eliminated a point of major\ncontention with them, but Islam brought the truth and could not vindicate a\nmyth just to appease them.  It is quite possible the Jews were responsible for\ncrucifying Jesus, for their historical transgressions against the prophets of\nGod has been documented in the bible and the Quran alike.  But in regards to\nJesus, the Quran states forcefully:\nAnd they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him.\nHow is it\npossible, then, to say that the Muhammad produced the Quran by information learnt\nfrom Jewish or Christian scholars when he brought ideologies uprooting their\ndoctrine?\nThird, the denial of crucifixion by itself\nnegates other Christian beliefs:\n(i)   Jesus’ atonement for sin’s of man.\n(ii)  Burden of original sin carried by all\nmen.\n(iii) Deconstructs the myth of the cross\nand its veneration.\n(iv) The last supper and the Eucharist.\nThus we see that the stories the Prophet, may\nthe mercy and blessings of God be upon him, told of nations of past were not\nmere folklore, nor were they learnt from Jewish or Christian learned men.  Rather,\nthey were revealed to him from above the seven heavens by the God of creation.",

    "content": "“Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is\nthe Messenger of God and last of the prophets. And God has knowledge of all\nthings.” (Quran 33: 40)\nWhen a person accepts Islam,\nreconfirms his or her faith or prays any of the five daily prayers, they also\naffirm their belief in Muhammad as a prophet of God; the final prophet.  In\naddition to this over 1.5 billion people the world over believe that Prophet\nMuhammad’s life is worthy of being emulated and aspired to.  However many\npeople embrace Islam without really knowing Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and\nblessings of God be upon him.  Perhaps all they know is that he was born and\nlived in the Arabian Peninsula and received the literal word of God in the form\nof the Quran.  In the following two articles we will look at the noble life of\nProphet Muhammad, learn to know and love him just a little bit more.  We will\nachieve this by looking at the signs of Prophethood in his noble life.\nIn Arabic the word prophet (nabi) is derived from the\nword naba which means news. Thus we deduce that a prophet spreads the news of\nGod and His message, they are in a sense God’s ambassadors on earth.  Their\nmission is to convey the message to worship One God.  This includes, calling\nthe people to God, explaining the message, bringing glad tidings or warnings\nand directing the affairs of the nation. All the prophets were anxious to\nconvey God’s message sincerely and completely and this included the last\nprophet, Muhammad. During his final sermon Prophet Muhammad asked the congregation\nthree times whether he had delivered the message, and called on God to witness\ntheir answer, which was a resounding “yes!”.\nAs well as the essence of their call to One God, another\naccepted sign of the truth of the prophets is how they live their lives.  The\naccounts of Prophet Muhammad’s life that we have inherited from our righteous\npredecessors illustrate that Muhammad’s Prophethood was guided by God from the\nvery beginning.  Long before, Prophethood Muhammad was being prepared to guide\nhumankind to the straight path and his life experiences stood him in good stead\nfor such a weighty mission.  Then at the age of 40 when Prophethood was\nbestowed upon him, God continued to support and affirm his mission. Any account\nof Muhammad’s life is filled with examples of his exemplary character; he was\nmerciful, compassionate, truthful, brave, and generous, while striving solely\nfor the rewards of the Hereafter.  The way Prophet Muhammad dealt with his\ncompanions, acquaintances, enemies, animals and even inanimate objects left no\ndoubt that he was ever mindful of God.\nMuhammad’s birth was accompanied by many so called\nmiraculous events and the talk of the extraordinary events no doubt functioned\nas signs of Prophethood, however we must be cautious about believing\nunreservedly in those extraordinary events. Not all of the events are accepted\nby all of the biographers and historians of Islamic history thus although they\nindicate an extraordinary beginning and a life destined to be guided by God,\nthey may be embellished or exaggerated.\nSpecial but not unique circumstances surrounded\nchildhood of Prophet Muhammad and these undoubtedly had a bearing on his\ncharacter. By the time he was eight years old he had suffered through the death\nof both his parents and his beloved grandfather Abdul Muttalib.  He was left in\nthe care of his uncle and great supporter Abu Talib.  Thus even as a young boy\nhe had already suffered great emotional and physical upheaval.  Both the many\nchroniclers of Muhammad’s life and the Quran acknowledge his disrupted life.\nDid He not find you (O Muhammad) an orphan and gave you a refuge?\n(Quran 93:6)\nMuhammad’s uncle Abu Talib\nwas\npoor and struggled to keep his family fed, thus during his adolescence Muhammad\nworked as a shepherd.\nFrom this occupation\nhe learned to embrace solitude and developed characteristics such\nas patience, cautiousness, care, leadership and an ability to sense danger. \nShepherding was an occupation that all the prophets of God we know of had in\ncommon. ‘…The companions asked, “Were you a shepherd?”  He replied, “There was\nno prophet who was not a shepherd.”’\n[1]\nIn his teens Muhammad sometimes travelled with Abu\nTalib, accompanying caravans to trade centres. On at least one occasion, he is\nsaid to have travelled as far north as Syria.  Older merchants recognized his\ncharacter and nicknamed him Al-Amin, the one you can trust.  Even in his youth\nhe was known as truthful and trustworthy.  One story that is accepted by most\nIslamic scholars and historians is the account of one of Prophet Muhammad’s\ntrips to Syria.\nThe story goes that the monk Bahira foretold the coming\nProphethood and counselled Abu Talib to “guard his nephew carefully”. \nAccording to biographer Ibn Ishaq, as the caravan in which Prophet Muhammad was\ntravelling approached the edge of town, Bahira could see a cloud that appeared\nto be shading and following a young man.  When the caravan halted under the\nshadow of some trees, Bahira “looked at the cloud when it over-shadowed the\ntree, and its branches were bending and drooping over the apostle of God until\nhe was in the shadow beneath it.” After Bahira witnessed this he observed\nMuhammad closely and asked him many questions concerning a number of Christian\nprophecies he had read and heard about.\nThe young Muhammad was distinguished among his people\nfor his modesty, virtuous behaviour and graceful manners, thus it was no\nsurprise for his companions to see him, even as a youth many years before\nProphethood, shun superstitious practices and keep away from drinking alcohol,\neating meat slaughtered on stone altars or attending idolatrous festivals.  By\nthe time he reached adulthood Muhammad was thought of as the most reliable and\ntrustworthy member of the Meccan community.  Even those who concerned\nthemselves with petty tribal squabbles acknowledged Muhammad’s honesty and\nintegrity.\nMuhammad’s virtues and good moral character was\nestablished from a young age, and God continued to support and guide him.  When\nhe was 40 years old Muhammad was given the means to change the world, the means\nto benefit the whole of humanity.\nIn the following article we will look at how Muhammad’s\nlife changed after Prophethood and conclude that it is unreasonable to give\ncredence to those who claim that Muhammad was a false Prophet.  He did not claim\nProphethood to attain comfort, wealth, greatness, glory or power.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari",

    "content": "Prologue\nThe journey of the Prophet and Messenger, Muhammad, may\nthe mercy and blessings of God be upon him, by night from the Holy Mosque in Mecca to the farthest mosque in Jerusalem was a miracle granted to Him by God.  It is the\nfirst part of a night of wonder and amazement, culminating in Prophet\nMuhammad’s ascension through the heavens and into the presence of God.\n“Glorified be He Who took His slave on a journey by night from\nAl-Masjid-al-Haram\n[1]\nto the\nMasjid-al-Aqsa\n[2]\n,\nthe neighborhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him of\nOur signs\n[3]\n. \nVerily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.” (Quran 17:1)\nIt was a physical journey  and all the events about to be\ndescribed took place in one night.\nThis series of articles will use the word\nmasjid\ninstead of its English translation, mosque.  The reason for this is that the word\nmasjid implies much more than the recognisable building where Muslims pray. \nThe word masjid comes from the root “\nsa-ja-da\n” meaning to\nprostrate,\ntherefore a masjid is any place of prostration.  The Prophet Muhammad told\nus “this earth was made a Masjid for me.”\n[4]\nThis gift from God was given only to the nation of Muhammad.\nA Muslim can pray in any place that is not impure (with\na few exceptions).  There are buildings specifically for prayer, but any place\na Muslim prays is a masjid, in the literal sense – a place of prostration.  The\nact of prostration is the most honourable part of the prayer.  When a Muslim’s forehead\ntouches the ground, he or she is very close to God.  Prayer establishes the\nconnection between the believer and his Lord, and it was on\nthis\nmiraculous night that the five daily prayers were instated.\nIn the story to follow you will learn some more about\nthis man called Muhammad and come to understand a little about why Muslims love\nhim.  You will also discover why\nMasjid al-Aqsa\nin Jerusalem is one of\nthe three Holy Masjids in Islam.  God refers to Jerusalem in the Quran as\n“the\nneighbourhood we have blessed”\n.  The Dome of the Rock, part of the precinct\nof Masjid al-Aqsa, is the most recognizable symbol of Jerusalem and holds a\nspecial place in the hearts of every Muslim.  On this journey we are about to\nundertake you will learn why.  So let us travel back through time, to 7\nth\ncentury Arabia, to the city of Mecca and accompany Prophet Muhammad on his\nnight journey and ascension.\nThe Journey Commences\nApproximately ten years after Prophet Muhammad received\nthe first revelations of the Quran, he suffered two grave losses.  One was the\ndeath of his uncle Abu Talib, the man who had supported and loved him from the\ntime he was a young orphan, and then only two months later, Muhammad’s beloved\nwife, Khadijah, died.  This year became known as the Year of Sorrow.\nIn the years leading up to these sad events, the new\nMuslims, especially Prophet Muhammad, were persecuted, ridiculed and abused.  The\nstrength and loyalty of his uncle combined with the love and compassion shown\nto him by Khadijah helped him to remain strong and continue spreading the\nmessage in the face of grave adversity.  However, he now felt alone and\nextremely overwhelmed by his sadness.\nWhen one has truly surrendered to God, the pains and\nsorrows of this life form part of a test of faith, and these tests are always\nfollowed by relief.  In chapter 94 of the Quran, called\nSolace\n, God\nassures Prophet Muhammad that with every hardship comes relief, and He repeats it\na second time with emphasis - with every hardship comes relief.  After this\nextremely difficult year, Prophet Muhammad felt his relief in the form of a\nmajor blessing, the Night Journey and Ascension.\n“So verily, with hardship, there is relief. Verily, with hardship,\nthere is relief.” (Quran 94:5-6)\nEven though it was dangerous and he risked attack by the\nPagans of Mecca, Prophet Muhammad often spent the night in prayer at the Holy\nMasjid in Mecca.  On this particular night, he was lying close to the\nKa’ba\n(the black cube in the middle of the Masjid) in a state between wakefulness and\nsleep.  An angel came and cut open his chest from the throat to the below the\nstomach.  The angel removed Prophet Muhammad’s heart and placed it in a golden\nbowl filled with faith, the heart was purified, filled and returned to its\nplace.\n[5]\nThis was not the first time that an angel had come down\nand extracted Muhammad’s heart.  As a small child, Muhammad lived in the\ndeserts of Arabia with a foster family according to custom, for the desert\nenvironment was known to be much healthier and more suitable for proper\ncultivation than the cities.  When he was four or five years old and playing in\nthis wilderness with his young friends, the Angel Gabriel appeared, removed\nMuhammad’s heart and extracted from it a portion, referring to it as “a part of\nSatan”.  The Angel Gabriel washed the heart with the water of\nzamzam\n(the\nwell of Mecca which sprung to quench the thirst of Ishmael) and returned it to\nits place.  The other children ran away screaming, thinking Muhammad was being\nmurdered, but by the time they returned with help, he was alone, scared and\nwhite, but with only a small mark from the ordeal.\n[6]\nProphet Muhammad’s mission was to guide all of humanity\nto the worship of the One True God, thus every aspect of his life formed part\nof God’s plan to prepare him for this great responsibility.  As a child, the\npart of\nSatan\nwas removed from his heart, and as an adult, about to\nundertake the building of the Muslim nation, his heart was purified and filled\nwith pure faith.  The next part of this miraculous night then commenced.\nProphet Muhammad was presented with a white animal he\ndescribed as being smaller than a horse but larger than a donkey, it was known\nas\nal-Buraq\n.  This animal, he said, could take a stride as far as it\ncould see.  With one leap, al Buraq could cover an incredibly vast distance.\n[7]\nThe Angel Gabriel\ntold Prophet Muhammad to mount the animal, and together they travelled more\nthan 1200 km. to the furthest masjid – Masjid al-Aqsa.\nProphet Muhammad was on the back of al-Buraq while the animal’s\nstride reached towards the horizon, and the stars glittered in the night sky\nover the deserts of Arabia and beyond.  He must have felt the wind on his face\nand been aware of his newly filled heart thumping in his chest.  Imagine what\nsigns and wonders of God Prophet Muhammad must have seen on that miraculous\njourney by night!\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe holy mosque in the sanctuary of Mecca\n[2]\nThe furthest mosque in Jerusalem\n[3]\nAyaat\n, the word in Arabic, has multiple connotations: proofs, evidences,\nverses & lessons.\n[4]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[5]\nIbid.\n[6]\nSaheeh Muslim\n[7]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari",

    "featureImage": "https://de44dj20p4alh.cloudfront.net/articles/What_is_the_Sunnah_(part_1_of_2)_001.jpg",
    "content": "The Sunnah, according to the scholars of hadeeth, is\neverything that has been related from the Messenger, may the mercy and\nblessings of God be upon him, of his statements, actions, tacit approvals,\npersonality, physical description, or biography.  It does not matter whether\nthe information being related refers to something before the beginning of his prophetic\nmission, or after it.\nExplanation of this definition:\nThe statements of the Prophet include everything the\nProphet said for various reasons on different occasions.  For example, he said:\n“Verily deeds are but by intentions, and every\nperson will have only what he intended.”\nThe actions of the Prophet include everything that the\nProphet did that was related to us by his Companions.  This includes how he\nmade ablutions, how he performed his prayers, and how he made the Hajj\npilgrimage.\nThe tacit approvals of the Prophet includes everything\nthat his Companions said or did that he either showed his favor towards or at\nleast did not object to.  Anything that had the tacit approval of the Prophet\nis as valid as anything that he said or did himself.\nAn example of this is the approval that was given to the\nCompanions when they used their discretion in deciding when to pray during the\nBattle of Bani Quraydhah.  God’s Messenger had said to them:\n“None of you should perform your afternoon prayers\nuntil you arrive at Bani Quraydhah.”\nThe Companions did not arrive at Bani Quraydhah until\nafter sunset.  Some of them took the Prophet’s words literally and postponed\nthe afternoon prayer, saying: “We will not pray until we get there.”  Others\nunderstood that the Prophet was only indicating to them that they should hurry\non their journey, so they stopped and prayed the afternoon prayer on time.\nThe Prophet learned about what the two groups had\ndecided, but did not criticize either of them.\nAs for the Prophet’s personality, this would include the\nfollowing statement of Aishah (may God be pleased with her):\n“God’s Messenger was never indecent or vulgar, nor\nwas he loud at the marketplace.  He would never respond to the abuse of others\nwith abuses of his own.  Instead, he would be tolerant and forgiving.”\nThe physical description of the Prophet is found in\nstatements like the one related by Anas (may God be pleased with him):\n“God’s Messenger was neither overly tall nor was he\nshort.  He was neither exceedingly white nor black.  His hair was neither\nexcessively curly nor lank.”\nThe Relationship between the Sunnah and Revelation\nThe Sunnah is revelation from God to His Prophet.  God\nsays in the Quran:\n“…We have sent down to him the Book and the Wisdom…” (Quran\n2:231)\nThe Wisdom refers to the Sunnah.  The great jurist al-Shafi’i\nsaid: “God mentions the Book, which is the Quran.  I have heard from people who\nI consider authorities on the Quran that the Wisdom is the Sunnah of God’s\nMessenger.”  God says:\nIndeed, God conferred a great favor on the believers\nwhen He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His\nsigns and purifying them and instructing them in the Book and the Wisdom.\nIt is clear from the preceding verses that God revealed\nto His Prophet both the Quran and the Sunnah, and that He commanded him to\nconvey both to the people.  The Prophetic hadeeth also attest to the fact that\nthe Sunnah is revelation.  It is related from Mak’hool that God’s Messenger said:\n“God gave me the Quran and what is like it from the\nWisdom.”\nAl-Miqdam b. Ma’dee Karab relates that God’s Messenger said:\n“I have been given the Book and with it something\nlike it.”\nHisan b. Atiyyah relates that Gabriel used to come the\nProphet with the Sunnah just like he would come to him with the Quran.\nAn opinion from the Prophet was not merely his own\nthoughts or deliberations on a matter; it was what God revealed to him.  In\nthis way, the Prophet was different from other people.  He was supported by\nrevelation.  When he exercised his own reasoning and was correct, God would confirm\nit, and if he ever made a mistake in his thinking, God would correct it and\nguide him to the truth.\nFor this reason, it is related that the Caliph Umar said\nfrom the pulpit: “O people!  The opinions of God’s Messenger were correct only\nbecause God would reveal them to him.  As for our opinions, they are nothing\nbut thoughts and conjecture.”\nThe revelation that the Prophet received was of two\ntypes:\nA.    Informative revelation:\nGod would\ninform him of something by means of revelation in one form or another as\nmentioned in the following Quranic verse:\n“It is not for a human being that God should speak to him\nexcept as revelation or from behind a barrier, or by sending a Messenger who\nreveals by His leave whatever He wishes.  Verily, He is Exalted, All-Wise.”\n(Quran 42:51)\nAishah related that al-Harith b. Hisham asked the\nProphet how revelation came to him, and the Prophet answered:\n“Sometimes, the angel comes to me like the clanging\nof a bell, and this is the most difficult for me. It weighs upon me and I commit\nto memory what he says.  And sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a\nman and speaks to me and I commit to memory what he says.”\nAishah said:\n“I had seen him when the revelation came to him on\nan extremely cold day.  When it was over, his brow was full of perspiration.”\nSometimes, he would be asked about something, but he\nwould remain silent until revelation came to him.  For example, the Meccan\npagans asked him about the soul, but the Prophet remained silent until God\nrevealed:\nThey ask you concerning the soul.  Say: ‘The soul is from the\naffairs of my Lord, and of knowledge you have but little’. (Quran 17:85)\nHe had also been asked about how inheritance was to be\ndivided, but he did not answer until God revealed:\n“God commands you regarding your children…” (Quran 4:11)\nB.    Affirmative revelation:\nThis is where\nthe Prophet exercised his own judgment in a matter.  If his opinion was\ncorrect, revelation would come to him affirming it, and if it was incorrect,\nrevelation would come to correct him, making it just like any other informative\nrevelation.  The only difference here is that the revelation came as a result\nof an action that the Prophet first did on his own.\nIn such instances, the Prophet was left to use his own\ndiscretion in a matter.  If he chose what was right, then God would confirm his\nchoice through revelation.  If he chose wrong, God would correct him to protect\nthe integrity of the faith.  God would never allow His Messenger to convey an\nerror to other people, because this would cause his followers to fall into\nerror as well.  This would contravene the wisdom behind sending Messengers,\nwhich was that the people henceforth would have no argument against God.  In\nthis way, the Messenger was protected from falling into error, for if he ever\nerred, revelation would come to correct him.\nThe Prophet’s Companions knew that the tacit approval of\nthe Prophet was actually the approval of God, because if they ever did\nsomething contrary to Islam during the Prophet’s lifetime, revelation would\ncome down condemning what they did.\nJabir said: “We used to practice coitus interruptus\n[1]\nback when God’s Messenger was alive.”  Sufyan, one of the narrators of this\nhadeeth, commented: “If something like this was forbidden, the Quran would have\nprohibited it.”\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nCoitus\nInterruptus: Withdrawal of the penis before emission of sperm during sex.\n–\nIslamReligion.com",

    "featureImage": "",
    "content": "The Difference between the Sunnah and the Quran\nThe Quran is the foundation of Islamic Law.  It is the\nmiraculous speech of God that was revealed to the Messenger, may the mercy and\nblessings of God be upon him, by way of the angel Gabriel.  It has been\ntransmitted to us with so many chains of authority that its historical\nauthenticity is unquestionable.  It is written down in its own volume, and its\nrecitation is a form of worship.\nAs for the Sunnah, it is everything besides the Quran\nthat came from God’s Messenger.  It explains and provides details for the laws\nfound in the Quran.  It also provides examples of the practical application of\nthese laws.  It is also either direct revelation from God, or decisions of the\nMessenger that were then confirmed by revelation.  Therefore, the source of all\nthe Sunnah is revelation.\nThe Quran is the revelation that is formally recited as\nan act of worship, and the Sunnah is revelation that is not formally recited.  The\nSunnah, though, is just like the Quran in that it is revelation that must be\nfollowed and adhered to.\nThe Quran takes precedence over the Sunnah in two ways. \nFor one thing, the Quran consists of the exact words of God, miraculous in\nnature, down to the last verse.  The Sunnah, however, is not necessarily the\nexact words of God, but rather their meanings as explained by the Prophet.\nThe Position of the Sunnah in Islamic Law\nDuring the Messenger’s lifetime the Quran and Sunnah\nwere the only sources of Islamic Law.\nThe Quran provides the general injunctions that formed\nthe basis of the Law, without going into all the details and secondary\nlegislation, with the exception of a few injunctions that are established along\nwith the general principles.  These injunctions are not subject to change over\ntime or with the changing circumstances of the people.  The Quran, likewise,\ncomes with the tenets of belief, sets down acts of worship, mentions the\nstories of the nations of old, and provides moral guidelines.\nThe Sunnah comes in agreement with the Quran.  It\nexplains the meanings of what is unclear in the text, provides details for what\nis depicted in general terms, specifies what is general, and explains its\ninjunctions and objectives.  The Sunnah also comes with injunctions that are\nnot provided by the Quran, but these are always in harmony with its principles,\nand they always advance the objectives that are outlined in the Quran.\nThe Sunnah is a practical expression of what is in the Quran. \nThis expression takes many forms.  Sometimes, it comes as an action performed\nby the Messenger.  At other times, it is a statement that he made in response\nto something.  Sometimes, it takes the form of a statement or action of one of\nthe Companions that he neither prevented nor objected to.  On the contrary, he\nremained silent about it or expressed his approval for it.\nThe Sunnah explains and clarifies the Quran in many ways. \nIt explains how to perform the acts of worship and carry out the laws that are\nmentioned in the Quran.  God commands the believers to pray without mentioning\nthe times that the prayers had to be performed or the manner of performing them. \nThe Messenger clarified this through his own prayers and by teaching the\nMuslims how to pray.  He said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”\nGod makes the Hajj pilgrimage obligatory without\nexplaining its rites.  God’s Messenger explains this by saying:\n“Take the rites of Hajj from me.”\nGod makes the Zakah tax obligatory without mentioning\nwhat types of wealth and produce it is to be levied against.  God also does not\nmention the minimum amount of wealth that makes the tax obligatory.  The\nSunnah, though, makes all this clear.\nThe Sunnah specifies general statements found in the Quran. \nGod says:\n“God commands you regarding your children: to the male, a\nportion equal to that of two females…” (Quran 4:11)\nThis wording is general, applying to every family and\nmaking every child an inheritor of his or her parents.  The Sunnah makes this\nruling more specific by excluding the children of Prophets.  God’s Messenger\nsaid:\n“We Prophets leave behind no inheritance.  Whatever\nwe leave behind is charity.”\nThe Sunnah qualifies unqualified statements in the Quran. \nGod says:\n“…and you find no water, then perform\ntayammum\n(dry\nablution) with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands… (Quran 5:6)\nThe verse does not mention the extent of the hand,\nleaving the question of whether one should rub the hands up to the wrist or the\nforearm.  The Sunnah makes this clear by showing that it is to the wrist,\nbecause this is what God’s Messenger did when he performed dry ablution.\nThe Sunnah also comes emphasizing what is in the Quran\nor providing secondary legislation for a law stated therein.  This includes all\nthe hadeeth that indicate that Prayer, the Zakah tax, fasting, and the Hajj\npilgrimage are obligatory.\nAn example of where the Sunnah provides subsidiary\nlegislation for an injunction found in the Quran is the ruling found in the\nSunnah that it is forbidden to sell fruit before it begins to ripen.  The basis\nfor this law is the statement of the Quran:\nDo not consume your property amongst you unjustly, except it\nbe a trade among you by mutual consent.\nThe Sunnah contains rulings that are not mentioned in\nthe Quran and that do not come as clarifications for something mentioned in the\nQuran.  An example of this is the prohibition of eating donkey flesh and the\nflesh of predatory beasts.  Another example of this is the prohibition of\nmarrying a woman and her aunt at the same time.  These and other rulings\nprovided by the Sunnah must be adhered to.\nThe Obligation of Adhering to the Sunnah\nA requirement of believing in prophethood is to accept\nas true everything that God’s Messenger said.  God chose His Messengers from\namong His worshippers to convey His Law to humanity.  God says:\n“…God knows best with whom to place His Message…” (Quran\n6:124)\nGod also says:\n“…Are the Messengers charged with anything but to convey the\nclear Message?” (Quran 16:35)\nThe Messenger is protected from error in all of his\nactions.  God has protected his tongue from uttering anything but the truth.  God\nhas protected his limbs from doing anything but what is right.\nGod has safeguarded him from showing approval for\nanything contrary to Islamic Law.  He is the most beautifully complete of God’s\nCreations.  This is clear from how God describes him in the Quran:\n“By the star when it sets.  Your companion has neither gone\nastray nor has he erred.  Nor does he speak of his own desire.  It is only\nrevelation that has been revealed.” (Quran 53:1-4)\nWe see in the hadeeth that no circumstances, no matter\nhow trying, could prevent the Prophet from speaking the truth.  Being angry\nnever affected his speech.  He never spoke falsehood even when he was jesting. \nHis own interests never swayed him from speaking the truth.  The only goal that\nhe sought was the pleasure of God Almighty.\nAbdullah b. Amr b. al-Aas related that he used to write\ndown everything that God’s Messenger said.  Then the tribe of Quraish forbade\nhim from doing so, saying: “Do you write down everything that God’s Messenger\nsays, and he is but a man who speaks in contentment and in anger?”\nAbdullah b. Amr stopped writing and mentioned this to\nGod’s Messenger who told him:\n“Write, for by Him in Whose hand is my soul, only\ntruth comes forth from this.” …and pointed to his mouth.\nThe Quran, the Sunnah, and the consensus of the jurists\nall point to the fact that obeying God’s Messenger is obligatory.  God says in\nthe Quran:\n“O you who believe, obey God and obey His Messenger and those\nin authority among you.  If you fall into dispute about a matter, refer it back\nto God and His Messenger if you believe in God and the Last Day…” (Quran 4:59)",

(\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari, ‘Book of Oppression.’\n)\nHadith 2\nSalim narrated on the authority of his father that the\nProphet said:\nWhoever takes a piece of land of others unjustly,\nhe will sink down the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari,\n‘Book of Oppression.’\n)\nThe aforementioned hadith prohibits oppression in\ngeneral, especially the taking of a piece of land belonging to others unjustly.  What might the seven earths refer to?\nStudies in geology have proven that the earth is\ncomposed of seven zones, identified from the inner to the outer layers as\nfollows:\n(1)  The Solid Inner Core of Earth: 1.7% of the\nEarth’s mass; depth of 5,150 - 6,370 kilometers (3,219 - 3,981 miles)\nThe inner core is solid and unattached to the mantle,\nsuspended in the molten outer core.  It is believed to have solidified as a\nresult of pressure-freezing which occurs to most liquids when temperature\ndecreases or pressure increases.\n(2)  The Liquid Outer core: 30.8% of Earth’s mass;\ndepth of 2,890 - 5,150 kilometers (1,806 - 3,219 miles)\nThe outer core is a hot, electrically conducting liquid\nwithin which convective motion occurs.  This conductive layer combines with\nEarth’s rotation to create a dynamo effect that maintains a system of\nelectrical currents known as the Earth’s magnetic field.  It is also\nresponsible for the subtle jerking of Earth’s rotation.  This layer is not as\ndense as pure molten iron, which indicates the presence of lighter elements.  Scientists\nsuspect that about 10% of the layer is composed of sulfur and/or oxygen because\nthese elements are abundant in the cosmos and dissolve readily in molten iron.\n(3)  The D Layer: 3% of Earth’s mass; depth of\n2,700 - 2,890 kilometers (1,688 - 1,806 miles)\nThis layer is 200 to 300 kilometers (125 to 188 miles)\nthick and represents about 4% of the mantle-crust mass.  Although it is often\nidentified as part of the lower mantle, seismic discontinuities suggest the D\nlayer might differ chemically from the lower mantle lying above it.  Scientists\ntheorize that the material either dissolved in the core, or was able to sink\nthrough the mantle but not into the core because of its density.\n(4)  Lower Mantle: 49.2% of Earth’s mass; depth of\n650 - 2,890 kilometers (406 -1,806 miles)\nThe lower mantle contains 72.9% of the mantle-crust mass\nand is probably composed mainly of silicon, magnesium, and oxygen.  It probably\nalso contains some iron, calcium, and aluminum.  Scientists make these\ndeductions by assuming the Earth has a similar abundance and proportion of\ncosmic elements as found in the Sun and primitive meteorites.\n(5)  Middle Mantle (Transition region): 7.5% of\nEarth’s mass; depth of 400 - 650 kilometers (250-406 miles)\nThe transition region or mesosphere (for middle mantle),\nsometimes called the fertile layer, contains 11.1% of the mantle-crust mass and\nis the source of basaltic magmas.  It also contains calcium, aluminum, and\ngarnet, which is a complex aluminum-bearing silicate mineral.  This layer is\ndense when cold because of the garnet.  It is buoyant when hot because these\nminerals melt easily to form basalt which can then rise through the upper\nlayers as magma.\n(6)  Upper Mantle: 10.3% of Earth’s mass; depth of\n10 - 400 kilometers (6 - 250 miles)\nThe upper mantle contains 15.3% of the mantle-crust mass. \nFragments have been excavated for our observation by eroded mountain belts and\nvolcanic eruptions.  Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 and pyroxene (Mg,Fe)SiO3 have been\nthe primary minerals found in this way.  These and other minerals are\nrefractory and crystalline at high temperatures; therefore, most settle out of\nrising magma, either forming new material or never leaving the mantle.  Part of\nthe upper mantle called the asthenosphere might be partially molten.\n(7)  Lithosphere\nOceanic crust: 0.099% of Earth’s mass; depth of 0-10\nkilometers (0 - 6 miles)\nThe rigid, outermost layer of the Earth comprising the\ncrust and upper mantle is called the lithosphere.  The oceanic crust contains\n0.147% of the mantle-crust mass.  The majority of the Earth’s crust was made\nthrough volcanic activity.  The oceanic ridge system, a 40,000-kilometer\n(25,000 mile) network of volcanoes, generates new oceanic crust at the rate of\n17 km3 per year, covering the ocean floor with basalt.  Hawaii and Iceland are two examples of the accumulation of basalt piles.\nThis image shows a cross section through the earth’s crust\nand upper mantle showing lithosphere plates (made of the crust layer and the\ntop part of the mantle) moving over the asthenosphere (upper mantle).\nWindows\nto the Universe\n, at (http://www.windows.ucar.edu) at the University\nCorporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).  ©1995-1999, 2000 The Regents of\nthe University of Michigan; ©2000-05 University Corporation for Atmospheric\nResearch.  Continental crust:\n0.374% of Earth’s mass; depth of 0-50 kilometers (0 - 31 miles)\nThe continental crust contains 0.554% of the\nmantle-crust mass.  This is the outer part of the Earth composed essentially of\ncrystalline rocks.  These are low-density buoyant minerals dominated mostly by\nquartz (SiO2) and feldspars (metal-poor silicates).  The crust (both oceanic\nand continental) is the surface of the Earth; as such, it is the coldest part\nof our planet.  Because cold rocks deform slowly, we refer to this rigid outer\nshell as the lithosphere (the rocky or strong layer).\nThis image shows the divisions of the Earth’s interior into\n7 layers.  (Adapted from Beatty, 1990).\nConclusion\nThe layers of the earth coincide with the above mentioned\nhadith of the Prophet.  The miracle is in two matters:\n(1)  The expression of the hadith,\n‘He will sink\ndown the seven earths on the Day of Resurrection,’\nindicates the\nstratification of these earths around one center.\n(2)  The accuracy with which the Prophet of Islam\nreferred to the seven inner layers of earth.\nThe only way for a desert dweller to have known these\nfacts 1400 years ago is through revelation from God.\nReferences\nBeatty, J.

    "content": "Preliminary Issues\nThe Bible is the sacred scripture of Judaism and\nChristianity.  The Christian Bible consists of the Old Testament and the New\nTestament, with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox versions of the Old\nTestament being slightly larger because of their acceptance of certain books not\naccepted as scripture by Protestants.  The Jewish Bible includes only the books\nknown to Christians as the Old Testament.  Furthermore, the arrangements of the\nJewish and Christian canons differ considerably.\n[1]\nProphet Muhammad has been prophesized in both the Old Testament and the New\nTestament.\nJesus and the Apostles are believed to have\nspoken Aramaic.  Aramaic continued in wide use until about AD 650, when it was\nsupplanted by Arabic.\n[2]\nThe\npresent day Bible is not, however, based on the Aramaic manuscripts, but on\nGreek and Latin versions.\nQuoting the Bible prophecies does not entail\nthat Muslims accept the present day Bible in its entirety as God’s revelation. \nFor the Islamic belief on previous scriptures, please click\nhere\n.\nIt is not a pre-condition of acceptance that a\nprophet be foretold by an earlier prophet.  Moses was a prophet to Pharaoh even\nthough he was not prophesized by anyone before him.  Abraham was God’s prophet\nto Nimrod, yet no one prophesized his coming.  Noah, Lot, and others were true\nprophets of God, yet they were not foretold.  The evidence of a prophet’s truth\nis not limited to old prophecies, but it includes the actual message brought by\nhim, miracles and more.\nDiscussing prophecies is a delicate matter.  It\nrequires sifting through Bible versions and translations, recently discovered\nmanuscripts and searching out Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic words and\ninvestigating them.  The task becomes especially difficult when: prior to the\nprinting press (15th century), all copies of Bibles show textual variations.\n[3]\nThis is not an easy subject for lay people.  For this reason, the best\ntestimony comes from ancient and modern experts in the area who acknowledged\nthe prophecies.\nWe have records of early Jews and Christians, both\nmonks and rabbis, who witnessed that Muhammad was the fulfillment of specific Bible\nprophecies.  The following are some examples of these people.\nThe Awaited Prophet\nPre-Islam Jews and Christians of Arabia were\nawaiting a prophet.  Before the appearance of Muhammad, Arabia was home to\nJews, Christians, and pagan Arabs who, on occasion, went to war with each\nother.  The Jews and Christians would say: The time has come for the\nunlettered prophet to appear who will revive the religion of Abraham.  We will\njoin his ranks and wage fierce war against you.  When Muhammad actually\nappeared, some of them believed in him, and some refused.  This is why God\nrevealed:\nAnd when there came to them a Book [Quran] from God\nconfirming that which was with them – although before they used to pray for\nvictory against those who disbelieved – but [then] when there came to them that\nwhich they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of God will be upon\nthe disbelievers. (Quran 2:89)\nThe first witness was Buhaira, the Christian\nmonk, who recognized Muhammad’s prophethood when he was still young and told\nhis uncle:\n…a great fortune lies before your nephew,\nso take him home quickly.\n[4]\nThe second witness was Waraqah ibn Nawfal, a\nChristian scholar who died soon after a solitary meeting with Muhammad. \nWaraqah attested Muhammad was the Prophet of his time and received revelation\nexactly like Moses and Jesus.\n[5]\nThe Jews of Medina were anxiously awaiting the\narrival of a prophet.  The third and fourth witnesses were their two famous\nJewish rabbis, Abdullah ibn Salam and Mukhayriq.\n[6]\nThe sixth and seventh witnesses were also Yemeni\nJewish rabbis, Wahb ibn Munabbih, and Ka’b al-Ahbar (d. 656 CE).  Ka’b found\nlong passages of praise and the description of the Prophet prophesized\nby\nMosesin the Bible.\n[7]\nThe Quran states:\nIs it not a sign to them that the learned men of the\nChildren of Israel knew it (as true)?

(Quran 53:3-4)\nThis is quite\nsimilar to the verse in Deuteronomy 18:18:\nI will raise\nthem up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee,\nand will put my\nwords in his mouth\n; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command\nhim (Deuteronomy 18:18)\nThe Prophet\nMuhammad came with a message to the whole world, and from them, the Jews.  All,\nincluding the Jews, must accept his prophethood, and this is supported by the\nfollowing words:\nThe LORD thy\nGod will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,\nlike unto me; unto him ye shall hearken. (Deuteronomy 18:15)\n4.       A Warning to Rejecters\nThe prophecy continues:\nDeuteronomy 18:19  And it shall come to\npass, [that] whosoever will not hearken unto my\nwords\nwhich he shall speak in my name, I will require [it] of him. (in some\ntranslations: I will be the Revenger).\nInterestingly, Muslims begin every chapter of\nthe Quran in the name of God by saying:\nBismillah ir-Rahman ir-Raheem\n‘In the Name of God,\nthe Most-Merciful, the Dispenser of Grace.\nThe following is the\naccount of some scholars who believed this prophecy to fit Muhammad.\nThe First Witness\nAbdul-Ahad Dawud, the former Rev.  David Benjamin\nKeldani, BD, a Roman Catholic priest of the Uniate-Chaldean sect (read his\nbiography\nhere\n). \nAfter accepting Islam, he wrote the book, ‘Muhammad in the Bible.’  He writes\nabout this prophecy:\nIf these words do not apply to Muhammad, they\nstill remain unfulfilled.  Jesus himself never claimed to be the prophet\nalluded to.  Even his disciples were of the same opinion: they looked to the\nsecond coming of Jesus for the fulfillment of the prophecy (Acts 3: 17-24).  So\nfar it is undisputed that the first coming of Jesus was not the advent of the\nProphet like unto thee and his second advent can hardly fulfill the words. \nJesus, as is believed by his Church, will appear as a Judge and not as a\nlaw-giver; but the promised one has to come with a fiery law in his right\nhand.\n[4]\nThe Second Witness\nMuhammad Asad was born Leopold Weiss in July\n1900 in the city of Lvov (German Lemberg), now in Poland, then part of the\nAustrian Empire.  He was the descendant of a long line of rabbis, a line broken\nby his father, who became a barrister.  Asad himself received a thorough\nreligious education that would qualify him to keep alive the family’s\nrabbinical tradition.  He had become proficient in Hebrew at an early age and\nwas also familiar with Aramaic.  He had studied the Old Testament in the\noriginal as well as the text and commentaries of the Talmud, the Mishna and\nGemara, and he had delved into the intricacies of Biblical exegesis, the\nTargum.\n[5]\nCommenting on the verse of the Quran:\nand do not overlay the truth with falsehood, and do\nnot knowingly suppress the truth (Quran 2:42)\nMuhammad Asad writes:\nBy ‘\noverlaying the truth with falsehood’\nis meant the corrupting of the biblical text, of which the Quran frequently\naccuses the Jews (and which has since been established by objective textual\ncriticism), while the ‘\nsuppression of the truth’\nrefers to their\ndisregard or deliberately false interpretation of the words of Moses in the\nbiblical passage, ‘The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the\nmidst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken’ (Deuteronomy\n18:15), and the words attributed to God himself, ‘I will raise them up a\nprophet from among thy brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his\nmouth’ (Deuteronomy 18:18).  The ‘brethren’ of the children of Israel are\nobviously the Arabs, and particularly the musta’ribah (‘Arabianized’) group\namong them, which traces its descent to Ishmael and Abraham: and since it is\nthis group that the Arabian Prophet’s own tribe, the Quraish, belonged, the\nabove biblical passages must be taken as referring to his advent.\n[6]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nHe\n(Jesus) came unto his own, but his own received him not (John 1:11)\n[2]\nJohn\n18:36.\n[3]\n‘Muhammad:\nHis Life Based on the Earliest Sources’ by Martin Lings, p. 1-7.\n[4]\nIbid, p. 156\n[5]\n‘Berlin to Makkah: Muhammad Asad’s Journey into Islam’\nby Ismail Ibrahim Nawwab in the January/February 2002 issue of Saudi Aramco\nMagazine.\n[6]\nMuhammad Asad, ‘The Message of The Quran’ (Gibraltar:\nDar al-Andalus, 1984), p. 10-11.",

    "content": "John 14:16  And I will pray the Father,\nand he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.\n(\nAmerican Standard Version\n)\nIn this verse, Jesus promises that another Comforter\nwill appear, and thus, we must discuss some issues concerning this Comforter.\nThe Greek word paravklhtoß,\nho parakletos\n,\nhas been translated as ‘Comforter.’\nParakletos\nmore precisely means ‘one\nwho pleads another’s cause, an intercessor.’\n[1]\nThe\nho parakletos\nis a person in the Greek language, not an incorporeal\nentity.  In the Greek language, every noun possesses gender; that is, it is\nmasculine, feminine or neutral.  In the Gospel of John, Chapters 14, 15 and 16\nthe\nho parakletos\nis actually a person.  All pronouns in Greek must\nagree in gender with the word to which they refer and the pronoun he is used\nwhen referring to the\nparakletos\n.  The NT uses the word\npneuma\n,\nwhich means breath or spirit, the Greek equivalent of\nruah\n, the\nHebrew word for spirit used in the OT.\nPneuma\nis a grammatically neutral\nword and is always represented by the pronoun it.\nAll present day Bibles are compiled from\nancient manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the fourth century C.E.  No\ntwo ancient manuscripts are identical.\n[2]\nAll\nBibles today are produced by combining manuscripts with no single definitive\nreference.  The Bible translators attempt to choose the correct version.  In\nother words, since they do not know which ancient manuscript is the correct\none, they decide for us which version for a given verse to accept.  Take John\n14:26 as an example.  John 14:26 is the only verse of the Bible which\nassociates the\nParakletos\nwith the Holy Spirit.  But the ancient\nmanuscripts are not in agreement that the \nParakletos\n is the ‘Holy\nSpirit.’  For instance, the famous Codex Syriacus, written around the fifth\ncentury C.E., and discovered in 1812 on Mount Sinai, the text of 14:26 reads; Paraclete,\nthe Spirit; and not Paraclete, the\nHoly Spirit\n.\nWhy is it important?  It is significant because\nin biblical language a spirit, simply means a prophet.\nBeloved, believe not every spirit, but try the\nspirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into\nthe world.\n[3]\nIt is instructive to know that several biblical\nscholars considered\nparakletos\nto be an ‘independent salvific (having\nthe power to save) figure,’ not the Holy Ghost.\n[4]\nThe question, then, is: was Jesus’\nparakletos\n,\nComforter, a ‘Holy Ghost’ or a person - a prophet - to come after him?  To\nanswer the question, we must understand the description of\nho parakletos\nand see if it fits a ghost or a human being.\nWhen we continue reading beyond chapter 14:16\nand chapter 16:7, we find that Jesus predicts the specific details of the\narrival and identity of the\nparakletos\n.  Therefore, according to the\ncontext of John 14 & 16 we discover the following facts.\n1.      Jesus said the parakletos is a human being:\nJohn 16:13 He will speak.\nJohn 16:7 …for if I go not away, the\nComforter will not come unto you.\nIt is impossible that the Comforter be the Holy\nGhost because the Holy Ghost was present long before Jesus and during his\nministry.\n[5]\nJohn 16:13 Jesus referred to the paraclete as\n‘he’ and not ‘it’ seven times, no other verse in the Bible contains seven\nmasculine pronouns.  Therefore,\nparaclete\nis a person, not a ghost.\n2.      Jesus is called a parakletos:\nAnd if any man sin, we have an advocate (parakletos)\nwith the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. (1 John 2:1)\nHere we see that\nparakletos is a physical and human intercessor.\n3.      The Divinity of Jesus a later innovation\nJesus was not accepted as divine until the\nCouncil of Nicea, 325 CE, but everyone, except Jews, agree he was a prophet of\nGod, as indicated by the Bible:\nMatthew 21:11 ...This is Jesus the prophet\nof Nazareth of Galilee.\nLuke 24:19 ...Jesus of Nazareth, which was\na prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.\n4.      Jesus prayed to God for another parakletos:\nJohn 14:16 And I will pray the Father, and\nhe shall give you another parakletos.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nVine’s\nExpository Dictionary of New Testament Words.\n[2]\nBesides\nthe larger discrepancies, such as these, there is scarcely a verse in which\nthere is not some variation of phrase in some copies [of the ancient\nmanuscripts from which the Bible has been collected]. No one can say that these\nadditions or omissions or alterations are matters of mere indifference.  ‘Our\nBible and the Ancient Manuscripts,’ by Dr. Frederic Kenyon, Eyre and\nSpottiswoode, p. 3\n.\n[3]\n1\nJohn 4: 1-3\n[4]\n‘...Christian\ntradition has identified this figure (Paraclete) as the Holy Spirit, but\nscholars like Spitta, Delafosse, Windisch, Sasse, Bultmann, and Betz have\ndoubted whether this identification is true to the original picture and have\nsuggested that the Paraclete was once an independent salvific figure, later\nconfused with the Holy Spirit.  ‘the Anchor Bible, Doubleday & Company,\nInc, Garden City, N.Y. 1970, Volume 29A, p. 1135.\n[5]\nGenesis 1: 2, 1\nSamuel 10: 10, 1 Samuel 11: 6, Isaiah 63: 11, Luke 1: 15, Luke 1: 35, Luke 1:\n41, Luke 1: 67, Luke 2: 25, Luke 2: 26, Luke 3:22, John 20: 21-22.",

    "content": "5.      Jesus describes the function of the other Parakletos:\nJohn 16:13 He will guide you into all the\ntruth.\nGod says in the Quran of Muhammad:\nO mankind!  The Messenger has now come unto you with\nthe truth from your Lord: believe, then, for your own good!... (Quran 4:170)\nJohn 16:14 He will glorify Me.\nThe\nQuran brought by Muhammad glorifies Jesus:\n…who shall become known as the Christ Jesus, son of\nMary, of great honor in this world and in the life to come, and [shall be] of\nthose who are drawn near unto God. (Quran 3:45)\nMuhammad also glorified Jesus:\nWhoever testifies that none deserves\nworship except God, who has no partner, and that Muhammad is His servant and\nMessenger, and that Jesus is the servant of God, His Messenger, and His Word\nwhich He bestowed in Mary, and a spirit created from Him, and that Paradise is\ntrue, and that Hell is true, God will admit him into Paradise, according to his\ndeeds. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nJohn 16:8 he will convince the world of\nits sin, and of God’s righteousness, and of the coming judgment.\nThe Quran announces:\nIndeed, they have disbelieved who say, ‘God is the\nChrist, son of Mary’ - seeing that the Christ [himself] said, ‘O Children of Israel!  Worship God [alone], who is my Lord as well as your Lord.’ ‘Indeed, whoever\nascribes divinity to any being beside God, unto him will God deny paradise, and\nhis goal shall be the fire: and there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers!’\n(Quran 5:72)\nJohn 16:13 he shall not speak of himself;\nbut whatsoever he shall hear, [that] shall he speak.\nThe\nQuran says of Muhammad:\nNeither does he speak out of his own desire: that\n[which he conveys to you] is but [a divine] inspiration with which he is being\ninspired. (Quran 53:3-4)\nJohn 14:26 and bring all things to your\nremembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\nThe words of the Quran:\n…while the Messiah had said, ‘O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.’ (Quran 5:72)\n…reminds people of the first and greatest\ncommand of Jesus they have forgotten:\nThe first of all the commandments is, ‘Hear,\nO Israel; the Lord our God is one Lord.’ (Mark 12:29)\nJohn 16:13 and He will disclose to you\nwhat is to come.\nThe Quran states:\nThat is from the news of the unseen which We reveal,\n[O Muhammad], to you… (Quran 12:102)\nHudhaifa, a disciple of Prophet Muhammad, tells\nus:\nThe Prophet once delivered a speech in\nfront of us wherein he left nothing but mentioned everything that would happen\ntill the Hour (of Judgment). (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nJohn 14:16 that he may abide with you for\never.\n…meaning his original teachings will remain\nforever.  Muhammad was God’s last prophet to humanity.\n[1]\nHis\nteachings are perfectly preserved.  He lives in the hearts and minds of his\nadoring followers who worship God in his exact imitation.  No man, including Jesus\nor Muhammad, has an eternal life on earth.\nParakletos\nis not an\nexception either.  This cannot be an allusion to the Holy Ghost, for present\nday creed of the Holy Ghost did not exist until the Council of Chalcedon, in 451\nCE, four and half centuries after Jesus.\nJohn 14:17 he will be the spirit of truth\n…meaning he will be true prophet, see 1 John 4:\n1-3.\nJohn 14:17 the world neither sees him...\nMany people in the world today do not know\nMuhammad.\nJohn 14:17 ...nor knows him\nFewer people recognize the real Muhammad, God’s\nProphet of Mercy.\nJohn 14:26 the Advocate (parakletos)\nMuhammad will be the advocate of humanity at\nlarge and of sinful believers on Judgment Day:\nPeople will look for those who can intercede on\ntheir behalf to God to reduce the distress and suffering on Day of Judgment. \nAdam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus will excuse themselves.\nThen they will come to our Prophet and he will\nsay, I am the one who is able.  So he will intercede for the people in the Great\nPlain of Gathering, so judgment may be passed.  This is the ‘Station of Praise’\nGod promises Him in the Quran:\n…It may be that your Lord will raise you to Station\nof Praise (the honor of intercession on the Day of Resurrection) (Quran 17:79)\n[2]\nProphet Muhammad said:\nMy intercession will be for those of my\nnation who committed major sins. (\nAl-Tirmidhi\n)\nI shall be the first intercessor in Paradise. (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nSome Muslim scholars suggest what Jesus actually\nsaid in Aramaic represents more closely the Greek word\nperiklytos\nwhich\nmeans the ‘admired one.’ In Arabic the word ‘Muhammad’ means the ‘praiseworthy,\nadmired one.’ In other words,\nperiklytos\nis Muhammad in Greek.  We\nhave two strong reasons in its support.  First, due to several documented cases\nof similar word substitution in the Bible, it is quite possible that both words\nwere contained in the original text but were dropped by a copyist because of\nthe ancient custom of writing words closely packed, with no spaces in between. \nIn such a case the original reading would have been, and He will give you\nanother comforter (\nparakletos\n), the admirable one (\nperiklytos\n).  Second,\nwe have the reliable testimony of at least four Muslim authorities from\ndifferent eras who ascribed ‘admired, praised one’ as a possible meaning of the\nGreek or Syriac word to Christians scholars.\n[3]\nThe following are some who attest that the\nParaclete is indeed an allusion to Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God\nbe upon him:\nThe First Witness\nAnselm Turmeda (1352/55-1425 CE), a priest and\nChristian scholar, was a witness to the prophecy.  After accepting Islam he\nwrote a book,\nTuhfat al-arib fi al-radd ‘ala Ahl al-Salib.\nThe Second Witness\nAbdul-Ahad Dawud, the former Rev. David Abdu\nBenjamin Keldani, BD, a Roman Catholic priest of the Uniate-Chaldean sect.\n[4]\nAfter\naccepting Islam, he wrote the book, ‘Muhammad in the Bible.’  He writes in this\nbook:\nThere is not the slightest doubt that by Periqlyte,\nProphet Muhammad, i.e. Ahmad, is intended.\nThe Third Witness\nA synopsis of the life of Muhammad Asad has\nalready been given above.  Commenting on the verse:\n…an apostle who shall come after me, whose name shall\nbe Ahmad (Quran 61:6)\n…where Jesus predicts the coming of Muhammad,\nAsad explains that the word Parakletos:\n…is almost certainly a corruption of Periklytos\n(‘the Much-Praised’), an exact Greek translation of the Aramaic term or name\nMawhamana.  (It is to be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used in\nPalestine at the time of, and for some centuries after, Jesus and was thus\nundoubtedly the language in which the original - now lost - texts of the\nGospels were composed.) In view of the phonetic closeness of Periklytos and\nParakletos it is easy to understand how the translator - or, more probably, a\nlater scribe - confused these two expressions.  It is significant that both the\nAramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have the same meaning as the two\nnames of the Last Prophet, Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from\nthe Hebrew verb hamida (‘he praised’) and the Hebrew noun hamd (‘praise’).\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nQuran 33:40\n.\n[2]\nSee\nalso\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[3]\n‘Sirat Rasul Allah,’ by Ibn Ishaq\n(85-151 CE)p, 103.  ‘Bayn al-Islam wal-Masihiyya: Kitab ‘Abi Ubaida al-Khazraji\n,’ p. 220-221 by Abu Ubaida al-Khazraji (1146-1187 CE) p. 220-221.  ‘Hidaya\ntul-Hayara,’ by Ibn ul-Qayyim, p. 119. ‘al-Riyadh al-Aniqa,’ by al-Suyuti, p.\n129.\n[4]\nRead his biography here: (http://www.muhammad.net/biblelp/bio_keldani.html.)",

(Quran 3:190)\nLike the existence of God, human beings need\nevidence to establish the truth of prophets who spoke in His name.  Muhammad,\nlike the prophets before him, claimed to be God’s final prophet to humanity. \nNaturally, the evidence for his veracity is diverse and numerous.  Some are\nobvious, while others are apparent only after deep reflection.\nGod says in the Quran:\n…Is it not enough (for them to know) that your Lord\nis witness unto everything? (Quran 41:53)\nDivine witness by itself is sufficient without\nany other evidence.  God’s witness for Muhammad lies in:\n(a)  God’s past revelations to earlier prophets which\nprophesize Muhammad’s appearance.\n(b)  God’s Acts: the miracles and ‘signs’ He\ngave to support Muhammad’s claim.\nHow did it all begin in the early days of\nIslam?  How were the first believers convinced he was God’s prophet?\nThe first person to believe in the prophethood\nof Muhammad was his own wife, Khadija.  When he returned home trembling out of\nfear after receiving divine revelation, she was his solace:\nNever!  By God, God will never disgrace\nyou.  You keep good relations with your relatives, help the poor, serve your\nguests generously, and assist those hit with calamities. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nShe saw in her husband a man God would not\nhumiliate, because of his virtues of honesty, justice, and helping the poor.\nHis closest friend, Abu Bakr who had known him\nall his life and was almost the same age, believed the moment he heard the\nwords, ‘\nI am God’s Messenger’\nwithout any additional confirmation other\nthan the open book of his friend’s life.\nAnother person who accepted his call on merely\nlistening to it, was ‘Amr’\n[1]\nHe\nsays:\nI used to think before Islam that people\nwere in error and they were on nothing.  They worshipped idols.  In the meantime,\nI heard of a man preaching in Mecca; so I went to him…I asked him: ‘Who are\nyou?’  He said: ‘I am a Prophet.’  I again said: ‘Who is a Prophet?’  He said:\n‘God sent me.’  I said: ‘What did He send you with?’  He said: ‘I have been\nsent to join ties of relationship, to break the idols, and to proclaim the\nunity of God so nothing is associated with Him (in worship).’  I said: ‘Who is\nwith you in this?’  He said: ‘A free man and a slave (referring to Abu Bakr and\nBilal, a slave, who had embraced Islam by that time).’  I said: ‘I intend to\nfollow you.’ (\nSaheeh Muslim\n)\nDimad was a desert healer who specialized in\nmental illnesses.  On his visit to Mecca he heard the Meccans say that Muhammad\n(may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him) was insane!  Confident of his\nskills, he said to himself, ‘If I were to come across this man, God might cure\nhim at my hand.’  Dimad met the Prophet and said: ‘Muhammad, I can protect\n(one) who suffers from mental illness or under sorcery, and God cures one whom\nHe so desires at my hand.  Do you desire to be cured?’  The Prophet of God\nresponded, starting with his usual introduction to his sermons:\nIndeed, praise and gratitude is for God. \nWe praise Him and ask for His help.  He who God guides, none can lead astray,\nand he who is led astray cannot be guided.  I bear witness no one deserves\nworship but God, He is One, has no partners, and Muhammad is His Servant and\nMessenger.\nDimad, stuck by the beauty of the words, asked\nhim to repeat them, and said, ‘I have heard the words of diviners, sorcerers, and\npoets, but I have never heard such words, they reach the depth of the oceans. \nGive me your hand so I may pledge my allegiance to you on Islam.’\n[2]\nAfter Gabriel brought the first revelation to\nProphet Muhammad, Khadija, his wife, took him to visit her old cousin, Waraqa ibn\nNawfal, a biblical scholar, to discuss the event.  Waraqa recognized Muhammad\nfrom the prophecies of the Bible and confirmed:\nThis is the Keeper of Secrets (Angel\nGabriel) who came to Moses. (S\naheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nThe face can be a window to the soul.  Abdullah ibn\nSalam, the chief rabbi of Medina at the time, looked at the face of the Prophet\nwhen he arrived in Medina, and exclaimed:\nThe moment I looked at his face, I knew it\nwas not the face of a liar! (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nMany of those around the Prophet who did not accept\nIslam did not doubt in his veracity, but refused to do so for other reasons. \nHis uncle, Abu Talib, aided him throughout his life, confessed to the\ntruthfulness of Muhammad, but refused to break off from the religion of his\nancestors out of shame and social status.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nAmr b.

    "content": "A Logical Analysis of His Claim\nAs discussed earlier, Muhammad made the claim, ‘\nI\nam God’s Messenger.’\nEither he was true in his claim or he was not.  We\nwill begin by assuming the latter and investigate all possibilities raised by\nskeptics of past and present, discussing some of their misconceptions.  Only if\nall other possibilities are exhausted can one reasonably claim that the only\npossibility left is that he was true in what he claimed.  We will also look at\nwhat the Quran has to say on the matter.\nWas He a Liar?\nIs it possible for a liar to claim for a period\nof 23 years with unwavering certitude that he is a prophet like Abraham, Moses,\nand Jesus, that there will be no more prophets after him, and that the\nscripture he has been sent with will remain his lasting miracle till the end of\ntime?\nA liar will falter sometimes, perhaps with a\nfriend, maybe with his family members, somewhere he will make a mistake.  His\nmessage, delivered over two decades, will contradict itself sometimes.  But\nwhat we see in reality is that the scripture he brought declares freedom from\ninternal inconsistencies, his message remained consistent throughout his mission,\nand even in the midst of a battle, he proclaimed his prophethood!\n[1]\nHis life story is a preserved book open for\neveryone to read.  Before Islam, he was well-known to his own people to be\ntrustworthy and reliable, an honest man, a person of integrity, who did not\nlie.\n[2]\nIt was due to this reason they named him Al-Ameen, or The Trustworthy He\nwas strongly opposed to lying and warned against it.  Is it possible for him to\ntell a consistent lie for 23 years, a lie so monstrous that it would make him a\nsocial outcast, when he was never known to have lied even once about anything? \nIt’s simply against the psychology of liars.\nIf one was to ask why a person would make claim\nto prophethood and lie, their answer might be one of two:\n1)Fame,\nglory, wealth and status.\n2)Moral\nprogress.\nIf we were to say that Muhammad claimed\nprophethood for fame glory and status, we would see that what actually occurred\nwas the exact opposite.  Muhammad, before his claim to Prophethood, enjoyed a\nhigh status in all aspects.  He was of the most noble of tribes, of the most\nnoble of families, and was known for his truthfulness.  After his claim, he\nbecame a social outcast.  For 13 years in Makkah, he and his followers faced\nexcruciating torture, which led to the death of some of his followers,\nridicule, sanctioning, and excommunication from society.\nThere were many other ways which a person could\ngain fame in the society of that time, mainly from valor, and poetry.  If\nMuhammad had made the claim that he himself authored the Quran, as will be explained\nlater, that would have been enough for his name and poetry to be engraved in\ngold and hung inside the Ka’bah for eternity, people from all over the world\nhallowing him.  Rather, he proclaimed that he was not the author of this\nrevelation, and that it was from the One high above, causing him to be\nridiculed in his time until ours.\nThe Prophet was the husband of a wealthy\ntradeswoman, and he enjoyed the comforts of life available to him at his time.  But\nafter his claim of prophethood, he became of the poorest of people.  Days\npassed without stove fire being lit in his house, and at one time, hunger drove\nhim to the mosque in hope of some provision.  The leaders of Makkah in his time\noffered him the riches of the world in order for him to leave his message.  As\na response to their offer, he recited the verses of the Quran..  The Following\nare some of these verses:\n(As for) those who say: ‘Our Lord is God,’ and,\nfurther, stand straight and steadfast, the angels descend upon them, saying: ‘Fear\nnot, nor be grieved, and receive good news of the garden which you were\npromised.  We are your guardians in this world's life and in the hereafter, and\nyou shall have therein what your souls desire and you shall have therein what\nyou ask for.  A hospitable gift from one Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!’  And who\nis better in speech than one who calls to God, works righteousness, and says, ‘I\nam of those who has submitted in Islam?’  Nor can goodness and evil be equal.  Repel\n(evil) with what is better: Then will he between whom and thee was hatred\nbecome as it were thy friend and intimate.  And no one will be granted such\ngoodness except those who exercise patience and self-restraint,- none but\npersons of the greatest good fortune. (Quran 41:30-35)\nIf one were to say that Muhammad lied and claimed\nprophethood in order to bring moral and religious reform to a society ridden with\nills, this argument is futile in itself, for how can one bring moral reform\nthrough a lie.  If Muhammad was so keen to uphold and preach upright morals and\nworship of One God, then could he have lied himself in doing so?  If we say\nthat this is not possible, the only answer is that he was speaking the truth.  The\nonly other possibility is that he was insane.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n[2]\n‘Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources’ by\nMartin Lings, p. 34.",

    "content": "Was He Insane?\nSomeone who has dealt with mentally ill knows\npeople can be identified by their symptoms.  Muhammad displayed no symptom of\ninsanity at any time in his life  No friend, wife, or family member suspected\nor abandoned him due to insanity.  As for the effects of revelations on the\nProphet, such as perspiration and the likes, it was due to the intensity of the\nMessage which he had to bear and not due to any epileptic fit or instance of\ninsanity...\nQuite to the contrary, Muhammad preached for a\nlong time and brought a Law unknown in its completeness and sophistication to\nancient Arabs.  If the prophet was insane, it would have been obvious to those\naround him at one point in a period of twenty three years.  When in history did\nan insane man preach his message to worship One God for ten years, three of\nwhich he and his followers spent in exile, and eventually became the ruler of\nhis lands?  Which insane man has ever won the hearts and minds of people who\nmet him and earned the respect of his adversaries?\nMore so, his closest companions, Abu Bakr and\nUmar were recognized for their abilities, nobility, skills, and finesse.  They\nwere willing to sacrifice anything for the religion he brought.  On one\noccasion, Abu Bakr, brought all his material possessions to Muhammad, may the\nmercy and blessings of God be upon him, and when asked what he left for his\nfamily, responded, ‘\nI left for them God and His Messenger!’\nAbu Bakr, a merchant by profession, after being\nelected the ruler of all of Arabs after Muhammad, spent a mere two dirham on\nhimself and his family!\nUmar became the ruler of Arabia after Abu Bakr\nand conquered Syria, Egypt, and subdued the Persian and Roman Empires.  He was\na man known for his scrupulous justice.  How can someone suggest these people\nwere following a mentally deranged individual?\nGod suggests: stand before God without bias or\npre-conceived beliefs, and discuss it with another person or think about it\nyourself, this prophet has no madness, he is as stable today as you had known\nhim for forty years.\nSay: ‘I counsel you one thing only: Be (ever­\nconscious of) standing before God, whether you are in the company of others or\nalone; and then bethink yourselves (that) there is no madness in (this prophet,)\nyour fellow-man: he is only a warner to you of suffering severe to come.’ (Quran\n34:46)\nThe Meccans of old rejected his call out of\ntribal partisanship, and they were not truthful in their accusations of his insanity.\nEven today, many people  refuse to accept Muhammad as a prophet simply because\nhe was an Arab and self-gratify themselves by saying he must have been insane\nor worked for the devil.  Their hatred for Arabs translates into their\nrejection of Muhammad, even though God says:\nNay, but he (whom you call a mad poet) has brought\nthe truth; and he confirms the truth of (what the earlier of God’s)\nmessage-bearers (have taught). (Quran 37:37)\nAlthough the pagan Arabs knew Muhammad all too\nwell, but they still threw accusations of insanity at him, for they considered\nhis religion a sacrilege against the tradition of their forefathers.\nAnd when our verses are recited to them as clear\nevidences, they say, ‘This is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that\nwhich your fathers were worshipping.’  And they say, ‘This is not except a lie\ninvented.’  And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them,\n‘This is not but obvious magic.’  And We had not given them any scriptures\nwhich they could study, and We had not sent to them before you, (O Muhammad),\nany warner.  And those before them denied, and they (the people of Mecca) have not attained a tenth of what We had given them.  But they (i.e., the former\npeoples) denied My messengers, so how (terrible) was My reproach. (Quran\n34:43-45)\nWas He A Poet?\nGod mentions their accusation in the Quran and\nresponds to it:\nOr do they say (of you), ‘A poet for whom we await a\nmisfortune of time?’  Say, ‘Wait, for indeed I am, with you, among the\nwaiters.’  Or do their minds command them to (say) this, or are they a\ntransgressing people?  Or do they say, ‘He has made it up?’  Rather, they do\nnot believe. (Quran 52:30-33)\nGod describes the poets of that time so the\nProphet can be compared with them:\nAnd as for the poets - (they, too, are prone to\ndeceive themselves: and so, only) those who are lost in grievous error would\nfollow them.  Art thou not aware that they roam confusedly through all the\nvalleys (of words and thoughts)\n[1]\n,\nand that they (so often) say what they do not do (or feel)?  (Most of them are\nof this kind -) save those who have attained to faith, and do righteous deeds,\nand remember God unceasingly, and defend them­selves (only) after having been\nwronged, and (trust in God’s promise that) those who are bent on wrong­doing\nwill in time come to know how evil a turn their destinies are bound to take!\n(Quran 26:224-227)\nArabian poets were the furthest from the truth,\nspeaking of wine, womanizing, war, and leisure, unlike the Prophet who invites\nto good manners, serving God, and helping the poor.  Muhammad followed his own\nteachings before anyone else unlike the poets of old or philosophers of today.\nThe Quran which the Prophet recited was unlike\nany poetry in its style.  The Arabs of the time has strict rules in regards to rhythm,\nrhyme, syllables and endings to each verse of poetry.  The Quran did not\nconform to any of the rules which were known in the time, but at the same time,\nit surpasses any type of text which the Arabs had ever heard.  Some of them\nactually became Muslims after hearing only a few verses of the Quran, due to\ntheir certain knowledge that the source of something so beautiful could not be\nany created being..\nMuhammad was never known to have composed a poem\nbefore Islam or after prophethood.  Rather, the Prophet had a sever dislike for\nit.  Compilations of his statements, called Sunna, have been diligently\npreserved and are completely different in its literary content than the Quran. \nThe store-house of Arabic poetry does not contain any couplets by Muhammad.\nWas He A Sorcerer?\nProphet Muhammad never learned or practiced\nsorcery.  On the contrary, he condemned the practice of sorcery and taught his\nfollowers how to seek protection against it.\nSorcerers have a strong relationship with the\ndevil.  Their partnership allows them to deceive people.  Devils propagate\nlies, sins, obscenities, immorality, evil, and they destroy families.  The Quran\nclarifies those upon whom the devils descend:\nShall I inform you upon whom the devils descend?  They\ndescend upon every sinful liar.  They pass on what is heard, and most of them\nare liars. (Quran 26:221-223)\nProphet Muhammad was known and recognized to be\na man of integrity true to his word who was not known to have ever lied.  He\ncommanded good morals and fine manners.  No sorcerer in world history has\nbrought a scripture like the Quran or a Law like his.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe idiomatic phrase is used, as most of the\ncommentators point out, to describe a confused or aimless - and often\nself-contradictory - play with words and thoughts. In this context it is meant\nto stress the difference between the precision of the Quran, which is free from\nall inner contradictions, and the vagueness often inherent in poetry.",

    "content": "Apart from the greatest miracle given to him,\nthe Quran, Prophet Muhammad performed many physical miracles witnessed by his\ncontemporaries numbering in hundreds, and in some cases thousands.\n[1]\nThe miracle reports have reached us by a reliable and strong method of\ntransmission unmatched in world history.  It is as if the miracles were\nperformed in front of our eyes.  The meticulous method of transmission is what\nconvinces us that Muhammad indeed performed these great miracles with divine\naid and, thus, we can believe him when he said, ‘\nI am God’s Messenger\n.’\nMuhammad’s great miracles were witnessed by\nthousands of believers and skeptics, following which verses of the Quran were\nrevealed mentioning the supernatural events.  The Quran made some miracles\neternal by etching them in the conscious of the believers.  The ancient\ndetractors would simply remain silent when these verses were recited.  Had\nthese miracles not taken place, they would have seized the moment to scandalize\nit and belie Muhammad.  But rather, the opposite took place.  The believers\ngrew more certain of the truth of Muhammad and the Quran.  The fact that the\nfaithful grew stronger in their faith and the silence of the unbelievers and\nnot denying their occurrence is acknowledgment from both that the miracles took\nplace exactly as the Quran describes.\nIn this section we will discuss some of the\nphysical miracles performed by Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be\nupon him.\nMiracles are from Divine Power\nA miracle is one\nof the factors which further strengthens the claim of a prophet of God. (full\nstop needed)  Miracles should not be the soul essence of belief, as\nsupernatural events can also take place by the use of magic and devils.  The\ntruth of prophethood is clear and evident in the actual message brought, as God\nhas instilled a capability, although limited, in humans to recognize the truth\nas it is, specifically in the matter of monotheism.  But in order to further\nstrengthen the argument of Prophethood, God performed miracles at the hands of\nHis Prophets from Moses, Jesus to Muhammad.  For this reason, God did\nnot\nproduce miracles upon the demand of the Meccans, but\nthe Wise God gave Muhammad the miracles He desired at the time He choose:\n“And they say, ‘We will not believe you until you\nbreak open for us from the ground a spring, or [until] you have a garden of date-palms\n and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance] or\nyou make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have claimed or you bring\nGod and the angels before [us] or you have a house of ornament [gold] or you\nascend into the sky.  And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension\nuntil you bring down to us a book we may read.’  ‘Say, Exalted is my Lord!  Was\nI ever but a human messenger?’’’ (Quran 17:90-93)\nThe answer was:\n“And nothing has prevented Us from sending [this\nmessage, like the earlier ones,] with miraculous signs [in its wake], save [Our\nknowledge] that the people of olden times [only too often] gave the lie to\nthem: thus, We provided for [the tribe of] Thamud the she-camel as a visible\nsign, but they wronged her.  And never did We send those signs for any other\npurpose than to convey a warning.” (Quran 17:59)\nWhen demanded ostensibly, God in His wisdom knew\nthey would not believe, so He refused to show them miracles:\n“Now they swear by God with their most solemn oaths\nthat if a miracle were shown to them, they would indeed believe in this [divine\nwrit].  Say: ‘Miracles are in the power of God alone.’  ‘And for all you know,\neven if one should be shown to them, they would not believe so long as We keep\ntheir hearts and their eyes turned [away from the truth], even as they did not\nbelieve in it in the first instance: and [so] We shall leave them in their\noverweening arrogance, blindly stumbling to and fro.’” (Quran 6:109-110)\nWe gather here some of the major physical\nmiracles performed by Prophet Muhammad.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe miracles add up to over a thousand.  See ‘\nMuqaddima\nSharh\n’\nSaheeh Muslim\n’ by\nal-Nawawi\nand ‘\nal-Madkhal\n’ by\nal-Baihaqi\n.",

    "content": "Splitting of the Moon\nOne of the times when God performed miracles at\nthe hand of the Prophet was  when the Meccans demanded to see a miracle from\nMuhammad to show his truthfulness.  God split the moon in two separate halves\nand then re-joined them.  The Quran recorded the event:\n“The Last Hour draws near, and the moon is split\nasunder!” (Quran 54:1)\nProphet Muhammad would recite these verses of\nthe Quran in large congregations of the weekly Friday prayer and the bi-annual\nEed prayers.\n[1]\nHad\nthe event never occurred, Muslims themselves would have doubted their religion\nand many would have left it!  The Meccans would have said, ‘Hey, your prophet\nis a liar, the moon never split, and we never saw it split!’  Instead, the\nbelievers grew stronger in their faith and the only explanation the Meccans\ncould come up with was, ‘passing magic!’\n“The Last Hour draws near, and the moon is split\nasunder!  And if they see a sign (miracle), they turn away and say, ‘Passing\nmagic!’- for they are bent on giving it the lie, being always wont to follow\ntheir own desires.” (Quran 54:1-3)\nThe splitting of the moon is confirmed through\neye-witness testimony transmitted through an unbroken chain of reliable scholars\nso many that it is impossible that it could be false (\nhadith mutawatir\n).\n[2]\nA skeptic might ask, do we have any independent\nhistorical evidence to suggest the moon was ever split?  After all, people\naround the world should have seen this marvelous event and recorded it.\nThe answer to this question is twofold.\nFirst, people around the world could not have\nseen it as it would have been daytime, late night, or early morning in many\nparts of the world.  The following table will give the reader some idea of\ncorresponding world times to 9:00 pm Mecca time:\nCountry\nTime\nMecca\n9:00 pm\nIndia\n11:30 pm\nPerth\n2:00 am\nReykjavik\n6:00 pm\nWashington D.C.\n2:00 pm\nRio de Janeiro\n3:00 pm\nTokyo\n3:00 am\nBeijing\n2:00 am\nAlso, it is not likely that a large number of\npeople in lands close by would be observing the moon at the exact same time. \nThey had no reason to.  Even if some one did, it does not necessarily mean\npeople believed him and kept a written record of it, especially when many\ncivilizations at that time did not preserve their own history in writing.\nSecond, we actually have an independent, and\nquite amazing, historical corroboration of the event from an Indian king of\nthat time.\nKerala is a state of India.  The state stretches\nfor 360 miles (580 kilometers) along the Malabar Coast on the southwestern side\nof the Indian peninsula.\n[3]\nKing\nChakrawati Farmas of Malabar was a Chera king, Cheraman perumal of Kodungallure. \nHe is recorded to have seen the moon split.  The incident is documented in a\nmanuscript kept at the India Office Library, London, reference number: Arabic,\n2807, 152-173.\n[4]\nA\ngroup of Muslim merchant’s passing by Malabar on their way to China spoke to the king about how God had supported the Arabian prophet with the miracle of\nsplitting of the moon.  The shocked king said he had seen it with his own eyes\nas well, deputized his son, and left for Arabia to meet the Prophet in person. \nThe Malabari king met the Prophet, bore the two testimonies of faith, learned\nthe basics of faith, but passed away on his way back and was buried in the port\ncity of Zafar, Yemen.\n[5]\nIt is said that the contingent was led by a\nMuslim, Malik ibn Dinar, and continued to Kodungallure, the Chera capital, and\nbuilt the first, and India’s oldest, mosque in the area in 629 CE which exists\ntoday.\nA pre-renovation picture of the Cheraman Juma\nMasjid, India’s oldest mosque dating back to 629 CE.  Image courtesy of www.islamicvoice.com.\nThe news of his accepting Islam reached Kerala\nwhere people accepted Islam.  The people of Lakshadweep and the Moplas\n(Mapillais) from the Calicut province of Kerala are converts from those days.\nCheraman Juma Masjid, named after India’s first Muslim convert, Cheraman perumal Chakrawati Farmas, after renovation.  Image\ncourtesy of www.indianholiday.com.\nThe Indian sighting and the meeting of the\nIndian king with Prophet Muhammad is also reported by Muslim sources.  The\nfamous Muslim historian, Ibn Kathir, mentions the splitting of the moon was\nreported in parts of India.\n[6]\nAlso,\nthe books of hadith have documented the arrival of the Indian king and his\nmeeting the Prophet.  Abu Sa’id al-Khudri, a companion of Prophet Muhammad,\nstates:\n“The Indian king gifted the Prophet with a\njar of ginger.  The companions ate it piece by piece.  I took a bite as well.”\n[7]\nThe king was thus considered a ‘companion’ – a\nterm used for a person who met the Prophet and died as a Muslim – his name\nregistered in the mega-compendiums chronicling the Prophet’s companions.\n[8]\nNight Journey and Ascent to Heaven\nA few months before the migration from Mecca to Medina, God took Muhammad in one night from the Grand Mosque in Mecca to al-Aqsa\nMosque in Jerusalem, a month’s journey of 1230 Km for a caravan.  From Jerusalem, he ascended to the heavens, passing the boundaries of the physical universe to\nbe in divine presence, meet God, and witness the Great Signs (\nal-Ayat\nul-Kubra\n).  His truth became apparent in two ways.  First, ‘the Prophet\ndescribed the caravans he had overtaken on the way home and said where they\nwere and about when they might be expected to arrive in Mecca; and each arrived\nas predicted, and the details were as he had described.’\n[9]\nSecond, he was never known to have been to Jerusalem, yet he described al-Aqsa\nMosque to skeptics like an eye-witness.\nThe mystical journey is mentioned in the Quran:\n“Exalted is He who took His Servant [Prophet Muhammad]\nby night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We\nhave blessed, to show him of Our signs.  Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing.”\n(Quran 17:1)\n“So will you dispute with him over what he saw?  And\nhe certainly saw him in another descent at the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary\n– near it is the Garden of Refuge (Paradise) – when there covered the Lote Tree\nthat which covered (it).  The sight (of the Prophet) did not swerve, nor did it\ntransgress (its limit).  He certainly saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.” (Quran\n53:12-18)\nThe event is also confirmed through eye-witness\ntestimony transmitted through the ages with an unbroken chain of reliable\nscholars (\nhadith mutawatir\n).\n[10]\nEntrance of Al-Aqsa Mosque from where Muhammad\nascended the heavens.  Picture courtesy of  Thekra A.

    "content": "There are many other miracles which the Prophet\nperformed related in the Sunnah, or conglomeration of the sayings, deeds,\napprovals, and descriptions of the Prophet.\nThe Tree Trunk\nIn Medina Muhammad used to deliver sermons leaning on a\ntree stump.  When the number of worshippers increased, someone suggested a\npulpit be built so he can use it to deliver the sermon.  When the pulpit was\nbuilt, he abandoned the tree trunk.  Abdullah ibn Umar, one of the companions,\ngave an eye-witness testimony of what happened.  The trunk was heard weeping, the\nProphet of mercy went towards it and comforted it with his hand.\n[1]\nThe event is also confirmed through eye-witness\ntestimony transmitted through the ages with an unbroken chain of reliable\nscholars (\nhadith mutawatir\n).\n[2]\nThe Flowing of Water\nOn more than one occasion when people were in dire need\nof water, the blessing of the Muhammad saved them.  In the sixth year after the\nhe migrated from Mecca to Medina, Muhammad went to Mecca for pilgrimage.  In\nthe long journey through the desert, people ran out of all water, only the\nProphet was left with a vessel with which he performed ablution for prayers.  He\nput his hand in the vessel, water began flowing from between his fingers. \nJabir ibn Abdullah, who witnessed the miracle, says of the fifteen hundred men,\n‘We drank it and made ablution.’\n[3]\nThis miracle has been transmitted with an unbroken chain of reliable scholars (\nhadith\nmutawatir\n).\n[4]\nThe sprouting of water from human fingers is similar to\nthe Moses’ miracle of producing water from a rock.\nBlessing of Food\nOn more than one occasion, the Prophet blessed food by\neither praying or touching it so all present could get their fill.  This\nhappened at times when food and water shortage afflicted Muslims.\n[5]\nThese miracles took place in the presence of a large number of people and is,\nthus, not possible to deny.\nHealing the Sick\nAbdullah ibn Ateek broke his leg and Muhammad\nhealed it by wiping his hand over it.  Abdullah said it was as if nothing had\nhappened to it!  The person who witnessed the miracle was another companion,\nBara’ ibn Azib (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nDuring the expedition of Khyber, Muhammad healed the\npainful eyes of Ali ibn Abi Talib in front of a whole army.  Ali, many years\nlater, became the fourth caliph of Muslims.\n[6]\nExorcising Devils\nMuhammad exorcised the devil out of a boy brought by his\nmother for healing to him by saying, ‘\nCome out!  I am Muhammad, the\nMessenger of God!\n’  The woman said, ‘By the One who sent you with the\ntruth, we have never seen anything wrong with him since.’\n[7]\nPrayers Answered\n(1) The mother of Abu Hurayra, a close companion of\nMuhammad, used to speak ill of Islam and its prophet.  One day, Abu Hurayra\ncame weeping to Muhammad and asked him to pray for his mother to be saved. \nMuhammad prayed and when Abu Hurayra returned home he found his mother ready to\naccept Islam.  She bore the testimony of faith in front of her son and entered\nIslam.\n[8]\n(2) Jarir ibn Abdullah was commissioned by the Prophet\nto rid the land of an idol worshipped besides God, but he complained he was\ncould not ride a horse well!  The Prophet prayed for him, ‘O God, make him a\nstrong horseman and make him one who guides and is guided .’  Jarir testifies\nhe never fell off his horse after the Prophet prayed for him.\n[9]\n(3) The people were struck with famine during the time\nof Muhammad.  A man stood up when Muhammad was delivering the weekly sermon on\nFriday, and said, ‘O Messenger of God, our wealth has been destroyed and our\nchildren are starving.  Pray to God for us.’  Muhammad raised his hands in\nprayer.\nThose in attendance testify that that the moment he\nlowered his hands after praying, clouds began to build like mountains!\nBy the time he stepped down off his pulpit, rain was\ndripping from his beard!\nIt rained the whole week till next Friday!\nThe same man stood up again, complained this time, ‘O\nMessenger of God, our buildings are destroyed, and our property is drowned,\npray to God for us!’\nMuhammad raised his hands and prayed, ‘O God, (let it\nrain) around us, but not on us.’\nThose in attendance testify that the clouds withdrew in\nthe direction he pointed, the city of Medina was surrounded by clouds, but\nthere were no clouds over it!\n[10]\n(4) Here is the beautiful story of Jabir.  He testifies\nthat one time, the camel he was riding was exhausted because it was used for\ncarrying water.  The camel could hardly walk.  Muhammad asked him, ‘What’s the\nmatter with your camel?’  On finding out how tired the poor camel was, Muhammad\nprayed for the poor animal and from that time, Jabir tells us, the camel was\nalways ahead of others!  Muhammad asked Jabir, ‘How do you find your camel?’  Jabir\nresponded, ‘It is well, your blessing has reached it!’  Muhammad bought the\ncamel from Jabir on the spot for a piece of gold, with the condition that Jabir\nride it back to the city!  On reaching Medina, Jabir says he brought the camel\nto Muhammad the next morning.  Muhammad gave him the piece of gold and told him\nto keep his camel!\n[11]\nIt is no wonder why those around him who witnessed these\ngreat miracles performed in front of crowds were certain of his truthfulness.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n.\n[2]\nMore than ten\ncompanions of the Prophet transmitted the reports on their hearing the weeping\nof the tree trunk.  See the works of hadith masters: ‘Azhar al-Mutanathira fi\nal-Ahadith al-Mutawatira’ by al-Suyuti p. 267, ‘Nadhm al-Mutanathira min\nal-Hadith al-Mutawatir,’ by al-Kattani p. 209 and ‘Shamail’ of Ibn Kathir p.\n239.\n[3]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n.\n[4]\nMore than ten\ncompanions of the Prophet transmitted the reports on their hearing the weeping\nof the tree trunk.  See ‘\nNadhm al-Mutanathira min al-Hadith al-Mutawatir\n,’\nby al-Kattani p. 212, ‘\nal-Shifa\n’ by Qadhi Iyyad, vol 1, p. 405, and ‘\nal-’Ilaam\n’\nby al-Qurtubi, p. 352.\n[5]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n.\n See ‘\nNadhm al-Mutanathira min al-Hadith al-Mutawatir\n,’ by al-Kattani p.\n213 and ‘\nal-Shifa\n’ by Qadhi Iyyad, vol 1, p. 419.\n[6]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n[7]\nMusnad of Imam Ahmad\n,\nand\nSharh’ al-Sunnah\n[8]\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n[9]\nSaheeh Muslim\n[10]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhar\n,\nSaheeh Muslim\n[11]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhar\n,\nSaheeh\nMuslim",

    "content": "Rays from the Same Lamp\nA natural question to ask someone who believes\nin any prophet is: ‘What are the criteria for your belief in him?’  Reasonable\ncriteria would be:\n(i)\nevidence\nfor his claim.\n(ii)\nconsistency\nin his teachings\n(about God, afterlife, and similar issues of belief)\n(iii)\nsimilarity\nto the teachings of\nearlier prophets.\n(iv)\nintegrity\n: he must be a man of\nhigh morals.\nThe Bible lends support to our criteria.  The\nOld Testament says of a false prophet:\n1.    Pretends to be sent by God.\n[1]\n2.    Described as covetous,\n[2]\ndrunken,\n[3]\nimmoral\nand profane,\n[4]\ninfluenced\nby evil spirits.\n[5]\n3.    Prophesizes falsely,\n[6]\nlies in the name of the Lord,\n[7]\nout\nof his own heart,\n[8]\nin\nthe name of false gods.\n[9]\n4.    Often practices divination and witchcraft.\n[10]\n5.    Leads people into error\n,\n[11]\nmakes to forget God’s name,\n[12]\nteaches\nprofaneness and sin,\n[13]\nand oppresses.\n[14]\nThe New Testament says of Jesus’ criteria to\nidentify false prophets:\nBeware of false prophets, which come to\nyou in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  Ye shall know\nthem by their fruits.  Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  Even\nso every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth\nevil fruit.\n[15]\nWe learn the following:\n(i)   prophecy will continue after Jesus.\n(ii)  beware of false prophets.\n(iii) the criteria to identify a false\nprophet is his fruits, that is his works or deeds.\n[16]\nAs stated earlier, Muhammad claimed\nunequivocally, ‘I am God’s Messenger.’  If a person evaluates his claim on the\nabove criteria, he will find it meets the criteria completely.\nIn Islamic doctrine, all prophets constitute a\nspiritual fraternity of brothers with a single ‘father,’ but different\n‘mothers.’  The ‘father’ is prophethood and unity of God, the ‘mothers’ are the\ndifferent Laws they brought.  Emphasizing the spiritual fraternity of all\nprophets, Prophet Muhammad said:\nI am the closest of all people to the son\nof Mary (Jesus).  The prophets are paternal brothers, their mothers are\ndifferent, but their religion is one. (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim\n)\nAll prophets are ‘rays’ from the same ‘Lamp’:\nthe central message of all prophets throughout ages was to dedicate worship to\nGod only.  That’s why Islam views denying a single prophet as equivalent to\ndenying them all.  The Quran states:\nIndeed, those who deny God and His messengers, and\nwish to separate God from His messengers, saying: ‘We believe in some but\nreject others’ and want to pursue a path in-between - it is they, they who are\ntruly denying the truth: and for those who deny the truth We have readied\nshameful suffering.  But as for those who believe in God and His messengers and\nmake no distinction between any of them - unto them, in time, will He grant\ntheir rewards [in full].  And God is indeed much-forgiving, a dispenser of\ngrace. (Quran 4:150-152)\nDenying the prophethood of Muhammad is\ntantamount to denying all prophets.  The prophethood of Muhammad is known just\nlike the prophethood of Moses and Jesus is known: the numerous reports of their\nmiracles that have reached us.  The Book brought by Muhammad (the Quran) is\nfully preserved, and His Law is complete and applicable to today’s world. \nMoses brought the Law and justice, Jesus brought grace and flexibility. \nMuhammad combined between the Law of Moses and the grace of Jesus.\nIf someone were to say, ‘he was an imposter,’\nothers are more fit to be charged with this accusation.  Hence, denying\nMuhammad is denying one’s own prophets.  If a reasonable person looks at two\nbright stars, he must acknowledge both are stars, he cannot say to one, ‘Yes,\nthis one is a bright star,’ but deny the other!  Doing so would be denying\nreality and a lie.\nMake a table of all the prophets you believe\nin.  Start from the first one to the last one you believe in.  Answer the\nfollowing questions:\nWhat is the evidence I believe he was a true\nprophet?\nWhat was the mission of the prophet in his own\nwords?\nDid he bring a Law?  Is his Law applicable\ntoday?\nWhat scripture did he bring?  How is its content\nand meaning?\nIs the scripture preserved in the original\nlanguage it was revealed in?  Is it considered a literary authority, free of\ninternal inconsistencies?\nWhat do you know of his morals and integrity?\nCompare all the prophets you have listed and\nthen answer the same questions about Muhammad.  Then ask yourself, ‘Can I honestly\ntake Muhammad out of my list because he does not meet the criteria as other\nprophets?’  It will not take too much effort to discover that the evidence for\nMuhammad’s prophethood is stronger and more convincing.\nA skeptic need consider what is so unusual about\nMuhammad’s claim to be a prophet?  When did God declare an end to prophecy\nbefore him?  Who decided that there would not be any more divine communication\nwith human beings?  With no evidence to block divine revelation, it is natural\nto accept a continuity of revelation:\nIndeed, We have sent you with the truth, as a bearer\nof glad tidings and a Warner: for there never was any community but a Warner has\n[lived and] passed away in its midst. (Quran 35:24)\nAnd We sent forth Our messengers, one after another:\n[and] every time their messenger came to a community, they gave him the lie:\nand so We caused them to follow one another [into the grave], and let them\nbecome [mere] tales: and so - away with the folk who would not believe! (Quran\n23:44)\nThis is true especially when the truth was\nperverted by Jews and Christians, the Christians claiming Jesus was the son of\nGod and Jews calling him an illegitimate son of Joseph the Carpenter.  Muhammad\nbrought the truth: Jesus was God’s noble prophet born of a miraculous virgin\nbirth.  As a result, Muslims believe in Jesus and love him, neither going to\nthe extreme like the Christians, nor disparaging him like the Jews.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nJer\n23:\n17,18,31\n[2]\nMic 3:11\n[3]\nIsa 28:7\n[4]\nJer 23:11,14\n[5]\n1Ki 22:21,22\n[6]\nJer 5:31\n[7]\nJer 14:14\n[8]\nJer 23:16,26; Eze 13:2\n[9]\nJer 2:8\n[10]\nJer 14:14; Eze 22:28; Act 13:6\n[11]\nJer 23:13; Mic 3:5\n[12]\nJer 23:27\n[13]\nJer 23:14,15\n[14]\nEze\n22:25\n[15]\nMatthew 7:15-17 (King James Version)\n[16]\nAccording to ‘Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New\nTestament Words.’",

    "content": "Entering Mecca’s Grand Mosque (\nal-Masjid al-Haram\n)\nIn the sixth year after the Prophet was forced to migrate\nfrom Mecca to Medina, he saw himself visiting Mecca and performing pilgrimage\nin a vision mentioned in the Quran:\nCertainly has God showed to His Messenger the vision (i.e.\ndream) in truth.  You will surely enter\nal-Haram\nmosque, if God wills,\nin safety, with your heads shaved and [hair] shortened\n[1]\n,\nnot fearing [anyone].  He knew what you did not know and has arranged before that\na conquest near [at hand]. (Quran 48:27)\nGod made three promises:\n(a)  Muhammad would enter into Mecca’s Grand Mosque.\n(b)  Muhammad would enter in a state of\nsecurity.\n(c)  Muhammad and his companions would get\nto perform pilgrimage and fulfill its rituals.\nIgnoring the hostility of Meccans, Prophet\nMuhammad gathered his companions and embarked on a peaceful journey to Mecca.  But the Meccans continued to be hostile and he was forced to return to Medina.  The vision remained unfulfilled; however, an important treaty was signed between\nthe Prophet and the Meccans, which would prove of great significance.  It is due\nto this treaty that Muhammad performed a peaceful pilgrimage with his\ncompanions the very next year.  The vision had found its fulfillment.\n[2]\nThe Quranic Prophecy; ‘The Unbelievers Will Lose’\nMuslims were subject to severe persecution in Mecca at the hand of pagans.  At one time they were boycotted for three years, and the perpetual\nshortage of food sometimes bordered on famine.\n[3]\nAny talk of victory was unimaginable.  Despite all odds, God prophesized in Mecca:\n[The pagans’] assembly will be defeated, and they\nshall turn their backs [in flight]!. (Quran 54:45)\nThe Arabic verb\nyuhzamu\nis preceded by\nsa\n(an Arabic prefix denoting the future tense), making it a distinct prophecy\nawaiting fulfillment in future.  And so it was in the holy month of Ramadan,\ntwo years after the Prophet’s migration from Mecca to Medina that the Meccans\nwere defeated in the Battle of Badr and forced to retreat.\n[4]\nUmar, the second caliph of the Muslims after the Prophet, used to say that they\ndid not know how the Quranic prophecy would be fulfilled until they themselves\nwitnessed it coming true at the famous battle of Badr! (\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n)\nThe Quranic Prophecy; ‘Believers Will Get Political\nAuthority’\nDespite severe\noppression at the hands of Meccans, Muslims were given good news from\nGod:\nGod has promised those who have believed among you\nand done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to\nauthority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that\nHe will surely establish [therein] their religion which He has preferred for\nthem and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security,\n[for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me.  But whoever\ndisbelieves after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient. (Quran\n24:55)\nHow such a promise from Almighty God would be\nfulfilled to the oppressed, brutalized Muslims in Mecca was impossible to\nimagine at the time it was made.  It was  fulfilled, nevertheless.  Indeed, God\nmade Muslims secure and gave them political sway in a matter of years.\nAnd Our word [decree] has already preceded for Our slaves,\nthe messengers, [that] indeed, they would be those given victory. (Quran\n37:171-172)\nAt first, the Muslims established their own\nstate, by the invitation of the people of Medina, when God commanded they\nmigrate there from Mecca.  Then, within the lifetime of the Prophet, that state\nexpanded to hold sway over the whole of the Arabian Peninsula, from the Gulf of\nAqaba and the Arabian Gulf to the Arabian Sea in the south, including the place\nfrom whence the Muslims had been driven out (Mecca itself).  This decree was\nongoing, for the expansion of the Muslim political and religious dominion did\nnot stop at the Arabian Peninsula.  History gives a living testimony that the\nMuslims addressed by these verses ruled the lands of the former Persian and\nRoman empires, an expansion that amazed and won admiration of world historians. \nIn the words of Encyclopedia Britannica:\nWithin\n12 years after Muhammad’s death, the armies of Islam took possession of Syria, Iraq, Persia,  Armenia, Egypt, and Cyrenaica (in modern Libya).\n[5]\nThe Quran’s Prophecy Regarding the Hypocrites and the\nTribe of Banu Nadhir\nGod says in the Quran:\nSurely, if they are expelled, never will they\n(hypocrites) go out with them, and if they are attacked, they will never help\nthem.  And if they do help them, they (hypocrites) will turn their backs, so\nthey will not be victorious. (Quran 59:12)\nPickthall\n(For) indeed if they are driven out they go not\nout with them, and indeed if they are attacked they help them not, and indeed\nif they had helped them they would have turned and fled, and then they would\nnot have been victorious.\nHave you not observed how those who are hypocrites, tell\ntheir brothers\n(i.e. associates)\namong\nthe People of the Scripture who disbelieved, ‘If you are expelled, we will\nsurely also leave with you, and we will never anyone against you; and if you\nare attacked\n(i.e. by the Muslim militia)\n,\nwe will surely aid you.’  But God bears witness that they are liars.  If they\n(i.e. the Jews)\nare expelled, they\n(i.e. the hypocrites)\nwill not leave with\nthem, and if they are fought, they will not aid them.  And [even] if they were\nto aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then they will not be aided. (Quran\n59:11-12)\nThe prophecy was fulfilled when the Banu Nadhir\nwere expelled in August 625 CE from Medina; the hypocrites did not accompany\nthem or come to their aid.\n[6]\nThe Quranic Prophecies concerning Future\nConfrontations\nThey will not harm you except for [some] annoyance.  And\nif they fight you, they will show you their backs\n(i.e., flee)\n; then they will not be aided. (Quran 3:111)\nAnd if those (Meccans) who disbelieve were to fight\nyou, they would certainly turn their backs\n(i.e.,\nflee)\n.  Then they would not find a protector or a helper. (Quran 48:22)\nHistorically, after these verses were revealed,\nthe unbelievers in the Arabian Peninsula were never able to withstand the Muslims\nagain.\n[7]\nWe see from the prophecies discussed in these\narticles that the claim many detractors of Muhammad’s Prophethood are utterly\nunfounded.  They have based their criticism on the challenge to show that what\nMuhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, foretold, if\nanything, and what came true of his foretelling.\n[8]\nDemonstrably, he did prophesize, with God’s guidance, and demonstrably, what\nhe was directed to tell us did actually occur.  Therefore, by the criterion of\nthe detractors, Muhammad was the Messenger of God, and the last of the prophets\nto be sent, by both his statements in the Sunnah (narrations from his life) and\nthe word of the Quran.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSome\nof the rites of Hajj.\n[2]\nSee\n‘Mercy For the Worlds,’ by Qazi Suliman Mansoorpuri, vol.1, p. 212 and ‘Madinan\nSociety At The Time Of The Prophet,’ by Dr. Akram Diya al Umari, vol. 2, p.\n139.\n[3]\n‘Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources’ by\nMartin Lings, p. 89.\n[4]\n‘Mercy\nFor the Worlds,’ by Qazi Suliman Mansoorpuri, vol. 3 p. 299 ‘Madinan Society At\nThe Time Of The Prophet,’ by Dr. Akram Diya al Umari, vol. 2, p. 37.\n[5]\narts, Islamic.

    "content": "Heraclius Receives News of Muhammad\nIbn al-Natur was the Governor of Jerusalem for Heraclius,\nwho was the head of the Christians of Greater Syria.  Ibn al-Natur narrates\nthat once, while he was in Jerusalem:\nHeraclius got up in the morning in a sad\nmood.  Some of the priests asked him why.\nBeing one who practiced astrology, Heraclius had\nbeen attempting to map out the future.\nIn reply to the enquiry, he said, “Last\nnight I was looking at the stars, and I saw that a leader of those who practice\ncircumcision had appeared (and would conqueror all before him).  Who are they\nwho practice circumcision?”\nThe priests replied, “Except the Jews\nnobody practices circumcision, and you needn’t be afraid of them; just issue orders\nto kill every Jew present in the country.”\nWhile they were discussing it, a messenger\nsent by the King of Ghassan\n[1]\nto convey the news of the Messenger of God to Heraclius was brought in.\n(This news may have been the actual letter from\nthe Prophet)\nHaving heard the news, Heraclius ordered\nthe priest check whether the messenger from Ghassan was circumcised.  After\nhaving him physically examined, they reported that the man was circumcised.  Heraclius\nthen asked the messenger about the custom of the Arabs.  The messenger replied,\n“Arabs also practice circumcision.”\nWhen he heard this, Heraclius said, “The\nreign of the Arabs has began and their kingdom is about to become manifest.”\n[2]\nThe following story is taken from the narratives\nby the companions of the Prophet.  The story was told by Abu Sufyan to Abdullah\nIbn Abbas, who related it to others.\n[3]\nIbn Abbas\nwas a very devoted student to Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be\nupon him, and a well respected scholar of the Quran.\nAbu Sufyan’s Meeting with Heraclius Caesar\nIn 629CE, three years before the death of the\nMessenger of God, Heraclius re-conquered Jerusalem triumphantly bearing what\nwas said to be the original cross venerated by the Christians, and which the\nKhosrau II had taken as booty 15 years previously.\n[4]\nWhile resident there, the letter Muhammad had sent, perhaps a year earlier,\ncame to his hand.  When he read it, he enquired about the presence of someone\nfrom the author’s people in the territory he controlled, and was told of Abu\nSufyan’s trade caravan from Mecca, which was trading nearby.  He, with his\ncompanions, was summoned to the Emperor’s court in Jerusalem, appearing before\nHeraclius who had his Byzantine Grandees around him.\nThe Questions Posed by Heraclius and Their Answers\nHeraclius called for his interpreter so as to\nquestion them, commanding him to ask who amongst them was the closest in\nkinship to the man who claimed to be a prophet.\nAbu Sufyan replied, “I am the nearest\nrelative to him (in this group).”\nHeraclius asked, “And what is the\nrelationship between you and him?”\nAbu Sufyan said, “He is my (distant) cousin\non the spear side.”\n[5]\nHeraclius said, “Bring him closer!”  and\nhad Abu Sufyan’s companions placed behind him, at his shoulders.  Then he\nordered his interpreter, “Tell his companions that I am going to question him\nabout the man who claims to be a prophet, so if he tells a lie, immediately\nrepudiate it as a lie.”\n“How is the lineage of this man among you?”\nthe Roman Emperor continued.\n“He is of noble descent.”  Abu Sufyan\nreplied.\nHeraclius further enquired, “Has anybody amongst\nyou ever previously claimed the same as he does?” “Was\nhe prone to lying before he claimed what he has claimed?”  “Was anybody among\nhis ancestors a king?”\nTo each question Abu Sufyan could only answer, “No.”\n“Do the highborn or the humble among his\npeople listen to him?”\nAbu Sufyan replied, “The powerless, rather\nthan the highborn, follow him.”\nHe said, “Are they increasing or decreasing\nin number?”\n“They are increasing,” was the reply.\nHe then asked, “Does anybody amongst those\nwho embrace his religion turn away discontent and renounce it after a while.”\n“No.”\nHeraclius said, “Does he break his\ncovenants\n?\n”\nThe\ncaravan leader replied,\n“No.  We have a truce with him now, but we fear\nhe may betray us.”\nThe\nquestioning relentlessly continued\n: “Have you ever fought each other?”\n“Yes.”\n“How do the battles turn out?”\n“Sometimes he wins the battles and\nsometimes we win them.”\n“What does he order you to do (when he\npreaches)?\n“He tells us to worship God alone and not\nto worship anything along with Him, and to renounce the all the idols that our\nancestors have taught us to worship.  He orders us to pray, give charity, be\nchaste, fulfill promises and discharge our trusts to kith and kin.”\nAbu Sufyan was to later admit that he would have\nlied about the Prophet if he hadn’t been afraid of the shame of having his\ncolleagues (listening behind him) spread reports that he was a liar.  So he\nanswered as truthfully as he could.  He also mentioned the part that he had\nfeared betrayal from Muhammad and those he led because it presented the best\nopportunity he had to slip in a negative statement against him.\nThe Emperor Assesses the Interrogation\nAfter he had finished interrogating Abu Sufyan\nabout the Prophet, Heraclius decided to tell him what he had learned from the\ninterview.  His interpreter conveyed his analysis.\nHe said:  “I asked you about his lineage\namong you, and you stated that he was of sound lineage.  Indeed, all the\nMessengers of God come from sound lineages among their respective peoples.\n“Then I asked if anybody had claimed what\nhe claims before him among your tribe, and your reply was that none had.  If\nyou had said others had made such a claim, I would have assumed he was\nfollowing that which had been said before him.\n“I further asked if you had found him a\nliar before he said what he said, and you said that you had not.  I know that a\nperson who does not lie about other men would never lie about God.\n“And I asked you if any of his ancestors\nhad been a king.  If your reply had been an affirmative, I would have thought\nthat the man was seeking to restore his ancestral kingdom.\n“Then I enquired whether the highborn or\nthe humble followed him, and you told me his followers were mainly humble\npeople.  Indeed, they are invariably the followers of Messengers.\n“Then I asked you whether his followers\nwere increasing or decreasing, and you informed me that they were increasing.  And\nso it is with true faith until it is complete.\n“I further asked you whether there was\nanybody who embraces the religion he teaches who turns away discontent and\nrenounces it after a while.  Your reply was in the negative, which is how true\nfaith is, when the delight of it mixes completely with their hearts.\n“And I asked you whether you fought one\nanother, to which you replied affirmatively, adding that the fortunes of war\nwere sometimes in his favor and sometimes in yours.  So it is with all\nMessengers, but the final victory will be with him.\n“I asked you whether he is ever\ntreacherous, and you said he is not.  So it is with all the Messengers; they\nnever act treacherously.\n“Then I asked you what he enjoins upon you\nin the religion he preaches.  You stated that he orders you to worship God\nalone, and not associate any thing with Him, and not worship the idols of your\nancestors.  And that he enjoins you to pray and give charity, to be chaste,\nfulfill covenants and discharge trusts.  And this is the description of what a\nprophet does.”\nThus did The Byzantine Caesar acknowledge the\nprophethood of the Messenger of God.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nGhassan was vassal state of the Roman Empire in Greater Syria\nadministered by an Arab king loyal to Byzantium.\n[2]\nThis aspect of the story will be continued in the next\narticle.\n[3]\nThe stories in this article are as related by Abdullah\nibn Abbas in Saheeh Bukhari\n[4]\nKhosrau II, a

    "content": "The Public Reading of the Letter\nAfter Heraclius had confirmed that he believed Muhammad\nto be a prophet, he said:\n“I knew that he was going to appear, but I\ndid not know that he would be from among you.  If what you have said is true,\nhe will rule the very the ground beneath my feet; if I knew I would definitely see\nhim in person, I would undertake the journey to meet him; and if I were with\nhim, I would wash his feet.”\nThis is in keeping with the placement of this\nstory after the ibn al-Natur’s report of the attempt by Heraclius to foretell\nthe future astrologically.  It is apparent that he ‘knew’, or at least suspected,\nthat a powerful prophet had arisen among the Arab people.  It was at this stage\nthat he asked for the letter he had received from the Messenger of God so as to\nread it aloud to the assembly.\n“When Heraclius had finished his speech and\nhad read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court, so the\nMeccans were ejected.  Abu Sufyan wondered aloud to his companions, “The\naffairs of ibn abi-Kabsha\n[1]\nhave become so prominent that even the King of the Bani-Asfar (the fair\nskinned ones) fears him.”\nAbu Sufyan later told the narrator\n[2]\n“I lay low, by God, and reserved, certain that the affairs of Muhammad would\nemerge triumphant, until God brought my heart to the point of embracing Islam.”\nHeraclius in Homs\nMeanwhile, according to ibn al-Natur’s\nnarration, Heraclius had written a letter to a friend in Rome concerning the\nletter he had received\n[3]\nwhose\nknowledge he trusted as comparable to his own.  Then he left Jerusalem\n[4]\nfor Homs (\nEmesa\nin Roman times) in Syria, where he awaited the reply.\n“When he received the reply from his friend,\nhe saw that the man agreed that the signs portended the appearance of a new\nleader, and that the leader was the expected prophet.  On that, Heraclius\ninvited all the Grandees of Byzantium to assemble in his palace at Homs.\n“When his Grandees had assembled, he\nordered that all the doors of his palace be closed.  Then he came out and said,\n“O Byzantines!  If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and\nwant your Empire to remain, then give a pledge of allegiance to the emerging\nProphet!\n“On hearing this invitation, the Grandees of\nthe Church ran towards the gates of the palace like a herd of wild asses, but\nfound the doors closed.  Heraclius, realizing their hatred towards Islam, lost\nhope that they would ever embrace Islam, and he ordered that they should be\nbrought back to the audience room.  After they returned, he said, “What I have\njust said was simply to test the strength of your conviction, and I have seen\nit.\n“The people prostrated before him and\nbecame pleased with him, and Heraclius turned away from faith.”\nA legend has grown up around the\nevents at Homs.  It is said that Heraclius first suggested that his bishops\nembrace Islam, but when they refused, he suggested that the Empire pay tribute\nto the Prophet of Islam.  When they refused this in turn, he suggested making\npeace with the Muslims and agreeing to a pact of non-belligerence.  When this\ntoo was refused, he left Syria for Byzantium, and gave up all interest in\npreserving the Empire south and east of Antioch – never taking the field\nagainst the Muslim advance in person, and sending incompetent generals as the\ndefenders of his Middle Eastern lands.  What is certain is that he treated the\nletter and the claim to prophethood therein seriously, and he made every effort\nto sway his people before turning back.\nThe Heirloom\nThe historian, al-Suhayli was the source of two\nmore stories associated with the letter to Heraclius, both of which ibn Hajar\nincluded in the commentary on the stories above.\n[5]\nHe commented that al-Suhayli recalled hearing of a letter that was kept in a\njeweled diamond case, which showed the high status of its owner, that had been\nleft as an heirloom even until that day, and had reached the hands of the King\nof Franja.\n[6]\nHis\ndescendants thought that it had come into his possession at the time of the\nconquest of Toledo,\n[7]\nand\nthe Commander of the Muslim Army, Abdul Malik ibn Saad came to know of it\nthrough one of these descendants\n[8]\nin\nthe 12\nth\nCentury.  Some of Abdul Malik’s companions related that the\nCommander of the Muslim Army sat with the King of Franja\n[9]\n,\nwho took out the letter in its jeweled case.  When Abdul Malik saw the\ntreasured scroll he realized it was very ancient, and asked if he could kiss\nthe venerable antiquity.  However, the King of Franja refused to let him.\nAl Suhayli further said that he had been told by\nmore than one source that the jurist, Nuraddin ibn Saygh al-Dimashqi said that\nhe had heard that Sayfuddin Flih al-Mansuri was sent with a gift by King\nal-Mansur Qalaun\n[10]\nto\nthe King of Morocco,\n[11]\nwho\nthen sent the gift to the King of Franja\n[12]\nin exchange for an unmentioned favor, which was granted.  The King of Franja\ninvited the messenger to stay in his Kingdom for a while, but he turned the\noffer down.  Before he left, however, the King asked Sayfuddin if he would like\nto see a valuable object which may have been of interest to him (as a Muslim). \nThen he had a chest brought out full of compartments, each compartment filled\nwith treasures.\nFrom one of the compartments he took out a long,\nthin diamond encrusted box (rather like a pencil case).  He opened it and took\nout a scroll.  The ancient paper of the scroll was damaged and the writing on\nit somewhat faded, but most of the body had been preserved by dint of\nsandwiching it between two silk cloths when rolling it for storage.  The King\nof Franja said: “This is the letter that my ancestor, Caesar, received from\nyour Prophet, which has been handed down to me as an heirloom.  Our ancestor\nleft behind a will that his descendents should keep this heirloom if they\nwished their rule of the Kingdom to last.  With it we are strongly protected as\nlong as we respect the letter and keep it hidden.  So has the Kingdom come down\nto us.”\n[13]\nExactly how valid the claim that the Kingdom of\nHeraclius (who had officially been Caesar of the entire Roman Empire) had\ndescended to him is questionable, as the Byzantine Empire still existed in the\neast, and would continue for a further 150 years.  However, Heraclius could\nhave sent the letter to Rome, as mentioned earlier, and the letter could have\nbeen kept there and passed down into the Visigoth line of Emperors when\nCharlemagne was crowned Emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in 800CE.\nWe cannot categorically say that\nthe letter actually did survive the centuries, though these stories point to\nthat possibility.  One of the Prophet’s letters still exists on its original\nparchment in Topkapi museum.\nConclusion\nMany may think that Heraclius secretly became\nMuslim, for he sought to establish whether Muhammad’s prophetic claim was true\nby considering his background, motivations, and effects on his people; his\ncharacter, accomplishments and message.  Judging from his reply to Abu Sufyan\nand the invitation to his pillars of society in Homs, he seems to have been\nconvinced that Muhammad was genuine.  Perhaps his heart was swayed towards the\nmonotheism expressed by Muhammad in his letter, and he certainly tried to\nfollow his advice to avoid the sin of misguiding those he ruled.  His subjects,\nhowever, proved too strong in their rejection, and he capitulated to their\npressure, unable to submit to this new faith because he feared the rebellion of\nthe people.  For this reason, like the uncle of the Prophet, Abu Talib, who\nbelieved that Muhammad was a prophet and guarded him throughout his latter life\nuntil death but still did not submit to Islam due to the shame brought on by\nhis peers, Heraclius died as a disbeliever in Islam and the Prophet of God..\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe Prophet Muh\na\nmmad,\nmay the mercy and blessings of God be upon him.\n[2]\nIbn Abbas.\n[3]\nIt is possible he sent the actual letter from the\nProphet with his request to assess it, though this is not made explicit in the\nnarration.\n[4]\nIt is historically recorded that he in March 630CE\nrestored the cross the Nestorians had removed from the Church of the Holy\nSepulcher, which was several months after his meeting with Abu Sufyan.  He\nwould have left for Homs soon after that.\n[5]\nFat-hal-Bari\nby Ibn Hajar al-Askalani.\n[6]\n‘Franja’ is the Spanish word used for the coastal kingdom(s) of the Iberian Peninsula. In this story the Kings of Franja are from the Jiminez and Burgundy dynasties of Asturias, Galicia, Leon and Castile (which split off from Leon). Leon came into existence when the Kingdom of Asturias was split three ways in 910.\nSee (\nhttp://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/regents/iberian/leon.htm\n).\n[7]\nBy\nAlfonso VI 1085CE, or 478H.\n[8]\nThe\nKings of Leon from the House of Burgundy\n[9]\nThough not named, this would probably have been Alfonso VII ‘The Emperor’ or\nFerdinand II of Castile and Leon.\n[10]\nPossibly the Egyptian King from the Mamluk Dynasty, who ruled Egypt from 1278-90CE.\n[11]\nVery probably Abu Yusuf Yaqub from the Merinid Dynasty, who\nreigned from 1259-86CE.\n[12]\nMost likely\n, Alfonso X, King of Castile and\nLeon (1252-84CE)\n.  He had the title Rex Romanorum (the King of Rome –\nSee\n:\nhttp://www.masterliness.com/s/Rex.Romanorum.htm\n),\nto which he was elected, as his family was one who could claim descent from\nCharlemagne.\nSee\n: (\nhttp://www.masterliness.com/a/Alfonso.X.of.Castile.htm\n).\n[13]\nAlfonso VII, his forefather, had been known as ‘The Emperor’ because\ntraditionally the Kings of Leon and Asturias, being descendents of the Visigoth\nHoly Roman Empire, were known as pretenders to the Empire of Iberia.",

    "content": "This was a difficult time in the life of Prophet Muhammad,\nand this journey was a great compliment to him.  The deliverance of the message\nwas entering a new phase, and the establishment of the Muslim nation was about\nto begin.  Prophet Muhammad was feeling overwhelmed and alone.  The vast\nmajority of Meccans had refused to heed his call or accept his message.  Both\nhis beloved uncle and cherished wife had died, and this gift of God offered him\nsupport and opened his eyes to the signs and wonders of the universe.  After\ntravelling the enormous distance to Jerusalem on the back of al-Buraq, Prophet\nMuhammad reached the area known as Masjid al-Aqsa. He dismounted and tethered al-Buraq\nto a ring in the gate.\nAnother Miracle Occurs\nProphet Muhammad walked into the Masjid – the place of\nprostration - to be met by a group of the previous Prophets; he then had the\ngreat honour of leading them in prayer.  God rewarded His Messenger and caused\nhim to understand that the Prophets before him also went through difficult\ntimes preaching to their people.  They stood behind Prophet Muhammad and\nacknowledged him as their leader.  This was another indication of his importance\nand excellence as well as the nature of his message.\nBefore the advent of Prophet Muhammad, all the Prophets delivered\ntheir message of submission to One God to their own people; Muhammad, however,\nhad come for all of mankind.  God refers to him as a mercy.  God says in Quran:\n“He listens to what is best for you; he believes in God; has\nfaith in the believers; and is a mercy to those of you who believe.” (Quran\n9:61)\nThe message was international, and this communication distributed\nworldwide was Islam.  The Prophets of God stood behind the newest and final\nMessenger of God and supported him when his need was greatest.  Prophet\nMuhammad mentions in his sayings that all of the Prophets are brothers.\n[1]\nThis congregation\nstanding behind Prophet Muhammad was a sign of real and everlasting brotherhood.\nThe Significance of Al-Aqsa\nThe fact that this momentous occasion took place in Jerusalem is also of significance.  This is the land of the Prophets of God; this is the land of Abraham, Isaac, Moses and Jesus. God was forging a link between his Holy House in Mecca and Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.  God was also linking the so-called\ncradle of\nreligion,\nthe Holy Land around Jerusalem, with the land of Arabia, the birthplace of the religion designed by the Creator, for all of humanity - Islam.\nGod established Al-Aqsa as one of the three Holy Masjids\nin Islam.  The Holy Masjid in Mecca, the Prophet Muhammad’s Masjid, yet to be\nestablished in Medina, and this Masjid in this blessed neighbourhood of Jerusalem.  It is only to these three Masjids to which Muslims can travel for the purpose\nof worship.\n[2]\nOne prayer in Masjid Al-Aqsa is worth 250 prayers elsewhere, excluding the\nProphet’s Masjid where one prayer is the equivalent of 1,000 prayers and the Holy\nMasjid in Mecca where one prayer contains the reward of 100,000 prayers.\n[3]\nGod emphasized the\nsignificance and sacredness of Masjid Al-Aqsa, and for this reason it plays an\nimportant role in a Muslim’s life.   Therefore it is guarded and protected\nzealously.\nAl-Aqsa was the first\nqiblah\n(the direction in\nwhich a Muslim turns to pray) in Islam, but this direction was later changed to\nHoly Masjid in Mecca.  Establishing the exact date for this change is\ndifficult, but from the evidence, we can discover approximately when this\noccurred because the mission of Prophet Muhammad is divided into two distinct\nperiods.  The Meccan period, defined by calling the people to the religion of\nIslam, and the Medinan period, defined by the establishment of the Muslim\nstate.  Prophet Muhammad and the majority of his followers migrated to the city\nof Medina in the 14\nth\nyear of Prophethood.\nThe Night Journey and Ascension took place late in the Meccan\nperiod, while the\nqiblah\nchanged to Mecca around 15 months after the\nProphet’s migration to Medina.  From this, we can infer that the Muslims faced Al-Aqsa\nwhen praying for approximately three years before God changed the direction to Mecca.  This by no means diminished the significance of Jerusalem or Masjid Al-Aqsa, it\nmerely represented another step in the establishment of the message for all of\nhumanity.  The Holy Masjid in Mecca was fixed as the central point in Islam.\nThe Journey and Miracle Continues\nWhile still in the sacred precincts of Masjid Al-Aqsa,\nthe Angel Gabriel presented Prophet Muhammad with two cups.  One was filled\nwith milk, the other with wine, and both offered to the Prophet.  Prophet\nMuhammad chose and drank the milk.  Angel Gabriel then said to him “Thanks be to\nGod, who guided you to the\nfitrah\n;if you had taken the wine,\nyour followers would have gone astray”.\n[4]\nIt is difficult to translate the Arabic word\nfitrah\ninto English; it\ndenotes the natural and pure state in which one is born, an innate feeling that\nguides one to do the “right” thing.  Prophet Muhammad instinctively chose right\nover wrong, good over evil, and the Straight Path rather than the crooked path\nto Hell.\nIt was from the Holy city of Jerusalem, in the sacred\nprecincts of Masjid Al-Aqsa\n[5]\nthat Prophet Muhammad commenced the next stage of his miraculous Night Journey.\n Prophet Muhammad ascended to the lowest heaven from a rock.  This rock can be\nfound inside the Dome of the Rock, the most famous symbol of Jerusalem.  It\nshould not be confused with the actual Masjid building, which is on the other\nside of the Al-Aqsa compound.  The entire precinct is the masjid, but many\nseparate buildings exist there.  It is important to remember that although the\nDome of the Rock is inside the Masjid compound, it is not Masjid Al-Aqsa and it\nis not the place of prostration where Prophet Muhammad led the previous\nProphets in prayer.  From the rock, now covered by the familiar golden dome,\nProphet Muhammad ascended to the lowest heaven in the company of Angel Gabriel.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[2]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari and Muslim\n[3]\nSaheeh al-Hakim\n[4]\nSaheeh Bukhari\n[5]\nThe compound is also known as “Temple Mount” in the West, after the temple that Solomon built there.",

    "content": "The Night Journey and the Ascension was a great blessing\nbestowed upon Muhammad, the Prophet of God.  It was a journey beginning at the Holy\nMasjid in Mecca, then moving overland to Masjid al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and finally\ncontinuing up through the seven heavens into the presence of God, the Almighty.\n As we travel up through the seven heavens with Prophet Muhammad, it is\nimportant to remember that the places he visits are not part of Paradise.\nIn the English language, we generally use the word\nheaven\nto mean the spiritual plane of eternal happiness, the reward for a righteous\nlife and the opposite of hell, the place of eternal punishment.  However, this\nwas not always the case; the word heaven comes from the Old English word\nheofon,\n[1]\nused to denote the\nsky, which is the area above the earth where the celestial bodies are.  Eventually,\nheaven\nlost its original meaning and came to imply Paradise.  In Arabic, however,\nthere have always been two separate words used,\nsama\nand\njennah\n. \nThe word\nsama\nis used for the skies above us, and they are part of the\ntemporary world which will be destroyed on the Day of Judgement.  The word\njennah\n,\nhowever, denotes Paradise, the land of eternal bliss, the permanent home of the\nrighteous believers, and the opposite of Hell.\n“Then He completed and finished from their creation as seven\nheavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair.  And We adorned the\nnearest heaven with light sources to be an adornment, as well as to guard.  Such\nis the Decree of Him the All-Mighty, the All-Knower.” (Quran 41:12)\n“Their Lord gives them glad tidings of a Mercy from Him, and\nthat He is pleased, and of Gardens (\njennah\n) for them wherein are\neverlasting delights.  They will dwell therein forever.  Verily, with God is a\ngreat reward.” (Quran 9:21-22)\nThe Wonders of God\nProphet Muhammad ascended into the heavens from the rock\nnow housed in the familiar golden dome that has become the symbol for Jerusalem.  This is a journey that no other human had ever made or has made since.  It\ndemonstrates God’s ability to bring the seemingly impossible into being.  Here,\nthe concepts of time and space as we know them do not apply, and it is beyond our\nhuman capabilities to understand the true omnipotence of God.  In his sayings\nand traditions, Prophet Muhammad described the size of the heavens; the first\nheaven, as compared to the second, is similar to a small ring in the desert, and\nhe continued this narrative until he described the sixth heaven as being the size\nof a ring in the desert compared to the seventh heaven.  The magnitude of this\nis unimaginable.  Our earth, and what we call the universe, is contained within\nthe first heaven.  Even with the scientific knowledge of the 21\nst\ncentury, we have no idea how big this is, how far the universe extends, or what\nwonders it contains.\nProphet Muhammad travelled with the Angel Gabriel up\ninto the heights of the heavens.  Together they came to the gate of the first\nheaven, where Angel Gabriel sought permission to enter.  The gatekeepers asked,\n“Who is it?”  to which Gabriel replied, “It is I, Gabriel”.  The gatekeepers\nthen asked who was accompanying him; when they were told it was Muhammad, they\nasked if he had been given his mission to guide all of mankind to the worship\nof One God.  Angel Gabriel answered in the affirmative, so the angels welcomed Prophet\nMuhammad, called his arrival a pleasure, and opened the gate.\nGreeting the Prophets\nProphet Muhammad tells us that he saw his father Adam,\nthe father of all of mankind.  He greeted him with the greeting of all Muslims,\n-\nAssalamu alaikum\n(may peace be upon you).  Adam returned the greeting\nand expressed his faith in Muhammad’s prophethood.  He called him his pure son,\nthe pure prophet.  Imagine the pleasure that this meeting must have given to\nboth men.  After thousands of years, Adam was able to see his son Muhammad, the\ngreatest of his descendents.  Muhammad was able to look into the eyes of the\nfather of mankind.  The wonders however were only just beginning.  Angel Gabriel\nand Prophet Muhammad then ascended to the second heaven.\nAt the gate, Angel Gabriel again sought permission to\nenter.  When the gatekeepers learned Prophet Muhammad had been given his\nmission and was trying to enter, they welcomed him and opened the gate.  There\nProphet Muhammad saw the two cousins, Prophet John (known in Christian\ntraditions as\nthe Baptist\n) and the Messenger of God, Prophet Jesus;  Prophet\nMuhammad exchanged greetings with them.\nProphet Muhammad and Angel Gabriel ascended once more to\nthe gates of the third heaven.  At each gate, the same exchange took place. \nWhen the gatekeepers had established that it was Angel Gabriel in the company\nof Prophet Muhammad, who had indeed been given his mission, they gave\npermission to enter.  Here, in the third heaven, Prophet Muhammad met Joseph\nand described him as an embodiment of half of all beauty.\nAs Prophet Muhammad met the Prophets in each heaven, he\nexchanged greetings with them, and this was always\nAssalamu alaikum,\nthe\ngreeting of peace used by all those in submission to the One True God.  In the\nfourth heaven, Prophet Muhammad met Prophet Idris, whom God described in Quran\n(19:57)\nas being elevated to a very high level.  In the fifth heaven, he met Prophet Aaron,\nthe brother of Moses.  At each meeting, the Prophets expressed their faith in\nMuhammad’s prophethood.  In the sixth heaven, Prophet Muhammad met Moses.\nWhenever Prophet Moses is mentioned in the Quran or in\nthe narrations of Prophet Muhammad, we know that something important is about\nto be described.  After the two Prophets had exchanged greetings and Prophet\nMoses had expressed his faith in Muhammad’s prophethood, Moses started to weep. \nWhen he was asked why, he replied: “A young man has come after me, and more of\nhis followers will enter paradise then my followers”.\nUntil the advent of Islam, Prophet Moses had had the\nlargest following of any Prophet.  Moses cried, and from this, we can\nunderstand that there was a type of rivalry between the Prophets; but it was\nnot a competition filled with jealousy or envy. Rather, it was filled with\ncompassion.  As we move further into the journey, we will see the love and\ncompassion Prophet Moses had for Muhammad and his followers.  Prophet Muhammad\nand Angel Gabriel then ascended into the seventh heaven.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nWebster’s Online dictionary.",

    "content": "The Angel Gabriel and Prophet Muhammad continued their\nmiraculous ascension through the heavens.  This journey was far beyond the\nwildest imagining of any human being.  It began in the deserts of Arabia and spanned the reaches of the known universe and beyond.  At the gate of the seventh\nheaven, they exchanged the same questions and answers as in the previous\nheavens, and the angels declared their pleasure at meeting Prophet Muhammad.  Permission\nto enter was given and the Prophet of God, accompanied by Gabriel, the angel\ntrusted with the revelations of God, moved into the final heaven.\nThe seventh heaven is an expression used by Christians\nto denote extreme happiness or bliss, as in “I am in the seventh heaven”.  In Islam,\nthe seventh heaven is where Prophet Mohammad met Prophet Abraham; and indeed,\nhe (Muhammad) must have been extremely happy and in a state of bliss, having\nbeen honoured with this journey of wonders.  Both Prophets exchanged greetings\nby saying\nAssalamu alaikum\n(may peace be upon you) and, as every other\nprophet had done, Prophet Abraham expressed his belief and faith in Prophet\nMuhammad’s mission.\nThrough his son, Ishmael, Abraham is the father of the\nArabs and the ancestor of Prophet Muhammad; he is an ancestor of the people who\nbecame the Children of Israel (followers of Prophet Moses) through his son\nIsaac.  In Jewish traditions, Abraham is called the father of the Jews.  However,\nIslam rejects this idea, for the Quran clearly states that he was neither a Jew\nnor a Christian, but a believer in pure monotheism (belief in One God).\n“Why do you dispute about Abraham, while the Torah and the\nGospel were not revealed until after him?  Have you then no sense?  Abraham was\nneither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true\nMuslim Hanifa.\n”\n[1]\n(Quran 3:65\n& 67)\nMuslims are required to believe in all of the Prophets\nof God; Abraham, however, holds a special place as one of the important\nmessengers of God and has the unique honour of being called, in both Islamic\nand Christian\n[2]\ntraditions, the beloved servant of God.  Together, Abraham and his son Ishmael\nbuilt the Kaaba (the black cubical building in the middle of the Holy Masjid in\n  Mecca).\n“And remember when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the\nfoundations of the House, saying, Our Lord!  Accept this from us.  Verily!  You\nare the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.” (Quran 2:127)\nMuslims turn their faces towards the Kaba many times\nevery day whilst performing their prayers, and in every prayer, they ask God to\nbless Abraham and his family.\nThe World of Angels\nWhile in the seventh heaven, Prophet Muhammad was shown\nthe building known as the much-frequented house, or\nal Bayt al-Mamoor\nin\nArabic.  It is fitting that Prophet Abraham was here with this house, as it is\nthe heavenly equivalent of the Kaaba in Mecca.  Each year at the time of\npilgrimage (Hajj), more than 2 million Muslims from all over the world flock to\n  Mecca to follow in the footsteps of Prophet Abraham and perform certain rites\nincluding circling the Kaaba.  Every day 70,000 angels visit this much-frequented\nhouse in the seventh heaven to worship God.  Prophet Muhammad informed us that,\nonce the angels have visited\nBayt al-Mamoor,\nthey never return.  God\nswears by this house in the Quran.\n“And by the\nBayt al-Mamoor\n.” (Quran 52:4)\nSeventy thousand angels every day!  What are the\nimplications of this?  Think about it and wonder for how many thousands or even\nmillions of years has this been happening?  How many of these beings, created\nby God from light, are there?  This was another wonder that Prophet Muhammad\nwas privileged to see and made able to describe to us.  In his traditions, he\nalso informs us that the heavens above us are moaning, every space as big as\nthe width of four fingers is occupied by an angel worshipping God.\nThe Uppermost Boundary\nProphet Muhammad then moved through the seventh heaven\nto the uppermost boundary, to\nSidrat al-Muntaha\n, a lote tree.\n“Near\nSidrat al-Muntaha\n(lote-tree of the utmost\nboundary.  Near it is the Paradise of Abode.” (Quran 53:14-15)\nHe described its fruits like jugs and its leaves as big\nas elephant ears.  Four rivers originated from the lote tree’s roots.  When he\nasked about them, Prophet Muhammad was told that two of the rivers originated\nin Paradise.  Nothing has reached us about the names or significance of these\ntwo rivers from the narrative of the ascension.  However, he was told that the\nother two rivers were replicas of the Nile and the Euphrates, two rivers that are\nespecially blessed in this world of mankind.\nSidrat al-Muntaha\nis called the uttermost boundary\nbecause everything that comes up from the earth or the heavens stops there, and\neverything that comes down stops there,\n[3]\nand because the knowledge of the angels stops at that point.  No one\nhas gone beyond it except Prophet Muhammad.\n[4]\nBeyond this point, we leave the heavens and move into the realm of the\nhereafter, the realm that contains Paradise and the Throne of God.  As Prophet\nMuhammad continues his miraculous journey, he moves into this realm and stands\nin the presence of God Almighty.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe word\nMuslim\ndenotes a man who submits to God alone, whilst\nHanifa\nconnotes purity, truth and sincerity.  The Arabic dictionary assigns the\nword\northodox\nas one of the denotations of\nHanifa\n, but it is more\nthan orthodoxy.  It is n untaught orthodoxy; a sense of the true nature of\nthings that is instinctual and natural.\n[2]\nIsaiah 41:8 & 2.\n[3]\nSaheeh Muslim\n[4]\nImam Al-Nawawi",

    "content": "Beyond the lote tree, the upmost boundary is a place\nwhere, apart from one exception, no human has ever been.  The night journey and\nascension through the heavens culminated in Prophet Muhammad moving past the\nupmost boundary and standing in the presence of Almighty God.  Beyond the lote\ntree is the realm of the hereafter, Paradise, and the throne of God and God\nhimself.\nThe word miraculous does not go far enough in describing\nwhat a wonder this must have been for Prophet Muhammad.  It is beyond\ndescription and beyond imagining. However, the Prophet Muhammad did not see God\nwith his eyes, as God tells us in the Quran\n“No vision can grasp Him.” (Quran 6:103)\nOne of the companions asked Prophet Muhammad directly if\nhe saw God, to which he answered,\n“He is veiled by light, how could I see him.” (\nSaheeh\nMuslim\n)\nThe fact remains however, that Muhammad Prophet of God,\nstood in the presence of God.\nThe Importance of Prayer\nGod spoke to Prophet Muhammad and we have no details of\nthe exchange except that God enjoined the daily prayers upon Prophet Muhammad\nand his followers.  From this, we immediately understand the importance of\nprayer.  It is the only command which God ordained in the heavens; all other\ndecrees originated on earth.  Prayer is a gift from God to those who truly believe\nin His Oneness.  God bestowed this gift upon Prophet Muhammad who in turn gave\nit to the followers of Islam.  It is a gift full of great blessings and\nbounties.  It establishes and maintains our connection to God.  God has no need\nof our prayers but we, as helpless human beings, are in great need of feeling\nconnected to Him.  In fact, the Arabic word for the five daily prayers is\nsalah,\nwhich come from the root word meaning “connection”.\n“Guard strictly five obligatory prayers especially the middle\nprayer ­.  And stand before God with obedience.” (Quran 2:238)\nGod enjoined 50 prayers on Prophet Muhammad and his\nfollowers.  As Prophet Muhammad was descending he passed by Prophet Moses who requested\nto know what had been enjoined.  When Prophet Muhammad explained that he had\nbeen ordered to prayer 50 times per day, Moses felt astonished and immediately\nsaid, “Go back to your Lord and ask for a reduction”.  When God prescribed 50\nprayers, Prophet Muhammad accepted it, Moses, having had been a great prophet\nhimself, knew what from his followers what people could and could not handle in\nregards to religious obligations. He was sure that the followers of Muhammad\nwould not be able to perform that many prayers.  Prophet Muhammad had knowledge.\nbut Prophet Moses at this time had more experience.\nProphet Muhammad accepted the advice of his older\nbrother/prophet, went back into the presence of God, and asked for a reduction. \nGod reduced them by ten to forty prayers.  Prophet Muhammad descended again;\nProphet Moses asked him what happened.  When he heard that the reduction was only\nten, Prophet Moses sent him back to ask again for a further reduction.\nThis exchange continued until the number of obligatory\nprayers became five.  Prophet Moses suggested a further reduction saying,\n“O\nMuhammad, I know people, your nation will not be able to handle it, go back and\nask for the burden on your people to be relieved.”\nProphet Muhammad answered\n“No.”  He felt ashamed to ask for another reduction and said he was satisfied with\nfive daily prayers.  A voice rang out, saying, “The prayers have been reduced\nto five but they will be rewarded as though they were fifty.”  God makes it\nclear to us that even praying these five prayers can be difficult for some\npeople, but that those who establish the connection and trust that they will\none day meet their Lord will find it easy.\n“And seek help in patience and the prayer: and truly it is\nextremely heavy and hard except for the true believers in God. Those who obey God\nwith full submission, fear much from His Punishment, and believe in His Promise\n(Paradise, etc.) and in His Warnings (Hell, etc.).  (They are those) who are\ncertain that they are going to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are\ngoing to return.” (Quran 2:45–46)\nMercy, Love and Compassion\nThis miraculous night concluded with this sign of the\nmercy of God.  Imagine how hard it would be to pray 50 times a day.  Although\nwe learned during this journey that Moses cried when he realised Prophet Muhammad\nwould have more followers then he on the Day of Judgement, we also learn how eager\nProphet Moses was to give advice to Prophet Muhammad, and how keen he was to\nmake the practice of Islam easy upon the believers.  The competition between\nthe Prophets was one of love and compassion, and from this we should learn how\nto treat each other.  Although God tells us to compete with one another in\ndoing deeds of righteousness, we should encourage and enable one another to do\nthis easily.\n“...so strive as in a race in good deeds.  The return of you\n(all) is to God; then He will inform you about that in which you used to\ndiffer.” (Quran 5:48)\nProphet Muhammad then descended back to the Holy Mosque in\n  Mecca.  The companions of the Prophet were now about to face the biggest test\nto their faith so far.  Muhammad, the Prophet of God, was about to reveal that\nhe had returned from an overnight journey to the farthest Masjid in Jerusalem, a journey that normally took more than one month.  He was also about to say he\nhad travelled where no man had gone before, through the heavens and into the\npresence of God.  This was a miraculous journey by night, but would his\ncompanions believe him and how would his enemies react?",

    "content": "Prophet Muhammad travelled on the back of Al-Buraq all\nthe way to the farthest Mosque in Jerusalem.  He ascended through the seven\nheavens and marvelled at wonders unimaginable.  He looked into the faces and\nexchanged greetings with many of his fellow Prophets, and the final slave and\nMessenger of God, Muhammad, stood in the presence of God Himself.  On the same\nnight, only several hours after he had commenced his journey, Prophet Muhammad returned\nto Mecca.\nThis miraculous journey was about to become a weapon\nagainst Prophet Muhammad and his followers by his enemies, and equally it would\nbe an extreme test of faith for the believers.  Upon his homecoming, Prophet\nMuhammad made his way to Umm Ayman and told her of his miraculous journey.  She\nresponded, “O Messenger of God, do not tell anyone about this.”  Umm Ayman had\nperfect faith in Prophet Muhammad and believed his account of the journey, but\nshe was afraid of how others would respond.\nProphet Muhammad described Umm Ayman as “my mother after\nmy own mother”.  She was the faithful servant of his mother Aminah and remained\nwith Prophet Muhammad through the deaths of his mother and grandfather.  Prophet\nMuhammad and Umm Ayman had always been very close, and at the completion of\nthis wondrous journey, he went to Umm Ayman’s home, perhaps for comfort and\nease while he contemplated this miracle, and decided his next move.\nProphet Muhammad responded by saying that he would tell\nthe people about the wondrous night.  He considered it his responsibility\nbefore God to convey the message, no matter the response or consequences; God\nwas responsible for the outcome.  He left the house quietly with sombre\ncontemplation, and made his way to the Holy Mosque.  He met people along the\nway, and slowly the news of the night journey spread amongst the people.\nThe Response\nWhile\nProphet Mohammad was sitting silently in the Mosque, Abu Jahl approached him\nand asked casually, “O Muhammad is there anything new?”  Known as one of the\ngreatest enemies of Islam Abu Jahl was responsible for the torture, punishment,\nmurder and harassment of the new Muslims throughout the early days of Islam.  Even\nthough he was aware of the animosity and hatred  Abu Jahl felt towards him,\nProphet Muhammad answered truthfully and said, “This past night I have\ntravelled to Jerusalem and back.”\nAbu\nJahl, being unable to contain his amusement, responded by requesting Muhammad to\nrepeat these words in front of the people of Mecca.  Prophet Muhammad responded\nin the affirmative, and Abu Jahl left the Mosque running, calling out to the\npeople as he ran through the streets.  When sufficient people had gathered in\nthe Mosque, at Abu Jahl’s request Prophet Muhammad said, for all to hear, “I\nhave been to Jerusalem and back.”\nThe\ncrowd of people started to laugh, whistle, and clap.  They treated it as a big\njoke and fell against one another laughing.  This was the response expected by\nAbu Jahl and he was thrilled.  The disbelievers in the crowd saw a chance to put\nan end to Islam.  They ridiculed and belittled Prophet Muhammad’s claim.  Among\nthe crowd were people who had travelled to Jerusalem and they asked Prophet\nMuhammad to describe what he had seen.\nThe\nProphet of God began to describe his journey but he became irritated.  He spent\nonly a brief amount of time in Jerusalem, and the miraculous nature of this\ntravels had meant that he did not remember small details and descriptions.  However,\nProphet Muhammad tells us that God showed him the details “right in front of\nhis eyes” and he described what he had seen “stone by stone, brick by brick”. \nThe travellers confirmed his descriptions.\n(Saheeh Bukhari)\nThere is another narration\n[1]\nthat says that\nwhilst travelling back to Mecca, Prophet Muhammad passed over a caravan. He was\nable to describe clearly.  The caravan had lost a camel, and Prophet Muhammad\ncalled from the sky telling them the whereabouts of the camel. He also drank\nfrom their water supply.\nThe people of Mecca immediately dispatched some one to\nmeet the caravan before it entered the city to ask questions about the previous\nnight.  They confirmed that a strange voice called out the location of the lost\ncamel and that part of their water supply had disappeared.  Still these\nconfirmations were not enough.  The people jeered and laughed and disbelieved\nthe words of the Prophet of God.  This miraculous event was such a test of\nfaith that even some of the new Muslims disbelieved and turned away from the\nfaith of Islam.\nThe Sweetness of Faith\nTo those whose faith was strong and true, the Power of\nGod was obvious.  Some of those who found the whole story difficult to believe\nwent to see Abu Bakr, the best friend and loyal supporter of Prophet Mohammad. \nThey asked him if he believed Prophet Muhammad travelled overnight to Jerusalem, and back to Mecca.  Without hesitation Abu Bakr replied, “If the messenger of\nGod said so, then it is true”.  It was because of this occasion that Abu Bakr\nearned the title As-Siddeeq (the foremost believer).  This was a turning point\nfor many Muslims; after already facing the physical torture and abuse of the disbelievers,\nthey now had to grapple with a concept beyond their wildest imaginings.  Some\nfailed, but many soared to new heights and were able to taste the sweetness of true\nsubmission to the One God.\nThe journey by night, from the Holy Mosque in Mecca to\nthe farthest Mosque in Jerusalem, and the ascension through the heavens and\ninto the presence of Almighty God was a miracle granted by God to His final\nslave and Prophet, Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, and\none of the greatest of honours bestowed upon any human.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThe Biography of Prophet Muhammad by ibn Hisham.",

    "content": "At age 40, Prophet Muhammad was an\nestablished trader and family man given to periods of contemplation and\nreflection.  He was a well-respected citizen of Mecca and the people were accustomed\nto coming to him to settle disputes, for advice and to look after their\nvaluables.  All this however was about to change because during one of his\nperiods of isolation and contemplation he was visited by the angel Gabriel and\nthe verses of Quran began to be revealed to him.  His mission had begun; his\nlife was no longer his own - it was now devoted to spreading the word of Islam.\nPerhaps now some of the events in his life began to make\nsense.  Perhaps he could see that God had planned things for him, for in\nretrospect we can see that the signs of Prophethood had been visible in many aspects\nand scenarios throughout Prophet Muhammad’s life.  Before his mission\nMuhammad’s life was relatively easy.  He had a good and happy marriage,\nchildren, no financial worries and no doubt was surrounded by friends and\nfamily who loved and respected him.\nDeclaring his Prophethood soon made him poor, a social\noutcast and his life was threatened on more than one occasion.  Greatness,\npower, wealth and glory were the furthest thing from his mind.  In fact he\nalready had these things, albeit on a small scale.  He had nothing to gain from\ndeclaring a Prophethood and mission that were not true.  Prophet Muhammad, his\nfamily and his followers were ridiculed, derided and physically beaten, his\nlifestyle drastically changed for the worst.\nOne of Muhammad’s companions, said,\n“The Prophet of\nGod did not see bread made from fine flour from the time God sent him (as a Prophet)\nuntil he died.”\n[1]\nAnother declared that\n“When the Prophet died, he did not leave either money\nor anything else except his white riding mule, his arms, and a piece of land\nwhich he left to charity”\n[2]\n.\nBefore he died Prophet Muhammad was the leader of an empire,\nwith access to a national treasury but he lived simply, concerned only with\ncompleting his mission and worshipping God.  Despite his responsibilities as a Prophet,\nteacher, statesman, general,  judge and mediator, Muhammad used to milk his own\ngoats, mend his clothes and shoes, as well as help with the general household\nwork.\n[3]\nProphet\nMuhammad’s life was an outstanding example of humility and simplicity.  His\ndress and lifestyle did not differentiate him from his followers.  When someone\nwalked into a gathering there was nothing about Prophet Muhammad that\ndistinguished him from the other men in the gathering.\nIn the early years of his mission, long before there was\neven a remote possibility of success, Muhammad received an interesting offer\nfrom the leaders of Mecca.  Thinking that Muhammad must be making these claims\nof Prophethood for personal gain an envoy came to him and said “...If you want\nmoney, we will collect enough money for you so that you will be the richest one\nof us.  If you want leadership, we will take you as our leader and never decide\non any matter without your approval.  If you want a kingdom, we will crown you\nking over us...”.  For any human being, in any historical period this would be\na very hard offer to turn down; however Muhammad had no wish for personal gain\nor recognition.  Although there was only one condition to this generous offer\nit was one that went against everything that Muhammad now stood for.  The\nMeccan leaders expected him to give up his call to Islam and to cease\nworshipping God alone, without any partner.\n[4]\nProphet Muhammad flatly refused the offer.\nOn another occasion Muhammad’s uncle Abu Talib feared\nfor his nephew’s life and begged him to stop calling people to Islam.  Again Muhammad’s\nanswer was as decisive and sincere, he said, “I swear by the name of God, O\nUncle!, that if they place the sun in my right-hand and the moon in my\nleft-hand in return for giving up this matter (calling people to Islam), I will\nnever desist until either God makes it triumph or I perish defending it.”\n[5]\nMany means were taken by the disbelieving people of\nMecca to tarnish Muhammad’s character and to belittle the message he was trying\nto spread.  They were particularly merciless when disparaging the Quran itself. \nThey asserted vehemently that the Quran was not divinely revealed and that\nMohammad wrote it himself.  This was done to discourage people from following\nMuhammad or believing his claim to be a Prophet of God.  Prophet Muhammad did\nnot write the Quran.  He was an unlettered man, completely unable to read or\nwrite.  He was unable to know or even guess some of the scientific facts that\nQuran mentions easily and often.\nIn addition to this it makes sense to say that if the\nQuran had been written by Muhammad he would have praised and mentioned himself\na great deal more.  The Quran in fact mentions both Prophet Jesus and Moses\nmany more times by name than it mentions Prophet Muhammad.  The Quran also\nreprimands and corrects Prophet Muhammad.  Would an imposter prophet run the\nrisk of making himself look like a person that can make mistakes?\nProphet Muhammad was an unlettered Arab trader.  His\nlife might have been unremarkable except that from the beginning of his\nexistence God was with him, preparing him for Prophethood and preparing him to\nguide the whole of humanity into a new era of religious growth.  As Muhammad grew\nup, he became known to be truthful, honest, trustworthy, generous, and sincere. \nHe was also known to be very spiritual and had long detested the overt\ndecadence and idolatry of his society.\nWhen we look at the life of Prophet Muhammad from the distance\nof time we can see clearly that his life was one of service to God, his sole\npurpose was to deliver the message.  The weight of the message weighed heavily\non his shoulders and even at his final sermon he was concerned and asked the\npeople to testify that he had delivered God’s message.  If Muhammad had wanted\npower or fame he would have accepted the offer to be the leader of Mecca.  If\nhe had been looking for riches he would not have lived a simple life, dying with\nbarely any possessions, unlike any other powerful leader of an empire.  The\nsimplicity of Prophet Muhammad’s life and his unwavering desire to spread the\nmessage of Islam are strong signs of the validity of his claim to Prophethood.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari\n[2]\nIbid\n[3]\nSaheeh Al-Bukhari, Imam Ahmad\n.\n[4]\nAl-Serah Al-Nabaweyyah,\nIbn Hisham\n, vol.  1.\n[5]\nIbid.",

    "content": "From the miracles of the sayings\nof the Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, is that\nthe Arabian Peninsulawas once a lush green land full of trees and rivers. \nProphet Muhammad said,\n\nThe Last Hour will\nnot come… till the land of Arabia once again becomes meadows and\nrivers.\n[1]\nThere was no way Prophet Muhammad who was illiterate could\nhave known, given the limitation of scientific and technological capabilities\nat the time, such a fact by himself.  What is equally striking is that\ncurrently the Arabian Peninsula is the complete opposite of a lush green place. \nInstead it has one of the hottest climates in the world, with zero permanent\nrivers and about 85% of the 2\nnd\nlargest desert in the world, the\nArabian Desert lies in it as well as the entire largest sand desert in the\nworld, the Empty Quarter (the Empty Quarter has an average rainfall of 4\ninches annually and temperatures can reach an unbearable 54 degrees\ncentigrade).\n[2]\nStudies in geology and archeology have recently confirmed\nto a degree beyond any doubt that the Arabian Peninsula once had a much cooler\nclimate and that it truly was a lush green area full of trees, lakes and rivers. \nSuch is based on the following:\n1)   Scientists have documented that earth\nwitnessed its most resent ice age during the\nPleistocene\nEpoch period that began about 2.59 million years ago and ended about 11,700\nyears ago.\n[3]\nDuring this period large parts of the earth were covered\nin ice and the climate was much cooler than what it is today with average\nglobal temperatures 5°C to 10°C below current average temperatures.  While ice\ncovered parts of Europe, Asia and the America’s, the Arabian Peninsula\nwitnessed a pleasant climate much like Europe’s current climate.\n2)   In 2014 researchers in Saudi Arabia discovered\nfossilized remains of an elephant in the Nafud Desert.  With over 60% of the\nelephant’s fossilized bones intact, including an entire tusk, it remarkably\nindicates that the Nafud desert once had a climate suitable for elephants to\nlive in.  It is also worth mentioning that the discovered elephant was 50%\nlarger in size and about twice the weight of the current day elephant.\n[4]\nMore so, in 2017\nSaudi Arabia’s Centre for International Communication announced the\ndiscovery of fossils of other creatures including crocodiles and seahorses, and\nmore remarkably the discovery, in total, of 10,000 ancient lake and river beds\nacross the Arabian Peninsula.\n[5]\nFurthermore, in 2017\nDr.  Eid Al Yahya, a\nwell-known archeologist, discovered the first ever fossilized mammoth in Saudi \nArabia; and throughout the past decade has discovered and documented over a\nthousand flint spearheads (made of silica) and other advanced large-prey\nhunting tools in remote desert locations that indicate that civilizations once\nhunted in these now barren areas.\n3)   The huge discoveries of oil and gas in the\nArabian Peninsula.  Oil is the remains of dead microscopic plants and animals that\nlived in oceans, rivers or lakes millions of years ago.  The lack of oxygen\nenabled the dead microorganisms to maintain their hydro-carbon bonds which is\nneeded for the formation of oil and gas.  River basins in particular have low\noxygen levels due to constricted water circulation making them the optimum\nplace for the formation of oil and gas.  Heat and pressure and the passing of millions\nof years then caused the formation of oil and gas.\n[6]\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab\nEmirates, as well as other countries in the Arabian Peninsula need no\nintroduction when it comes to their proven oil reserves.  Remarkably the oil\nfields in the Arabian Peninsula are both offshore and onshore (over land; not\nsea).  The legendary Ghawar field in eastern Saudi Arabia is the largest oil\nfield in the world (in proven reserves), has been operating since the 1950’s,\nhas an estimated 70 billion barrels of remaining reserves, and remarkably\ngeographically it is located onshore in both the Empty Quarter and the Arabian\nDesert.  Likewise, the Burgan field in Kuwait is the 2\nnd\nlargest oil\nfield in the world and is also located onshore within the Arabian Desert.  The\ndiscovery of such onshore oil fields means that for millions of years, even\nbefore the last ice age started, the Arabian Peninsula was not the dry barren\nland it is today, instead was a paradise of lakes, rivers and river basins.\n4)   Satellite images taken from space have\nconfirmed that the Arabian Peninsula once had a totally different geography and\nclimate.  The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage reported that\nin the 1990’s Landsat provided imagery of eastern and southern parts of Saudi\nArabia, including the Empty Quarter.  The satellite images revealed old trade\nroutes, river paths and valleys; all of which are now covered by sand dunes.\nIn conclusion, geological and archeological discoveries confirm\nthe saying of the Prophet Muhammad, that the Arabian Peninsula was once full of\nmeadows and rivers; a fact that Prophet Muhammad could not have known by\nhimself except through revelation from God Almighty.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh Muslim\n, Book # 05, Hadeeth # 2208\n[2]\nElizabeth Howell, August 2013, The 10 Biggest Deserts on Earth,\nLive Science\n,\nRetrieved from\nhttps://www.livescience.com/38592-biggest-deserts.html\n[3]\nKim Ann Zimmermann, August 2017, Pleistocene Epoch: Facts about the Last Ice\nAge,\nLive Science Contributor\n, Retrieved from\nhttps://www.livescience.com/40311-pleistocene-epoch.html\n[4]\nKim Ann Zimmermann, August 2017, Pleistocene Epoch: Facts about the Last Ice\nAge,\nLive Science Contributor\n, Retrieved from\nhttps://www.livescience.com/40311-pleistocene-epoch.html\n[5]\nHabib Toumi, September 2018, Ancient Saudi Arabia was once lush and green,\nGulf\nNews\n, Retrieved from\nhttps://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/ancient-saudi-arabia-was-once-lush-and-green-1.2153218\n[6]\nRoger N. \nAnderson,\nWhy is oil usually found in deserts and arctic areas?\nScientific\nAmerican\n,\nRetrieved from\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-oil-usually-found",

    "content": "Introduction\nScience has accomplished enormous progress and\nachievements in genetics since the turn of the 21\nst\ncentury. \nScientists have sequenced and mapped the entire genomes of more than 2800\norganisms/species including human, and the count is on.\n[1]\nMacroevolution of evolution theory tells us that humans,\nas well as other multicellular forms of life, have evolved from primitive\nsingle-celled organisms that fall under the kingdom of prokaryotes or even more\nprimitive.\n[2]\nProkaryotes are single-celled organisms that have no true nucleus as their\ngenome is not contained within a membrane nor distinct from the rest of the\ncell.  They are the earliest and most primitive forms of life found on earth.\n[3]\nIs there a\nchance for this evolution to have taken place from a simple, single cell to a\nhuman being during the age of the universe?\nThe human genome\n[4]\ncontains approximately 3 billion chemical nucleotide base pairs (A, C, T, and\nG).\n[5]\nApproximately 34 million nucleotide bases of the human genome encode for the\nproduction of proteins that are vital to all living processes.\n[6]\nThese 34\nmillion nucleotides are called genes.  Proteins are made of amino acids.  Each\namino acid is encoded for by a codon, and each codon is composed of 3\nnucleotides.\nYou can think of nucleotides as alphabets of 4 letters\npool, and codons as words of 3 letters length.\nThe sequence of these nucleotides within genes is what\ndefines the characteristics and functions of a living organism and its nature;\nwill it be a bacterium, a plant, a fly, a fish, or a human.  The sequence of\nthis coding in human genes, as well as other organisms, is so sophisticated,\nprecise, and well organized that it is comparable to the sequence of alphabets\nin a Shakespeare’s poem, a novel, a thesis, a computer program, or an\nencyclopedia of 2 million words (or 2 volumes).\nAccording to macroevolution, this precise sequence,\ncoding, has come into being by random mutations\n[7]\nand natural selection.\nMaximum Possible Mutations During the Age of the Universe\nWe will try to find out here the maximum number of\nmutations that can occur during the age of the universe based on assumptions\nthat favor evolution.\nThe maximum number of mutations a human genome can\nundergo during its course of evolution from a single cell to a human is 3\nbillion mutations per generation since that is the largest size the genome of\nmammals has reached.  This is an extreme assumption in favor of evolution.  In\nreality, mutation rate ranges approximately between 0.003 and 350 mutations per\ngenome per generation.\n[8]\nThe shortest generation time reported to date is the\ngeneration of\nPseudomonas natriegens\n, a marine bacterium with a\ngeneration time of 9.8 minutes.\n[9]\nNevertheless, going once again to the utmost in favor of evolution, we can assume\nthat we are getting a new generation every one second.  Thus, during the age of\nthe universe,\n[10]\nwhich is about 15 billion years,\n[11]\nthe maximum number of generations that can be reached is:\nUniverse\nage in years × Days per year × Seconds per day\n15 billion × 365 × 86400\nwhich equals less than 10\n18\ngenerations (1 with 18 zeros after it).\nThe last piece of information needed to calculate the\nmaximum number of possible mutations is the population of these single-celled\norganisms.  For that we will assume a very large number that leaves no place\nfor more; the number of atoms in the observable universe that is about 10\n82\n.\n[12]\nThus, based on previous results and generous assumptions,\nthe maximum number of mutations that may occur in the entire universe and\nduring its age is:\nMutations\nper generation × Generations during universe age × Population\n3 billion × 10\n18\n× 10\n82\nwhich equals less than\n10\n110\nmutations\n(1 with 110\nzeros after it).\nNumber of Random Mutations Required for the Evolution into a\nHuman\nThe genes of human genome consist of approximately 34\nmillion nucleotides.\n[13]\nThe largest genome in simple, single-celled organisms,\nprokaryotes, is about 13 million nucleotides.\n[14]\nThus, there is a difference of at least 21 million\nnucleotides between prokaryote organisms and humans.  And for a single cell to\nevolve into a human, the evolutionary process needs to mutate –which may\ninclude insertion– at least 21 million nucleotides with the correct nucleotide\nbase and in the correct sequence.\nIn genes, each amino acid –the building block of\nproteins that are vital to all living processes– is coded for by 3 nucleotides,\nwhich is called a codon.  21 million nucleotides means 7 million codons.\nRandom mutations have one of three effects: Neutral,\nDeleterious (harmful), or beneficial.  Only beneficial mutations can contribute\nto the evolutionary process.\nIn living organisms, there are 20 different amino acids\nand a stop code,\n[15]\nthus, the total is 21.\n[16]\nAny mutation will lead to one of these 20 amino acids or the stop code.\n[17]\nTherefore, each mutation falling inside genes, the\ncoding region of the genome,\n[18]\nhas a chance of approximately 1/21 of not altering the amino acid (i.e. coding\nfor the same amino acid) and thus being a neutral mutation, and a chance of\napproximately 20/21 of altering the amino acid.\n[19]\n70% of\nthese 20/21 mutations are deleterious (harmful) mutations.\n[20]\nNevertheless,\nfor the sake of evolution, we will assume that all mutations which are altering\namino acids are beneficial mutations.  Thus, each mutation has a chance of\napproximately 20/21 of being beneficial.\n[21]\nTherefore, the probability for 7 million codons to\nmutate randomly with beneficial mutations is:\nChance\nof mutation for being beneficial\nto the power of\nNumber of codons\n20/21\nto the power of\n7 million\nwhich equals\n1 to more than 10\n100,000\n(1 with 100,000 zeros\nafter it).\n[22]\nCould natural selection have enhanced the chances of\nmutations in our scenario?  Never, since what natural selection basically does\nis to sustain lineages with beneficial or neutral mutations and to eliminate\nlineages with harmful mutations.  Natural selection does not prevent beneficial\nmutations from being mutated again.  Moreover, in our scenario, we have already\nassumed that all mutations are either neutral or beneficial, and have ruled out\nharmful mutations.  Thus, natural selection cannot do any better in this\nscenario.\nConclusion\nTherefore, we need more than 10\n100,000\n(1\nwith 100,000 zeros after it) random mutations to occur so that a simple,\nsingle-celled organisms may evolve into a human, while we can only get less\nthan 10\n110\n(1 with 110 zeros after it) mutations during the age of\nthe universe, even when the entire universe is a stage for this evolutionary\nprocess.\nAll these calculations were based on human genes –that\nconstitute less than 2% of the genome– without taking into consideration the\njunk region that consumes approximately 98% of the human genome, which turned\nout not to be junk anymore.  The ENCODE Project Consortium was able to assign\nbiochemical functions for 80% of the human genome and found that approximately\n20% of it regulates the genes.  The results of the five-year ENCODE project\nwere published in 2012 in the journals Nature, Science, Genome Biology and\nGenome Research.\n[23]\nThe ENCODE consortium’s 442 researchers, situated in 32 institutes around the\nworld, used 300 years of computer time and five years in the lab to get their\nresults.\nHoping this study was beneficial in shedding some light\non this crucial topic.\n[Comments, rebuttals, and critics on this article are\nwelcomed.

It is not exactly 20/21 because a codon doesn’t mutate\nto itself.  The upper limit of chance was obtained by the equation:\n(63-((64/21)-1))/(64-1) = 20.318/21.  In all cases, the final result of\nprobability reached in this study is the same.\n[20]\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1871816/\n[21]\nThis chance of 20/21 of being beneficial can also be applied in the rare case\nof inserting complete codons or large scale coding.  Because all studies have\nconfirmed that only a small portion of random mutations (in all their kinds)\nare beneficial, while the majority of them are either harmful or neutral.  That\nis obvious since they are random.  Thus, giving it a chance of 20/21 for being\nbeneficial is a very generous assumption (http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-mutation-441,\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1871816/,\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1617134/,\nhttp://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/399695/mutation,\nhttp://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v84/n4/abs/6887250a.html,\nhttp://www.genetics.org/content/148/4/1667.full.pdf,\nand http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/data/pharmacia/1999/Cascalho.xhtml).\n[22]\nTo calculate large digits, you may need a special calculator such as the one at\nhttp://www.ttmath.org/online_calculator.\n[23]\nhttp://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11247.html\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/05/genes-genome-junk-dna-encode\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6099/1159.summary",

    "content": "Often when discussing religion, one hears the statement\nthat none has the right to judge anyone else’s beliefs, or that religion is a\nperson’s private matter and we can not say that it is wrong or right.  Throughout\nhistory, societies have based their laws and ethics upon “absolute truths”\nwhich they deem to be “right”, and this is either a result of an exterior text\nregarded as supreme, or of the trait found in the innate nature of humans that causes\nthem to see certain things as good and others as evil.  Humans, to a limited\nscale, can see certain things as good and evil.  For example, all humans, left\nto their natural state without perversion of the mind, will see feces and urine\nas filthy.  Also, certain deeds, like stealing, killing and lying are also\nknown to be evil, while truth, sincerity, and honor are seen to be lofty.  This\nis a result of a trait that was created in all humans, but as mentioned above,\nthis sense is limited.\nIf one says that they do not have the right to\njudge other’s beliefs or actions, they are, in fact, contradicting themselves. \nIf you were to ask many of these people whether killing infants or suicide is\ncorrect and acceptable, they will naturally answer that it is not.  But when we\nlook into certain societies, such as some religions found in Central America, infanticide\nwas seen to be a way to draw near to their gods.  Also today, in Hindu\nreligion, it is praiseworthy for a wife to kill herself after the death of her\nhusband.  If they truly believe that religion is something left to the\nindividual and that none have the right to interfere or judge them, then this\nwould necessitate allowing that killing babies is something which is correct to\nthose who believe it is praiseworthy, and that people have no right to judge\nthem.\nIf we were to bring this issue to an individual\nlevel, we would see that each person has their individual perception of good\nand evil, whether this perception is based upon religion, law, culture, or\nindividual contemplation.  One might believe that it is perfectly acceptable to\ncommit adultery while another might think it to be wrong.  One might believe that\nit is permissible for them to indulge in narcotics since it is their own body,\nand others might believe it to be a crime.  None would be able to say that\nanything is right or wrong, and all people would be left to their own devices\nto believe and practice what they perceive as “correct.”\nIf we were to implement this belief in society,\nwe would have a community based upon anarchy, where no laws could be legislated\nnor executed, for law is based upon the principle that certain things are to be\ngood and others are evil.  If one were to say that there are certain truths\nagreed to by all humans which can be used to legislate laws, this statement is\ntrue to a certain limit, as we stated that all humans do naturally have a trait\nto know right from wrong in a limited sense.  But as seen, this trait many\ntimes becomes perverted through environmental, psychological, or religious factors,\nin that certain acts which were at one time seen as evil and immoral are later seen\nas sound and acceptable, and some things which do not accord to human nature\nare seen to be the keys to salvation.  This can be clearly observed in\ndemocratic societies which base their laws on the majority.  We see that many\nthings which were considered to be outright absurd or immoral are now socially\nacceptable, to the extent that if one holds a different opinion in regards to\nthe issue, they are seen as outcasts.\nFor this reason, humans cannot be left to their\nown accords to legislate what is correct and incorrect.  Even in societies of\nthe same religion which have instituted the separation of religion and state,\nalthough they are in agreement to those things which they maintained from their\nreligion, they differ greatly in regards to what is deemed correct and\nincorrect in their societies.  What is considered as the legal age of consent\nto sex in France is considered rape in America.  While abortion is legal in one\ncountry, it is a crime in another, and when homosexuality is seen as a valid\nway of life in one society, it is seen as a grave sin in another.\nSo if we now say that the truth is absolute and\none and is not relative to each individual and society, then the next question\nis what are the morals which make truth manifest and who is to decide them? \nWhat are the laws which should be implemented in society?  Should they be\ndecided by lawyers and judges who have reached a level of “legal\nenlightenment”, politicians who usually make decisions for their own benefit or\nthe benefit of their own countries, or philosophers which have come to know the\nuniversal truths through their own contemplation?  As seen earlier, humans cannot\nbe left to decide these issues, lest there be catastrophic results, as seen\ntoday in many societies ridden with numerous ills.  The only One who has the\nright to legislate right and wrong is the One who created us and knows what is\nbest for us, and that is God Almighty.  It is God who created the world and it\nis God who set the scales of justice.  It is God who is perfect and it is God\nwho has no faults whatsoever.\nMost of our discussion has dealt with the issues\nof belief which deal with morality and deeds, but what is even more important\nis those beliefs which deal with God, and this will be discussed in the\nfollowing article.",

    "content": "Those who believe that the truth is relative and that\nall beliefs are correct deem that it is not possible to say that a person’s\nbeliefs are wrong, because religion to them is a purely individual belief.  The\nfalsehood of this statement is quite apparent and we do not need to delve into\ngreat detail to prove it.  If one religion believes that Jesus was a false\nprophet, another maintains he is God, and yet another that he was a human\nspecially chosen to be a prophet, how can they all be true?  Jesus, may the\nmercy and blessings of God be upon him, must inevitably be one of the three\nthings mentioned above, and all three statements cannot be correct.  Therefore,\nas only one of these statements can be correct, whichever is established as\ntrue determines that  the others must then be considered as false.\nThis does not, however, mean that a person does not have\nthe right to believe as they wish, as this is a right that God has invested to\nall humans.  But at the same time, it does not mean that one must take the\nother extreme and say that they are all correct, and that one does not have the\nright to form a judgment about them.  Also, giving a person the right to\nbelieve what he wishes does not necessitate that they have right to openly\npractice or publicize these beliefs, for laws implemented in society always\nlook at the effects of actions at the greater societal level and whether those\nactions are advantageous or harmful to the society at large.\nFrom what we have discussed, we can unequivocally come\nto the conclusion that all the religions found today in the world are either\nall false, or that there exists one among them which is the comprehensive Truth;\nfor although various religions do contain similarities, they also have\nfundamental differences.\nIf we were to say that no religion in the world today is\ncorrect, then this would entail believing that God is unjust because He left us\nto wander about on earth in sin and transgression without showing us the right\nway to do things, and this is impossible for a Just God.  Therefore the only\nlogical conclusion is that there is One True Religion, which contains guidance\nin all spheres of life, religious, moral, societal, and individual.\nHow do we know what this one true religion is?  It is\nupon each and every human to investigate this matter.  Humans were created to\nfulfill a great purpose, not just to eat, sleep and go about finding their\ndaily sustenance and satiate their desires.  In order to fulfill this purpose,\none must try to find what their purpose is, and this can only be done by\ninvestigation.  If one believes that there is a God, and that God must not have\nleft humans to wander in misguidance, then they must search for the religion and\nway of life which God revealed.  Furthermore, this religion would not be hidden\nor hard for humans to find or understand, for that would defeat the purpose of\nguidance.  Also, the religion must contain the same message throughout time, since\nwe mentioned that everything returns to one absolute truth.  Also, this\nreligion cannot contain any falsities or contradictions, for falseness or\ncontradiction in one matter of the religion proves the falsity of the religion\nas a whole, since we would then doubt the integrity of its texts.\nThere is no other religion which fulfills the conditions\nmentioned above except for religion of Islam, the religion which is accordance\nto human nature, the religion which has been preached by all prophets since the\ndawn of man.  Other religions found today, such as Christianity and Judaism,\nare the remnants of the religion brought by the prophets in their time, which\nwas Islam. However, over time, they have been altered and lost, and what is\nleft today of these religions is a mix of truth and falsehood.  The only\nreligion which has been preserved and preaches the same message brought by all\nprophets is the religion of Islam, the one true religion, which rules all\nsphere’s of humans’ lives, religious, political, societal, and individual, and\nit is upon all humans to investigate this religion, to ascertain its truth, and\nto follow it.",

    "content": "The first thing that one should know and clearly understand\nabout Islam, is what the word “Islam” itself means.  The Arabic word “Islam”\nmeans the submission or surrender of one’s will to the only true God, known in\nArabic as “Allah”.  One who submits his will to God is termed in Arabic a\n“Muslim”.  The religion of Islam is not named after a person or a people, nor\nwas it decided by a later generation of man, as in the case of Christianity\nwhich was named after Jesus Christ, Buddhism after Gautama Buddha, Confucianism\nafter Confucius, Marxism after Karl Marx, Judaism after the tribe of Judah and Hinduism after the Hindus.  Islam (submission to the will of God) is the religion\nwhich was given to Adam, the first man and the first prophet of God, and it was\nthe religion of all the prophets sent by Allah to mankind.  Further, its name\nwas chosen by God Himself, and clearly mentioned in the final scripture which\nHe revealed to man.  In that final revelation, called in Arabic the Quran,\nAllah states the following:\n“…This day have perfected your religion for you, completed My\nfavor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…” (Quran 5:3)\n“If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to\nGod), never will it be accepted of him.” (Quran 3:85)\nHence, Islam does not claim to be a new religion brought\nby Prophet Mohammed into Arabia in the seventh century, but rather to be a re-expression\nin its final form of the true religion of Almighty God, Allah, as it was\noriginally revealed to Adam and subsequent prophets.\nAt this point, we might comment briefly on two other\nreligions that claim to be the true path.  Nowhere in the Bible will you find\nGod revealing to Prophet Moses’ people or their descendants that their religion\nis called Judaism, or to the followers of Christ that their religion is called\nChristianity.  In other words, the names “Judaism” and “Christianity” had no\ndivine origin or approval.  It was not until long after his departure that the\nname Christianity was given to Jesus’ religion.\nWhat, then, was Jesus’ religion in actual fact, as\ndistinct from its name?  His religion was reflected in his teachings, which he\nurged his followers to accept as guiding principles in their relationship with\nGod.  In Islam, Jesus is a prophet sent by Allah, and his Arabic name is Eesaa. \nLike the prophets before him, he called upon the people to surrender their will\nto the will of God (which is what Islam stands for).  For example, in the New\nTestament it is stated that Jesus taught his followers to pray to God as\nfollows:\n“Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name, may\nyour will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” (Luke 1 1:2/Matthew 6:9-10)\nThis concept was emphasized by Jesus in a number of his\nstatements recorded in the Gospels.  He taught, for example, that only those\nwho submitted would inherit paradise.\n“Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 7:21)\nJesus also pointed out that he himself submitted to the\nwill of God.\n“I cannot do anything of myself.  I judge as I hear\nand my judgment is honest because I am not seeking my own will but the will of\nHim who sent me.” (John 5:30)\nThere are many reports in the Gospels which show that\nJesus made it clear to his followers that he was not the one true God.  For\nexample, when speaking about the final Hour, he said:\n“No-one knows about the day or hour, not even the\nangels in heaven, not the son, but only the Father.” (Mark 13:32)\nThus Jesus, like the prophets before him and the one who\ncame after him, taught the religion of Islam: submission to the will of the one\ntrue God.",

    "content": "Since the total submission of one’s will to God represents\nthe essence of worship, the basic message of God’s divine religion, Islam, is\nthe worship of God alone.  It also requires the avoidance of worship directed\nto any person, place or thing other than God.  Since everything other than God,\nthe creator of all the things, is God’s creation, it may be said that Islam, in\nessence, calls man away from worship of creation and invites him to worship\nonly his Creator.  He is the only one deserving of man’s worship, because it is\nonly by His will that prayers are answered.\nAccordingly, if a man prays to a tree and his prayers\nare answered, it is not the tree which answers his prayers, but God, who allows\nthe circumstances prayed for to take place.  One might say, “That is obvious.”  However,\nto tree-worshippers, it might not be so.  Similarly, prayers to Jesus, Buddha,\nor Krishna or Saint Christopher, or Saint Jude or even to Muhammad are not\nanswered by them, but are answered by God.  Jesus did not tell his followers to\nworship him, but to worship God, as the Quran states:\n“And behold!  God will say: ‘O Jesus, the son of Mary!  Did\nyou say to men, worship me and my mother as gods besides God?’  He will say:\n‘Glory to you, I could never say what I had no right (to say)...’” (Quran\n5:116)\nNor did Jesus worship himself when he worshipped, but\nrather he worshipped God.  And Jesus was reported in the Gospels to have said:\n“It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and\nserve Him only.’” (Luke 4:8)\nThis basic principle is contained in the opening chapter\nof the Quran, known as Surah al-­Faatihah, verse 4:\n“You alone do we worship and from You alone do we seek help.”\n(Quran 1:5)\nElsewhere, in the final book of revelation, the Quran,\nGod also said:\n“And your Lord says: ‘Call on Me and I will answer your\n(prayer).’” (Quran 40:60)\nIt is worth emphasizing that the basic message of Islam\n(namely, the worship of God alone) also proclaims that God and His creation are\ndistinctly different entities.  God is neither equal to His creation nor a part\nof it, nor is His creation equal to Him or a part of Him.\nThis might seem obvious, but man’s worship of creation\ninstead of the Creator is to a large degree based on ignorance, or neglect, of\nthis concept.  It is the belief that the essence of God is everywhere in His\ncreation or that His divine being is or was present in some parts of His creation,\nwhich has provided justification for the worship of God’s creation and naming\nit the worship of God.  However, the message of Islam, as brought by the\nprophets of God, is to worship only God and to avoid the worship of His\ncreation either directly or indirectly.\nIn the Quran God clearly states:\n“For we assuredly sent amongst every people a prophet, with\nthe command worship God and avoid false Gods…” (Quran 16:36)\nWhen idol worshippers are questioned as to why they bow\ndown to idols created by men, the invariable reply is that they are not\nactually worshipping the stone image, but God, who is present within it.  They\nclaim that the stone idol is only a focal point for God’s essence and is not in\nitself God!  One who has accepted the concept of God being present in any way\nwithin His creation will be obliged to accept this argument for idolatry.  Whereas,\none who understands the basic message of Islam and its implications would never\nagree to idolatry no matter how it is rationalized.\nThose who have claimed divinity for themselves down\nthrough the ages have often based their claims on the mistaken belief that God\nis present in man.  Taking one step further, they claim that God is more\npresent in them than in the rest of us, and that other humans should therefore\nsubmit to them and worship them as God in person or as God concentrated within\ntheir persons.  Similarly, those who have asserted the godhood of others after\ntheir deaths have found fertile ground among those who accept the false belief\nof God’s presence in man.\nIt should be abundantly clear by now that one who has\ngrasped the basic message of Islam and its implications could never agree to\nworship another human being under any circumstance.  God’s religion, in essence,\nis a clear call to the worship of the Creator and the rejection of\ncreation-worship in any form.  This is the meaning of the motto of Islam:\n“Laa Ilaaha illaa Allah” (There is no true god (deity) but God (Allah))\nThe sincere declaration of this phrase and the acceptance\nof prophethood automatically bring one within the fold of Islam, and sincere\nbelief in it guarantees one Paradise.  Thus, the final Prophet of Islam, may\nthe mercy and blessings of God be upon him\n[1]\nis reported to have said:\n“Anyone who says: ‘There is no true god (deity) but God (Allah) and\ndies holding that (belief) will enter paradise.”\nBelief in this declaration of faith requires that one submit\nhis/her will to God in the way taught by the prophets of God.  It also requires\nthe believer to give up the worship of false gods.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\n‘Peace be Upon Him’: A phrase which is stated after mentioning any of the\nprophets out of respect.",

    "content": "Throughout people’s lives, from childhood until the time\nthey die, signs of the one and only true God are shown to them in all regions\nof the earth and in their own souls, until it becomes clear that there is only\none true God (Allah).  God says in the Quran:\n“We will show them our signs in the furthest regions (of the\nearth) and in their souls, until it becomes clear to them that this is the\ntruth…” (Quran 41:53)\nThe following is an example of God revealing by a sign\nto one man the error of his idol-worship.  In the south-eastern region of the\nAmazon jungle in Brazil, South America, a primitive tribe erected a new hut to\nhouse their man-idol Skwatch, representing the supreme God of all creation.  The\nfollowing day a young man entered the hut to pay homage to the God, and while\nhe was in prostration to what he had been taught was his Creator and Sustainer,\na mangy old flea-ridden dog slunk into the hut.  The young man looked up in\ntime to see the dog lift his hind leg and pass urine on the idol.\nOutraged, the youth chased the dog out of the temple;\nbut when his rage died down, he realized that the idol could not be the Lord of\nthe Universe.  God must be elsewhere, he concluded.  As strange as it may seem,\nthe dog urinating on the idol was a sign from God for that young man.  This\nsign contained the divine message that what he was worshipping was false.  It\nliberated him from slavishly following his traditionally learned worship of a\nfalse god.  As a result, this man was given a choice: either to seek the true\nGod or to continue in the error of his ways.\nGod mentions Prophet Abraham’s quest for God as an\nexample of how those who follow His signs will be rightly guided:\n“So also did we show Abraham the power and the Laws of the\nheavens and the earth that he might (with understanding) have certitude.\nWhen the night covered him over, he saw a star.  He said:\n‘This is my Lord.’  But when it set, he said: ‘I love not those that set.’\nWhen he saw the moon rising in splendor, he said: ‘This is my\nLord.’  But when the moon set, he said: ‘Unless my Lord guides me, I shall\nsurely be among those who go astray.’\nWhen he saw the rising sun in splendor, he said: ‘This is my\nLord, this is the greatest (of all).’  But when the sun set, he said: ‘O my\npeople!  I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving partners to God.\nFor me, I have set my face, firmly and truly, towards Him who\ncreated the heavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to God.”\n(Quran 6:75-79)\nAs was mentioned earlier, prophets have been sent to\nevery nation and tribe to support man’s natural belief in God and man’s in-born\ninclination to worship Him, as well as to reinforce the divine truth in the\ndaily signs revealed by God.  Although much of these prophets’ teachings became\ndistorted, portions revealing their God-inspired messages have remained untainted\nand have served to guide mankind in the choice between right and wrong.  The\ninfluence of God-inspired messages down through the ages can be seen in the Ten\nCommandments of Judaism’s Torah, which were later adopted into Christianity’s\nteachings, as well as in the existence of laws against murder, stealing and\nadultery in most societies throughout the ancient and modern world.\nAs a result of God’s signs to mankind through the ages,\ncombined with His revelation through His prophets, all mankind has been given a\nchance to recognize the one only true God.\nConsequently, every soul will be held accountable for\nits belief in God and its acceptance of the true religion of God, namely Islam,\nwhich means total submission to the will of God.",

    "featureImage": "https://de44dj20p4alh.cloudfront.net/articles/Biological_Evolution_001.jpg",
    "content": "Many people\nwonder about the theory of biological evolution – the theory that living\nspecies on Earth today are descended from others in the past, and that the\npresent diversity of living species we see is a result of descent with\nmodification over the course of numerous generations.\nMuslims also wonder about one of the main processes that\nevolutionary theory proposes to explain how evolution takes place – the process\nof natural selection.  This is the idea that the individuals within a\npopulations of living organism vary in their individual traits – they are not\nexactly alike – and that the organisms which are most successful at leaving\ndescendants will pass on their unique traits to the next generation at the\nexpense of the traits possessed by less successful organisms in the population,\nthereby contributing to a long-term gradual change in the suite of traits found\nwithin the population.\nTo start with, it is not our intention in this article\nto discuss the scientific implications of evolutionary theory.  We wish to\nexplore the issue from the perspective of Islamic teachings.\nWe must ask:\nDoes the theory of evolution – and likewise the theory\nof natural selection as a mechanism of evolution – conform to Islamic teachings\nor conflict with them?\nIs a Muslim allowed to believe in evolution as a\nscientific theory as long as he or she accepts that God is behind it?\nIs a Muslim allowed to believe in human evolution?  If\nnot, how can we explain the fossils of upright, bipedal, tool-using apes with\nlarge brains that have been discovered?\nWe wish to re-emphasize that our concern here is not\nwith examining the scientific merits of the theory of evolution.  What we want\nto know is what Islamic teachings have to say about the idea.  Whether\nevolution is true or false scientifically is another matter altogether.\nWhen we look at the sources of Islam – the Quran and\nSunnah – we see that, with respect to human beings living on the Earth today,\nthey are all descendants of Adam and Eve.\nGod also says:\n“O mankind!  We have created you from a male and a female, and\nmade you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another.  Verily, the\nmost honorable of you with God is the one who is the most God-fearing.” (Quran\n49:13)\nThe Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon\nhim, identified the male mentioned in this verse as being Adam.  He\nsaid:\n“Human beings are the children of Adam and Adam was\ncreated from Earth.  God says: ‘O mankind!  We have created you from a male and\na female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. \nVerily, the most honorable of you with God is the one who is the most\nGod-fearing’.” (\nAl-Tirmidhî\n)\nWe also see that God created Adam directly without the\nagency of parents.\nGod says:\n“The similitude of Jesus before God is as that of Adam; He\ncreated him from dust, then said to him: ‘Be’ and he was.” (Quran 3:59]\nWe also know that Eve was created from Adam without the\nagency of parents.\nIn the Quran, God states clearly:\n“O mankind!  Be careful of your duty to your Lord Who created\nyou from a single soul and from it created its mate and from them twain hath\nspread abroad a multitude of men and women.” (Quran 4:1)\nTherefore, the Quran tells us that Adam and his wife\nwere the father and mother of all human beings living on the Earth today.  We\nknow about this by way of direct revelation from God.\nThe direct creation of Adam (peace be upon him) can\nneither be confirmed nor denied by science in any way.  This is because the\ncreation of Adam (peace be upon him) was a unique and singular historical event. \nIt is a matter of the Unseen and something that science does not have the power\nto confirm or deny.  As a matter of the Unseen, we believe it because God\ninforms us about it.  We say the same for the miracles mentioned in the Quran. \nMiraculous events, by their very nature, do not conform to scientific laws and\ntheir occurrence can neither be confirmed nor denied by science.\nWhat about other living things, besides the human beings\nliving on the Earth today?  What about plants, animals, fungi, and the like?\nWhen we turn our attention to this question, we find\nthat the Quran and Sunnah do not tell us much about the flora and fauna that\nwas present on the Earth before or at the time of Adam and Eve’s arrived upon\nit.  The sacred texts also do not tell us how long ago Adam and Eve arrived\nupon the Earth.  Therefore, these are things we cannot ascertain from the\nsacred texts.\nThe only thing that the Quran and Sunnah require us to\nbelieve about the living things on Earth today is that God created them in\nwhatever manner He decided to create them.\nGod says:\n“God is the Creator of all things and over all things He has\nauthority.” (Quran 39:62)\nIndeed, God states specifically that He created all life\nforms:\n“And We made from water all living things.” (Quran 21:30)\nWe know that “God does what He pleases.” God can create\nHis creatures in any manner that He chooses.\nTherefore, with respect to other living things, the Quran\nand Sunnah neither confirm nor deny the theory of biological evolution or the\nprocess referred to as natural selection.  The question of evolution remains\npurely a matter of scientific enquiry.  The theory of evolution must stand or\nfall on its own scientific merits – and that means the physical evidence that\neither confirms the theory or conflicts with it.\nThe role of science is only to observe and describe the\npatterns that God places in His creation.  If scientific observation shows a\npattern in the evolution of species over time that can be described as natural\nselection, this is not in itself unbelief.  It is only unbelief for a person to\nthink that this evolution took place on its own, and not as a creation of God. \nA Muslim who accepts evolution or natural selection as a valid scientific\ntheory must know that the theory is merely an explanation of one of the many\nobserved patterns in God’s creation.\nAs for the fossil remains of bipedal apes and the tools\nand artifacts associated with those remains, their existence poses no problem\nfor Islamic teachings.  There is nothing in the Quran and Sunnah that either\naffirms or denies that upright, brainy, tool using apes ever existed or evolved\nfrom other apelike ancestors.  Such animals may very well have existed on Earth\nbefore Adam’s arrival upon it.  All we can draw from the Quran and Sunnah is\nthat even if those animals once existed, they were not the forefathers of Adam\n(peace be upon him).",

    "featureImage": "https://de44dj20p4alh.cloudfront.net/articles/Thermodynamics_Falsifies_Evolution_(part_1_of_2)_001.jpg",
    "content": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics, which is accepted as one\nof the basic laws of physics, holds that under normal conditions all systems\nleft on their own tend to become disordered, dispersed, and corrupted in direct\nrelation to the amount of time that passes.  Everything, whether living or not,\nwears out, deteriorates, decays, disintegrates, and is destroyed.  This is the\nabsolute end that all beings will face one way or another, and according to the\nlaw, the process cannot be avoided.\nThis is something that all of us have observed.  For\nexample if you take a car to a desert and leave it there, you would hardly\nexpect to find it in a better condition when you came back years later.  On the\ncontrary, you would see that its tires had gone flat, its windows had been\nbroken, its chassis had rusted, and its engine had stopped working.  The same\ninevitable process holds true for living things.\nThe second law of thermodynamics is the means by which\nthis natural process is defined, with physical equations and calculations.\nThis famous law of physics is also known as the “law of\nentropy.” In physics, entropy is the measure of the disorder of a system.  A\nsystem’s entropy increases as it moves from an ordered, organized, and planned\nstate towards a more disordered, dispersed, and unplanned one.  The more\ndisorder there is in a system, the higher its entropy is.  The law of entropy\nholds that the entire universe is unavoidably proceeding towards a more\ndisordered, unplanned, and disorganized state.\nThe truth of the second law of thermodynamics, or the\nlaw of entropy, has been experimentally and theoretically established.  All\nforemost scientists agree that the law of entropy will remain the principle\nparadigm for the foreseeable future.  Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist\nof our age, described it as the “premier law of all of science.”  Sir Arthur\nEddington also referred to it as the “supreme metaphysical law of the entire\nuniverse:”\n[1]\nEvolutionary theory ignores this fundamental law of\nphysics.  The mechanism offered by evolution totally contradicts the second law. \nThe theory of evolution says that disordered, dispersed, and lifeless atoms and\nmolecules spontaneously came together over time, in a particular order, to form\nextremely complex molecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, whereupon millions\nof different living species with even more complex structures gradually emerged. \nAccording to the theory of evolution, this supposed process—which yields a more\nplanned, more ordered, more complex and more organized structure at each\nstage—was formed all by itself under natural conditions.  The law of entropy\nmakes it clear that this so-called natural process utterly contradicts the laws\nof physics.\nEvolutionist scientists are also aware of this fact.  J. \nH.  Rush states:\nIn the complex course of its evolution, life exhibits a\nremarkable contrast to the tendency expressed in the Second Law of\nThermodynamics.  Where the Second Law expresses an irreversible progression\ntoward increased entropy and disorder, life evolves continually higher levels\nof order.\n[2]\nThe evolutionist author Roger Lewin expresses the\nthermodynamic impasse of evolution in an article in Science:\nOne problem biologists have faced is the apparent\ncontradiction by evolution of the second law of thermodynamics.  Systems should\ndecay through time, giving less, not more, order.\n[3]\nAnother defender of the theory of evolution, George\nStravropoulos, states the thermodynamic impossibility of the spontaneous\nformation of life and the impossibility of explaining the existence of complex\nliving mechanisms by natural laws in the well-known evolutionist journal\nAmerican Scientist:\nYet, under ordinary conditions, no complex organic\nmolecule can ever form spontaneously, but will rather disintegrate, in\nagreement with the second law.  Indeed, the more complex it is, the more\nunstable it will be, and the more assured, sooner or later, its disintegration. \nPhotosynthesis and all life processes, and even life itself, cannot yet be\nunderstood in terms of thermodynamics or any other exact science, despite the\nuse of confused or deliberately confusing language.\n[4]\nAs we have seen, the evolution claim is completely at\nodds with the laws of physics.  The second law of thermodynamics constitutes an\ninsurmountable obstacle for the scenario of evolution, in terms of both science\nand logic.  Unable to offer any scientific and consistent explanation to\novercome this obstacle, evolutionists can only do so in their imagination.  For\ninstance, the well-known evolutionist Jeremy Rifkin notes his belief that\nevolution overwhelms this law of physics with a “magical power”:\nThe Entropy Law says that evolution dissipates the\noverall available energy for life on this planet.  Our concept of evolution is\nthe exact opposite.  We believe that evolution somehow magically creates\ngreater overall value and order on earth.\n[5]\nThese words well indicate that evolution is a dogmatic\nbelief rather than a scientific thesis.\nThe Misconception About Open Systems\nSome proponents of evolution have recourse to an\nargument that the second law of thermodynamics holds true only for “closed\nsystems,” and that “open systems” are beyond the scope of this law.  This claim\ngoes no further than being an attempt by some evolutionists to distort\nscientific facts that invalidate their theory.  In fact, a large number of\nscientists openly state that this claim is invalid, and violates thermodynamics. \nOne of these is the Harvard scientist John Ross, who also holds evolutionist\nviews.  He explains that these unrealistic claims contain an important\nscientific error in the following remarks in Chemical and Engineering News:\nThere are no known violations of the second law of\nthermodynamics.  Ordinarily the second law is stated for isolated systems, but\nthe second law applies equally well to open systems.  There is somehow\nassociated with the field of far-from-equilibrium phenomena the notion that the\nsecond law of thermodynamics fails for such systems.  It is important to make\nsure that this error does not perpetuate itself.\n[6]\nAn “open system” is a thermodynamic system in which\nenergy and matter flow in and out.  Evolutionists hold that the world is an\nopen system: that it is constantly exposed to an energy flow from the sun; that\nthe law of entropy does not apply to the world as a whole, and that ordered,\ncomplex living beings can be generated from disordered, simple, and inanimate\nstructures.\nHowever, there is an obvious distortion here.  The fact\nthat a system has an energy inflow is not enough to make that system ordered.  Specific\nmechanisms are needed to make the energy functional.  For instance, a car needs\nan engine, a transmission system, and related control mechanisms to convert the\nenergy in petrol to work.  Without such an energy conversion system, the car\nwill not be able to use the energy stored in petrol.\nThe same thing applies in the case of life as well.  It\nis true that life derives its energy from the sun.  However, solar energy can\nonly be converted into chemical energy by the incredibly complex energy\nconversion systems in living things (such as photosynthesis in plants and the digestive\nsystems of humans and animals).  No living thing can live without such energy\nconversion systems.  Without an energy conversion system, the sun is nothing\nbut a source of destructive energy that burns, parches, or melts.\nAs can be seen, a thermodynamic system without an energy\nconversion mechanism of some sort is not advantageous for evolution, be it open\nor closed.  No one asserts that such complex and conscious mechanisms could\nhave existed in nature under the conditions of the primeval earth.  Indeed, the\nreal problem confronting evolutionists is the question of how complex\nenergy-converting mechanisms such as photosynthesis in plants, which cannot be\nduplicated even with modern technology, could have come into being on their\nown.\nThe influx of solar energy into the world would be\nunable to bring about order on its own.  Moreover, no matter how high the\ntemperature may become, amino acids resist forming bonds in ordered sequences. \nEnergy by itself is incapable of making amino acids form the much more complex\nmolecules of proteins, or of making proteins form the much more complex and\norganized structures of cell organelles.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nJeremy Rifkin, Entropy: A View, Viking Press, New York , 1980, p. 6.\n[2]\nJ.

    "content": "The Myth of the “Self-Organization of Matter”\nQuite aware that the second law of thermodynamics renders\nevolution impossible, some evolutionist scientists have made speculative\nattempts to square the circle between the two, in order to be able to claim\nthat evolution is possible.\nThe two most important theories that emerged as a result\nof that aim were the theory of “self-organization” and the related theory of “dissipative\nstructures.”  The first of these maintains that simple molecules can organize\ntogether to form complex living systems; the second claims that ordered,\ncomplex systems can emerge in unordered, high-entropy systems.\nIf we look carefully at all the evolutionist literature\non this issue, we can see that they have fallen into a very important trap. In\norder to make evolution fit in with thermodynamics, evolutionists are\nconstantly trying to prove that a given order can emerge from open systems.\nTheir problem lies in the — sometimes deliberate —\nconfusing of two distinct concepts: “ordered” and “organized.”\nWe can make this clear with an example. Imagine a\ncompletely flat beach on the seashore. When a strong wave hits the beach,\nmounds of sand, large and small, form bumps on the surface of the sand.\nThis is a process of “ordering.” The seashore is an open\nsystem, and the energy flow (the wave) that enters it can form simple patterns\nin the sand, which look completely regular. From the thermodynamic point of\nview, order can be set up where before there was none. But we must make it\nclear that those same waves cannot build a castle on the beach. If we see a\ncastle there, we are in no doubt that someone has constructed it, because the\ncastle is an “organized” system. In other words, it possesses a clear design\nand information. Every part of it has been made by a conscious entity in a\nplanned manner.\nThe difference between the sand and the castle is that\nthe former is an organized complexity, whereas the latter possesses only order,\nbrought about by simple repetitions. The order formed from repetitions is as if\nan object (in other words the flow of energy entering the system) had fallen on\nthe letter “a” on a typewriter keyboard, writing “aaaaaaaa” hundreds of times.\nBut the string of “a”s in an order repeated in this manner contains no\ninformation, and no complexity. In order to write a complex chain of letters\nactually containing information (in other words a meaningful sentence,\nparagraph or book), the presence of intelligence is essential.\nThe same thing applies when a gust of wind blows into a\ndusty room. When the wind blows in, the dust which had been lying in an even\nlayer may gather in one corner of the room. This is also a more ordered\nsituation than that which existed before, in the thermodynamic sense, but the\nindividual specks of dust cannot form a portrait of someone on the floor in an\norganized manner.\nThis means that complex, organized systems can never\ncome about as the result of natural processes. Although simple examples of\norder can happen from time to time, these cannot go beyond certain limits.\nBut evolutionists point to this self-ordering which\nemerges through natural processes as a most important proof of evolution,\nportray such cases as examples of “self-organization.” As a result of this\nconfusion of concepts, they propose that living systems could develop of their\nown accord from occurrences in nature and chemical reactions. The methods and\nstudies employed by Prigogine and his followers, which we considered above, are\nbased on this deceptive logic.\nHowever, as we made clear at the outset, organized\nsystems are completely different structures from ordered ones. While ordered\nsystems contain structures formed of simple repetitions, organized systems\ncontain highly complex structures and processes, one often embedded inside the\nother. In order for such structures to come into existence, there is a need for\nconsciousness, knowledge, and planning. Jeffrey Wicken, an evolutionist\nscientist, describes the important difference between these two concepts in\nthis way:\n‘Organized’ systems are to be carefully distinguished\nfrom ‘ordered’ systems. Neither kind of system is ‘random,’ but whereas ordered\nsystems are generated according to simple algorithms and therefore lack\ncomplexity, organized systems must be assembled element by element according to\nan external ‘wiring diagram’ with a high information content . Organization,\nthen, is functional complexity and carries information.\n[1]\nIlya Prigogine—maybe as a result of evolutionist wishful\nthinking— resorted to a confusion of these two concepts, and advertised\nexamples of molecules which ordered themselves under the influence of energy\ninflows as “self-organization.”\nThe American scientists Charles B. Thaxton, Walter L.\nBradley and Roger L. Olsen, in their book titled The Mystery of Life’s Origin,\nexplain this fact as follows:\nIn each case random movements of molecules in a fluid\nare spontaneously replaced by a highly ordered behaviour. Prigogine, Eigen, and\nothers have suggested that a similar sort of self-organization may be intrinsic\nin organic chemistry and can potentially account for the highly complex\nmacromolecules essential for living systems. But such analogies have scant\nrelevance to the origin-of-life question. A major reason is that they fail to\ndistinguish between order and complexity... Regularity or order cannot serve to\nstore the large amount of information required by living systems. A highly\nirregular, but specified, structure is required rather than an ordered\nstructure. This is a serious flaw in the analogy offered. There is no apparent\nconnection between the kind of spontaneous ordering that occurs from energy\nflow through such systems and the work required to build aperiodic\ninformation-intensive macromolecules like DNA and protein.\n[2]\nAnd this is how the same scientists explain the logical\nshallowness and distortion of claiming that water turning into ice is an\nexample of how biological order can spontaneously emerge:\nIt has often been argued by analogy to water\ncrystallizing to ice that simple monomers may polymerize into complex molecules\nsuch as protein and DNA. The analogy is clearly inappropriate, however… The\natomic bonding forces draw water molecules into an orderly crystalline array\nwhen the thermal agitation (or entropy driving force) is made sufficiently\nsmall by lowering the temperature. Organic monomers such as amino acids resist\ncombining at all at any temperature however, much less some orderly\narrangement.\n[3]\nIlya Prigogine, one of the most famous proponents of\nself-organization, devoted his whole career to reconciling evolution and\nthermodynamics, but even he admitted that there was no resemblance between the\ncrystallization of water and the emergence of complex biological structures:\nThe point is that in a non-isolated system there exists\na possibility for formation of ordered, low-entropy structures at sufficiently\nlow temperatures. This ordering principle is responsible for the appearance of\nordered structures such as crystals as well as for the phenomena of phase\ntransitions. Unfortunately this principle cannot explain the formation of\nbiological structures.\n[4]\nIn short, no chemical or physical effect can explain the\norigin of life, and the concept of “the self-organization of matter” will\nremain a fantasy.\nSelf-Organization: A Materialist Dogma\nSo why do evolutionists continue to believe in scenarios\nsuch as the “self-organisation of matter,” which have no scientific foundation?\nWhy are they so determined to reject the consciousness and planning that can so\nclearly be seen in living systems?\nThe answer to these questions lies hidden in the\nmaterialist philosophy that the theory of evolution is fundamentally\nconstructed on. Materialist philosophy believes that only matter exists, for\nwhich reason living things need to be accounted for in a manner based on\nmatter. It was this difficulty which gave birth to the theory of evolution, and\nno matter how much it conflicts with the scientific evidence, it is defended\nfor just that reason. A professor of chemistry from New York University and DNA\nexpert, Robert Shapiro, explains this belief of evolutionists about the “self-organization\nof matter” and the materialist dogma lying at its heart as follows:\nAnother evolutionary principle is therefore needed to\ntake us across the gap from mixtures of simple natural chemicals to the first\neffective replicator. This principle has not yet been described in detail or\ndemonstrated, but it is anticipated, and given names such as chemical evolution\nand self-organization of matter. The existence of the principle is taken for\ngranted in the philosophy of dialectical materialism, as applied to the origin\nof life by Alexander Oparin.\n[5]\nThe truths that we have been examining here clearly\ndemonstrate the impossibility of evolution in the face of the second law of\nthermodynamics. The concept of “self-organization” is another dogma that\nevolutionist scientists are trying to keep alive despite all the scientific\nevidence.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nJeffrey S.

    "content": "Why is the universe the way it is?\nOne of the most important questions\nthat almost all thinkers, philosophers and people like you and I have asked is\nWhy does the universe exist at all?  And why is it the way it is? In response\nto this question there are those who say that the universe is uncaused, in\nother words it is eternal, meaning it has no beginning and no end.  If this is\ntrue, there should be an\ninfinite history of past events\n.  However, the\ninfinite in the real world is not possible as it implies a quantity that is\nlimitless.  Let’s take the following examples into consideration: if there were\nan infinite number of books in a room and two were taken away, how many would\nbe left?  The response may be infinity or for those who are logically\ninclined infinity minus two.  In any case, the responses don’t make sense because\nalthough two have been taken away from infinity there still remains infinity!\nConsequently, we’re not able to count the remaining books left in the room. \nTherefore the infinite leads to contradictions and simply doesn’t exist in the\nreal world (although it exists in mathematical discourse; however it is based\nupon certain axioms and conventions).  Therefore, it logically follows that the\nuniverse must have a finite history of past events, which indicates that it must\nhave begun to exist at some point in time.\nThe above may sound too philosophical, but it is also\nsupported by scientific evidence, for instance, Stephen Hawking, in his lecture\nThe Beginning of Time states\n, The conclusion of this lecture is that\nthe universe has not existed forever.  Rather, the universe, and time itself,\nhad a beginning in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago.\n[1]\nAccording to contemporary cosmologists, the universe began at\ntime zero with the event commonly called the Big Bang.  The theory postulates\nthat the universe began as a singularity, an extremely hot and dense entity that\nexpanded and subsequently cooled, going from something incredibly small and hot\nto the current size and temperature of our universe.  In light of these facts,\nit is interesting to note that there is no scientific explanation as to what\nhappened before time zero.  In addition to this, the Big Bang theory can only\npostulate what happened 1 x 10\n-34\nseconds after the Big Bang but not\nanytime before it.  What happened before this particular point in time is\nunknown.\nIn the context of the above discussion, it can be\nconcluded that generally physicists agree that as a result of the Big Bang,\nphysical time and space were created as were energy and matter.  So two\npremises can be drawn from all the above:\n1.\nWhatever\nbegins to exist has a cause\n2.\nThe\nuniverse began to exist - Therefore the universe has a cause.\nHow do we\nget to this conclusion?  Well, if everything we know and see that begins to\nexist has a cause, for example a noise in the room or the pyramids at Giza,\nthen the universe - which also began to exist -must also have a cause.\nThe Cause for the Universe = God?\nOur discussion so far has provided good reasons to\nbelieve that there must have been a cause for the universe.  However, this\ndoesn’t tell us much about what the cause is, but if we think deeply about the\nnature of the cause - also known as conceptual analysis - we can conclude that\nit must be very powerful as it brought into existence the entire universe, and\nit must be:\nOne...\nThe cause for the universe must be a single cause for\nseveral reasons.  An attractive argument to substantiate this claim includes\nthe use of the rational principle called Occam’s razor.  This principle is\ncommonly summarised as the simplest explanation is the best explanation.  In\nphilosophical terms the principle enjoins that we should not multiply entities\nbeyond necessity.  What this basically means is that we should stick to\nexplanations that do not create more questions than it answers.  In the case of\nthe cause for the universe we have no evidence to claim multiplicity, in other\nwords more than one, and if we did it would create more questions than it\nanswers.\nUncaused & Eternal...\nThis cause must also be uncaused due to the absurdity of\nan infinite regress, in other words an indefinite chain of causes.  To\nillustrate this better, if the cause of the universe had a cause and that cause\nhad a cause\nad infinitum\n, then there wouldn’t be a universe to talk\nabout in the first place.  For example, imagine if a Stock Trader on a trading\nfloor at the Stock Exchange was not able to buy or sell his stocks or bonds\nbefore asking permission from the investor, and then this investor had to check\nwith his, and this went on forever, would the Stock Trader ever buy or sell his\nstocks or bonds?  The answer is no.  In similar light, if we apply this to the\nuniverse we would have to posit an uncaused cause due to this rational\nnecessity.\nHowever, some philosophers and scientists claim that\nwhy doesn’t the cause be the universe itself? and why can’t the cause stop\nat the universe? Well, the problem with these claims is that they would imply\nthe universe created itself, which is absurd because how can anything exist and\nnot exist at the same time?  Finally, it would be irrational to claim that\nwhatever begins to exist causes itself!\nImmaterial...\nThe cause has to be immaterial since it created\neverything.  If you were to take any state of physical existence, you would\ncome to the conclusion that, that state of physical existence owes itself to\nanother state of physical existence.  And that state of physical existence,\nowes itself to another state of physical existence.  But you can’t go back\nstates of physical existences\nad infinitum\n.  There has to be a beginning\nto the entire state of physical existences.  Therefore, the logical conclusion\nis that the origin of all creation has to be a\nnon- physical state\n.  After\nthinking about the nature of the cause for the universe we come to the\nremarkable realisation that it has all the basic attributes of the traditional\nmonotheistic God, namely that He is one, eternal and immaterial.  But what reasons\ndo we have to start claiming that a particular religion is true?  This leads us\nto discuss the Quran, the book of the Muslims.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\n(http://www.hawking.org.uk/index.php/lectures/publiclectures/62)",

    "content": "The Quran\nThe Quran is no ordinary\nbook.  It has been described by many, who engage with the book, as an imposing\ntext, but the way it imposes itself on the reader is not negative, rather it is\npositive.  This is because it seeks to positively engage with your mind and\nyour emotions, and it achieves this by asking profound questions, such as “So\nwhere are you people going? This is a message for all people; for those who\nwish to take the straight path.”\n[1]\nand “Have they not thought about their own selves?”\n[2]\nHowever, the Quran doesn’t stop there, it actually\nchallenges the whole of mankind with regards to its divine authorship, it\nboldly states “If you have doubts about the revelation we have sent down to Our\nservant, then produce a single chapter like it – enlist whatever supporters you\nhave other than God – if you truly think you can.\nIf you cannot do this – and you never will – then beware\nof the fire prepared for the disbelievers, whose fuel is men and stones.”\n[3]\nThis challenge refers to the various wonders in the Quran,\neven within its smallest chapter, that give us good reasons to believe it is\nfrom God.  Some of these reasons are historical and scientific.\nHistorical...\nThere are many historical statements in the Quran that\nshow us good reasons that it is from God.  One of them is that the Quran is the\nonly religious text to use different titles for the rulers of Egypt at\ndifferent times.  For instance while addressing the Egyptian ruler, at the time\nof Prophet Yusuf (Joseph), the word “Al-Malik” is used which refers to a king\n(note: that during the middle old kingdom Hyksos Asiatic families were\ngoverning Egypt and they did not use the title Pharaoh, as the Quran mentions\n“The King said, 'Bring him to me straight away!’”).\n[4]\nIn contrast, the ruler of Egypt at the time of the\nProphet Musa (Moses) is referred to as Pharaoh, in Arabic “Firaown”.  This\nparticular title began to be employed in the 14th century B.C., during the\nreign of Amenhotep IV.  This is confirmed by the Encyclopaedia Britannica which\nstates that the word Pharaoh was a title of respect used from the New Kingdom\n(beginning with the 18th dynasty; B.C.  1539-1292) until the 22nd dynasty (B.C. \n945-730).\nSo the Quran is historically accurate as the Prophet\nYusuf lived at least 200 years before that time, and the word “King” was used\nfor the Hyksos kings, not Pharaoh.\nIn light of this, how could have the Prophet Muhammad\nknown such a minute historical detail? Especially when all the other religious\ntexts, such as the Bible, just mention Pharaoh as a title for all times? Also,\nsince people at the time of the revelation did not know this information and\nhieroglyphs were a dead language, what does this say about the authorship of\nthe Quran? There is no naturalistic explanation.\nScientific...\nThe Quran always mentions nature as a sign for God’s\nexistence, power and majesty.  Every time these are mentioned, they are\nexpressed with a great accuracy, and they also give us information that could\nhave never been known at the time of the Prophet Muhammad.  One of these signs\nincludes the function and structure of mountains.  The Quran mentions that\nmountains have “peg” like structures and that they have been embedded into\nearth to stabilise it, a concept known in Geology as isostasy.  The Quran\nmentions: “We placed firmly embedded mountains on the earth, so it would not\nmove under them…”\n[5]\nand “Have We not made the earth as a bed and the mountains its\npegs?”\n[6]\nThe Quran’s eloquent renderings of the facts mentioned\nabove are confirmed by modern science which only came to be understood by the\nend of the 20th Century.  In the book\nEarth\n, by Dr. Frank Press, former\npresident of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, states that mountains are\nlike stakes, and are buried deep under the surface of Earth.\n[7]\nWith regards to the vital role of mountains, it was\nformerly understood that mountains were merely protrusions rising above the\nsurface of Earth.  However, scientists realised that this was not actually the\ncase, and that the parts known as the mountain roots extended down as far as 10\nto 15 times their own height.  With these features, mountains play a similar\nrole to a nail or peg firmly holding down a tent, which has been discovered by\nmodern geological and seismic research, a concept known as isostasy.\n[8]\nIn conclusion, how can we explain this in the light\nof the fact that this is relatively recent science (with no one at the time of\nthe revelation knowing this information)? What does this tell you about the\nauthor? Again, there is no naturalistic explanation.\nIs Life Absurd without God?\nThe writer Loren Eiseley said that man is a cosmic\norphan.  This is quite profound, as man is the only creature in the universe\nwho asks: why? Other animals have instincts to guide them, but man has learned\nto ask questions.  If many of these questions raised by man exclude God then\nthe conclusion is simple:\nwe are the accidental byproducts of nature, a\nresult of matter plus time plus chance.\nThere is no reason for your\nexistence and all we face is death.  Modern man thought that when he had got\nrid of God, he had freed himself from all that repressed and stifled him.  Instead,\nhe discovered that in killing God, he had also killed himself.\nIf there is no God, then man and the universe are doomed. \nLike prisoners condemned to death we await our unavoidable execution.  What is\nthe consequence of this? It means that life itself is absurd.  It means that\nthe life we have is without ultimate significance, value, or purpose.  For\nexample, according to the atheist worldview this life is purposeless, or at\nbest, just assembled to propagate our DNA.  The way some atheists get out of\nthis is by saying we can create purpose for ourselves, however this is a\nself-delusion as we try and find some purpose by attributing purpose to the\nthings we do in life, but remove purpose from our very own lives.  Also,\nwithout God our lives do not have any ultimate meaning.  If our ends are the same,\nin that we just pass out of existence, what meaning does that give our lives?\nDoes it even matter if we existed at all? If the universe was never in\nexistence what difference would it make?\nExistentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert\nCamus understood the meaningless reality of life in absence of acknowledging\nthe purpose of our existence.  This is why Sartre wrote of the “nausea” of\nexistence and Camus saw life as absurd, indicating that the universe has no\nmeaning at all.  The German Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued in clear\nconcise pronouncements that the world and human history do not have any\nmeaning, any rational order or aim.  Nietzsche argued that there is only a\nmindless chaos, a directionless world tending towards no end.  It is not wonder\nthe philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said he would have wished the world never\nexisted.  All of these views on the world are absurd conclusions carved by the\natheist world view.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nQuran Chapter 81 Verses 26 – 28\n[2]\nQuran Chapter 30 Verse 8\n[3]\nQuran Chapter 2 Verse 23\n[4]\nQuran Chapter 12 Verse 50\n[5]\nQuran Chapter 21 Verse 31\n[6]\nQuran Chapter78 Verses 6-7\n[7]\nFrank Press, and Raymond Siever, Earth, 3rd ed.  (San\nFrancisco: W.  H.  Freeman & Company: 1982\n[8]\nM.  J.  Selby, Earth's Changing Surface (Oxford: Clarendon\nPress: 1985), 32.",

    "content": "Any publicity is good publicity.  These words have been written\nand uttered so many times it is impossible to attribute the quote to any one\nperson.  Any publicity is good publicity; meaning that it is better that\nsomething receives bad publicity rather than no publicity at all.  In the past\ndecade we have been swamped with bad publicity about Islam, yet conversion\nstatistics indicate that the number of people converting to Islam is growing at\na phenomenal rate.  Why is this so?  Because wise people do not believe\neverything they read and see, they question, they apply critical thinking\nskills, they acquire knowledge and form their own conclusions.\nFinding the correct information does not come easily. \nYou need to search, to look for your proofs and evidences.  Do you want to know\nabout Islam? Which one of the thousands of books will you turn to first?\nEverything you ever wanted to know about is out there is cyber space waiting\nfor the click of a mouse or the touch of a screen.  Type Islam into Google\nsearch and what do you come up with? 479 million results in just .21 of a\nsecond.  Pretty impressive, but where do you start? Now here is a novel answer,\nhow about at the beginning, back where it all began.  Let us begin when God\nspoke to the angels.\n“‘Verily, I am going to place mankind generations after\ngenerations on earth.’  They said: ‘Will You place therein those who will make\nmischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with praises and thanks\nand sanctify You.’  God said: ‘I know that which you do not know.’” (Quran\n2:30)\nGod knows what we do not know and contrary to what many\nwould have us believe His words are not hidden and they are not obscure.  Do\nyou want to know about Islam, do you want to prove to yourself that Islam is\nthe true religion bestowed upon mankind? There is an easy methodology that will\nhelp you sort through the hundreds of thousands of different bits of\ninformation available.  It begins with the Quran.\nThe second verse of the second chapter of Quran begins\nwith the words,\n“This is the book whereof there is no doubt, guidance to those\nwho are righteous...”\nGod knows that every human being is searching for\nthat elusive connection and He says to humankind - this is the book, this is\nthe guidance you have been searching for.  Is this enough? Yes it could be. \nThroughout the centuries people have converted to Islam merely from hearing the\nrecitation of Quran, still others have embraced Islam after hearing the soulful\ncall to prayer.  Some people convert to Islam after observing a way of life\nthat combines, tolerance and respect with forgiveness and mercy and then there\nare those who need proof.\nHowever, asking for proof is not to the seeker’s\ndetriment.  Our religion, the way of life that is Islam, is not based on guess\nwork, it is based on the words of God and the authentic teachings of His\nmessenger Prophet Muhammad.  Islam is the religion of informed knowledge, not\nblind faith.  When Pharaoh asked Prophet Moses who was the Lord of humankind\nand all that exists, he, Moses, answered,\n“The Lord of the heavens and the\nearth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with\ncertainty”. (Quran 26: 24 & 25)\nSeek to be convinced.  Hold a copy of\nQuran in your hands and read, contemplate and ponder.  Seek your evidence and\nprepare to be amazed.\nThe Quran tells us about the power of God and how it\noperates in the universe.  It explains that God’s knowledge encompasses all\nthings and that He is not only the Creator but also the Sustainer of the\nuniverse.\nEvidence of the truth of Islam can be found in the\nscientific evidence that is found throughout the Quran.  Some people like to\ncall them miracles - scientific miracles in the Quran.  There is complete\nconsistency between many of the discoveries of modern science and the words of\nGod written down more than 1400 years ago.  Amazing scientific facts that could\nnot have been known until recently tend to prove that the Quran is the word of\nGod and thus that Islam is the true religion of all human beings.  Logic tells\nus that 21\nst\ncentury knowledge in the 6\nth\ncentury could\nnot be a coincidence.\nQuran speaks eloquently about human embryonic\ndevelopment, and the fact that mountains have deep roots under the surface of\nthe ground.  It describes one of the undisputed facts of cosmology, that the\nuniverse was formed out of the remnants of smoke.  Quran even describes the\nprefrontal area of the cerebrum as the place where lies and sins originate. \nModern science tells us that this is the area responsible for planning, and\ninitiating and the area responsible for choosing either good or sinful\nbehaviour.\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be\nupon him, was unable to read or write yet scientific facts are also found in\nhis authentic sayings and traditions.  While teaching and counselling his\nfollowers, Prophet Muhammad mentioned scientific facts including the seven\nlayers of the earth’s crust.  In depth articles backed up by evidence from\nscientists and doctors can be found on this web site and many others.\nIn part 2 we will continue to examine the Quran and\nlearn more about its miraculous nature; we will look at more evidence for the\nexistence of God and discuss how logical proofs can only lead to one\nconclusion.",

    "content": "In part 1 we\ndiscussed the miraculous nature of Quran and asked a question.  How is it\npossible for a book written in the 6th century CE to contain knowledge only\navailable in the 20th century CE?  We came to the logical conclusion that the\nQuran is the word of God.  However, is this enough, are scientific miracles\nproof that the Quran is the word of God? Yes, this may be enough for\nsome, but others may want to look at further proofs. There are\nother aspects that can be taken into consideration\nparticularly pertaining to what is often referred to as the linguistic nature\nof Quran.\nIn the 7\nth\ncentury CE the\nArabs, although predominantly illiterate, were masters of the spoken word.  Their\npoetry and prose were considered a model of literary excellence.  When Prophet\nMuhammad recited the Quran, the Arabs were moved by its sublime tone,\neloquence, and extraordinary beauty.  Amongst the Arabs, even those who\nrejected the call to Islam, there was no doubt that the words of Quran came\nfrom no earthly source.\nThe Quran challenges all to try and come forth\nwith\neven a single chapter\nlike\nit, whose shortest chapter, al-Kawthar, consists of only three verses.\n“And if you are in doubt concerning that which\nWe have sent down to Our servant, then produce a chapter like it and call your\nwitnesses besides God if you be truthful.  If you do not do so – and you\nwill never do so – then fear a fire whose fuel is men and stones prepared for\nthe disbelievers.” (Quran 2:23-24)\nThe challenge stands till today and no one\nhas been able to bring something even close to the Quran since the time of its\nrevelation.\nThus, this fact demands us to ask yet\nanother question.  How do we know that these words of God were not changed over\nthe centuries?  The words we read and ponder over today, are the same words\nread over 1400 years ago.  More than 1.5 billion Muslims believe this and they\ndo so because God Himself promised to preserve and protect the Quran.  God\nbestowed on humankind the gifts of hearing, seeing and thinking.  Thus we use\nour minds, ears and eyes to examine the authenticity of Quran.\n“And God brought you out of your mother’s wombs\ndevoid of all knowledge, but He has endowed you with hearing, vision, and intellect, so that you may be grateful.” (Quran16:78)\nThe words of\nthe\nQuran have\nremained unchanged due to careful memorisation and meticulous recording.\nAs the Quran was being revealed, it was memorized by\nthe companions of Prophet Muhammad and then carefully\ntransmitted generation after generation.  According to one\nestimate there are over 10 million people today who have memorized the book\ncover to cover.If the\nbook were to disappear it would be easily possible to\nreclaim each word, in the correct order with the correct pronunciation.\nBesides, t\nrustworthy\nscribes\nalso\nwrote down the revelation on flat stones, bark, bones, and\neven animal skins.  During his lifetime Prophet Muhammad supervised this himself. \nOver the centuries Muslims and non Muslims alike have\nexamined copies of Quran, some more than 1000 years old and found that they are\nall identical, apart from the introduction of vowel marks in the 7th century CE. \nThese marks were introduced to further guard the authenticity of Quran by demanding\nstrict adherence to pronunciation rules.\n“It is We Who have sent down the remembrance\n(i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it from corruption.” (Quran 15:9)\nHaving established that, the Quran contains knowledge that could only be known by God and\nconfirming the authenticity of the words we have in front of us today, we have\nagain reached the same logical conclusion – that the Quran and thus the\nreligion of Islam is the religion of truth.  When learning about Islam it is\npossible at every turning point to research and recheck.  However one might ask\nwhy the coming of Prophet Muhammad was not mentioned in previous revelations\nfrom God?  The answer to this question is - he most certainly was mentioned.\nThe Quran both confirms and abrogates the\nbooks that were sent from God before it, including the Jewish Torah and the\nGospels of Jesus.  In our quest to confirm the truths of Islam we can look at\nthese books and find clear predictions\n[1]\nof the coming of Prophet Muhammad.  The first chapter of the Old Testament refers\nto the coming of a prophet and all but describes Prophet Muhammad.  Prophet\nMuhammad could neither read nor write and the words of Quran that he spoke were\nwords revealed to him by God.\n“I will raise them up a Prophet from among their\nbrethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall\nspeak unto them all that I shall command him” (Geneses 18:18)\n“Neither does he speak out of his own desire:\nthat [which he conveys to you] is but [a divine] inspiration with which he is\nbeing inspired.” (Quran 53:3-4)\nIn John 14:16 Jesus speaks to his\ndisciples saying\n“And I will\npray to the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide\nwith you forever.”\n[2]\nHe even said “…if I go not\naway, the Comforter will not come unto you.”\n[3]\nWho exactly is the comforter?  Jesus was clearly\nreferring to the\nM\nessenger of God\n- Muhammad,\nwho would come after him\nand glorify him\n[4]\n.  In his traditions, Prophet Muhammad glorifies\nJesus in terms impossible to misinterpret.\nWhoever\ntestifies that none deserves worship except God, who has no partner, and that\nMuhammad is His servant and Messenger, and that Jesus is the servant of God,\nHis Messenger, and His Word which He bestowed in Mary, and a spirit created\nfrom Him, and that Paradise is true, and that Hell is true, God will admit him\ninto Paradise, according to his deeds.\n[5]\nAlthough there is no evidence to suggest\nthat Hindu scriptures were revealed by God there is evidence that learned\nrighteous Hindu scholars were searching for universal truths.  The truths, that\nconnect humankind with a higher power.  The Hindu scriptures also mention\nProphet Muhammad.  In the Samveda Book II Hymn 6 verse 8 it says “Ahmed\n[6]\nacquired from his Lord the\nknowledge of eternal law.  I received light from him just as from the sun.”\nAccording to Bhavishya Purana in the Prati\nSarag Parv III Khand 3 Adhay 3 Shloka 5 to 8.  “A malecha (belonging to a\nforeign country and speaking a foreign language) spiritual teacher will appear\nwith his companions.  His name will be Mohammad.”\n[7]\nSo far, we have established that the Quran\ncontains knowledge unable to be proven until many centuries after it was\nrevealed.  We used this fact and others to acknowledge\nthat God Himself is the one who spoke the Quran.\n[8]\nThe Quran is one of two principle sources of Islam;\nthe other is the authentic teachings and traditions of Prophet Muhammad.  In\nthis article we have also established that Prophet Muhammad was predicted in\nsacred scripture, both from other monotheistic faiths (Judaism and\nChristianity) and Hinduism.  Our next logical step and the subject of part 3 is\nto authenticate Prophet Muhammad’s prophet hood, and thus provide evidence that\nthe second principle source of Islam is the truth.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nA full\ndiscussion of the Biblical prophecies referring to Prophet Muhammad can be\nfound at the following web site – (http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/200/viewall/)\n[2]\nBible - American Standard Version\n[3]\nJohn 16:7 Ibid.\n[4]\nJohn:16:14 Ibid\n[5]\nSaheeh Bukhari\n[6]\nAhmad is the same name as Muhammad, both meaning the praised one.\n[7]\nProphet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in\nHindu Scriptures by Dr. Zakir Naik.\n[8]\nFor a more detailed discussion on the miraculous nature of the Quran,\nplease refer to the article “The Miraculous Quran”– (http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/528/viewall/)",

    "content": "A very insightful\nperson once said that if we want to establish the truth of the religion\nMuhammad bought to all humankind , we should first gather all the reliable\nsources, namely the Quran and then authentic traditions; after a thorough study\nand evaluation what is left, is Islam.  In our series of articles we have so\nfar learned that asking logical questions leads us to logical answers.  By\ndoing this we have discovered the miraculous nature of the Quran, including the\nadvanced scientific knowledge contained therein and the sublime linguistic\nnature of Quran.   We also discovered that the words of Quran have remained\nunchanged, from the moment they were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad almost\n1500 years ago, until now.  Thus logic tells us that Quran, one of the two\nprimary sources of Islam was written by no earthly source.   We will now look\nat the other primary source of Islam, the Sunnah, or the authentic traditions\nof Prophet Muhammad.\nThe first question that needs careful\ncontemplation is whether or not Prophet Muhammad was a prophet of God.  More\nthan 1.5 billion Muslims, believe without doubt that he\nwas, however those searching for evidence of the truth of Islam may need proof. \nThe most obvious place to find proof is in the authentic traditions of Prophet\nMuhammad, known as the Sunnah.   The sayings, actions, habits and silent\napprovals of one of history’s most observed men.\nMany people have claimed that Muhammad\ndeclared himself a Prophet for fame and glory.  If we look into the authentic\ntraditions, meticulously recorded for posterity, we find that Prophet\nMuhammad’s call to Islam actually stripped him of the fame and glory he already\npossessed.  Before the Quran was revealed to him, and before he became God’s\nmessenger Muhammad was a member of the most influential tribe in Mecca.   In\nhis own right he was known in Mecca and surrounds as the most trustworthy man\namong all the tribes.  After announcing his Prophethood Muhammad and his\nfollowers became social outcasts.\nIn authentic traditions and biographies we\nlearn that Prophet Muhammad and the new Muslim community were persecuted and\neven tortured.   Sanctions were enforced and families disowned their own sons\nand daughters, leaving many to be beaten and starved by the more aggressive\nmembers of Meccan society.  Muhammad’s followers came from all social ranks,\nfrom slaves to wealthy traders and entrepreneurs.  Within a short space of time\nmany people including Prophet Muhammad, had lost respect, status and wealth.  Muhammad’s\nclaim to Prophethood was not for fame or glory.  Prophet Muhammad said, “By\nGod, if they place the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand to\nleave this matter i would not leave it, until God makes it apparent or until I\nam killed calling people to it”.\n[1]\nNor was it for status or wealth.  The Meccan\nelders offered Prophet Muhammad money and prestige to renounce his call to\nIslam.  They even offered to make him the leader of all the tribes and clans\nyet he consistently refused even when they said, “\nIf you are doing all this\nwith a view to getting wealth, we will join together to give you greater riches\nthan any Quraishite has possessed.  If ambition moves you, we will make you our\nchief.  If you desire kingship we will readily offer you that”.\n[2]\nMuhammad’s\nclaim to prophet hood was not for wealth or status\n.\nThe traditions of\nProphet Muhammad give us an insight into his life.  We are\nable to see and understand the life of a man of God.  Every moment of his life\nwas a preparation for his coming prophet hood and this is obvious to all those\nwho believe in God.\nResearching the miracles of Prophet\nMuhammad in both the traditions and the Quran, is a logical step that often convinces\nthose from a Christian or Jewish background of the truth of Islam.  Prophet\nMuhammad is the last in a long line of recognisable prophets.  Noah, Abraham\nMoses, and Jesus are all Prophets of Islam and a Muslim is required to believe\nin all of them.  God gave Prophet Muhammad to the world to complete His message\nnot destroy it.  For many Islam fills in the gaps and reawakens faith.\n“I am the nearest of all the people to\nthe son of Mary, and all the prophets are paternal brothers, and there has been\nno prophet between me and him (Jesus).” Prophet Muhammad.\n[3]\n“Those to whom We gave the Scripture (Jews and Christians)\nrecognise him (Muhammad) as they recognise their sons.” (Quran2:146)\nGod supported His Prophets with miracles\nthat are observable and they serve as a sign of a true Prophet.   At the time of Jesus, the Israelites were very knowledgeable in the\nfield of medicine.   Consequently, the miracles Jesus performed (by the\npermission of God) were of this nature and included returning sight to the\nblind, healing lepers and raising the dead.   Prophet Muhammad’s major miracle\nwas the Quran.  As mentioned earlier, even those who did not believe in Muhammad’s\nmessage knew the Quran to be literature beyond compare.  The traditions of Prophet\nMuhammad contain many other miracles including water flowing from his fingers\nand trees deliberating shading him.   Researching these events is certainly one\nway to confirm the truth of Islam.\nPerhaps, finding clear evidence is not\nquite so easy for those from non monotheistic faiths or with no religious\ninclinations at all.  However, following our suggested methodology, asking\nlogical questions, and expecting and searching for logical answers may reveal\nsome unexpected truths.  The Quran invites humankind to ponder and contemplate. \nGod invites all of humankind, those with and without religious or spiritual\nconvictions, to search for the truth.   One should  read,\nresearch, ponder and question, then reach a logical conclusion.  God’s message\nto humankind is not hidden.  It is out there within everybody’s grasp.\n“(This is) a Book (the Quran) which We have sent\ndown to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that\nmen of understanding may remember.” (Quran 38:29)\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nIbn Hisham\n[2]\nAr-Raheeq Al-Makhtum\nTHE SEALED NECTAR by Saifur Rahman\nal-Mubarakpuri.  Dar-us-Salam Publishers and Distributors Saudi Arabia.\n[3]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari",

    "content": "In the previous three articles\nwe discussed a suggested methodology for proving the validity and truth of\nIslam.  When researching it is important to not only ask logical questions but also\nto expect a logical answer.  In essence Islam is a message and guide from the\nCreator to the creation, therefore it should make sense.  Thus we research and\nask all the relevant questions.  What is Islam and what do Muslims believe?  Soon,\nsometimes very quickly, or after long hours, months or years of study we\ndiscover the answer, but what happens now?  When it becomes clear that Islam is\nthe true religion, what should be your next move?\nAt this point, the point where the sheer overwhelming\npower of God becomes self evident it would make perfect sense to embrace the\nreligion of Islam.  Many people do just that.  They begin their new life’s\njourney secure in the knowledge that they are standing firmly on the right path. \nHowever, the research does not end there.  Islam tells us that acquiring\nknowledge is a life long journey.  New Muslims busy themselves in learning their\nnew religion and marvel at the simplicity of a life lead by instructions from\nthe Creator.\nOthers however feel driven to ask more questions, seek\nmore answers and delve deeply into issues that are not immediately necessary.  The\nage old saying, you must walk before you can run, is no less true when you\napply it to learning about Islam.  There is no relevant point to asking\nintricate questions when you have no yet understood the basics well.  Believing\nin Islam as the truth implies accepting the whole message even if the meaning\nbehind, or reason for many rulings is not completely understood.  This may seem\nlike a dilemma, especially if your research has led you to understand that Islam\nis the religion of informed knowledge not a religion based on blind faith.\nHowever trying to understand the wisdom in the secondary details before looking\nin to the proofs of Islam and its fundamentals, is not a good idea, because even\nif you find the wisdom in a few things but disagree with the main message, then\nthere is no real benefit as it will not get you anywhere\n.\nGod does what He does for reasons that are at times\nbeyond our comprehension and for reasons that may or may not be apparent.  A\nMuslim learns to understand and accept this statement, not automatically or\nwith blind faith, but by establishing a connection with God.\nA Muslim is encouraged to maintain\na connection and one easy, yet beneficial way of doing this, is to contemplate\nand understand His Beautiful Names.   Through these names, we are able to know\nour Creator and learn how to praise and worship Him.  We also gain an insight\ninto how and why God’s wisdom and justice is sometimes beyond our understanding.\nThe names Al-Hakeem (The Wise) and Al-Hakam (The Judge)\nindicate God is the source of all wisdom, in His creation and in His commands,\nand He is the Judge of all things.   He is the One Who created everything, and\ntherefore He alone knows the true wisdom of everything. He judges with fairness\nand does not oppress anyone the slightest.   God is just in all His decisions. \nThis may be evident when one embraces Islam or it might be a slow realisation.\nGod’s unending justice and wisdom may not always be clear;\nit takes time and effort to truly understand the details.  Asking petulant\nquestions can lead to confusion.  Once one has established the truthfulness of\nIslam the next step is to accept the entire message, embrace the religion and\nlearn to pray.  It is no coincidence that the first pillar of Islam is to\nbelieve, with no reservations that God is One and that Mohammad is His\nmessenger and that the second pillar is to pray.   Prayer establishes the\nconnection and opens wide the path to lifelong learning and knowledge.   Prophet\nMuhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, spoke to his\ncompanions about both the importance of learning about Islam in a sensible\norder, and the importance of gaining knowledge.\n...so let the first thing to\nwhich you will invite them be the Oneness of God.  If they learn that, tell\nthem that God has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and\none night.\n[1]\nWhoever follows a path in the\npursuit of knowledge, God will make a path to Paradise easy for him.\n[2]\nAsking questions about minor details and expecting to understand\neverything before conversion is a pointless exercise.  One must assess the primary\nsources of Islam, both the Quran and the authentic traditions of Prophet\nMuhammad, ask logical questions, and obtain logical answers to establish\ntruthfulness.  If s person is satisfied that Islam is the true religion of\nhumankind he or she should embrace the faith without delay and begin to learn\nits practices and details.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSaheeh\nAl-Bukhari\n[2]\nIbid.",

    "featureImage": "https://de44dj20p4alh.cloudfront.net/articles/Philosophical_Reflections_part_1._001.jpg",
    "content": "These philosophical reflections are\nmy thoughts on; truth, success, purpose, death, thinking, and worldview.  They\nwere written with the intention to express my initial thinking that led to my\ncurrent conclusions on life.  I have deliberately ended on questions rather\nthan answers, as I wanted to provide a conceptual framework for readers who may\nnot share my worldview, and to seek the answers for themselves.  Relevant\nQuranic verses have been included as introductory literary devices to evoke\nthought and set the mental scene.  This approach is a major theme in the Quran,\nas it frequently mentions, “Do you not reflect?”\nThere is an African proverb that states “He who asks\nquestions, cannot avoid the answers”, so I hope these reflections will evoke\nthought and facilitate guidance for all those who seek it.\nTruth\n“The truth is from your Lord, so on no account be among the\ndoubters.” (Quran 2: 147)\n“Do not mix the truth with falsehood, or hide the truth when you know it.” (Quran\n2: 42)\nThe question of truth has perplexed the mind of nearly\nevery human being that has lived on this planet.  What is truth? How do we get\nto know truth? Is there such a thing as truth? This type of thinking dates back\nto the ancient Greek Philosopher Socrates, as a young man he endlessly questioned\nand sought after the truth.  However, in our day and age we do not really think\nabout concepts such as truth.  We may have argued, “tell me the truth!” if we\nsuspect our friends of betrayal, or we “swear to tell the truth” in a court of\nlaw, but when it comes to our existence, and questioning what it means to be a\nhuman being, we forget about truth and adopt skepticism as a philosophy.\nSkepticism answers in the negative the following\nquestion: can we know anything? It essentially implies the belief that the\ntruth about life and the universe will never be known.  Founded by Pyrrho of\nElis, Skepticism was advocated and put into writing by the Greek Philosopher\nSextus Empiricus who was the first to detail and codify the doctrine.  This\nschool of philosophy is common in today’s society, however, its approach\nregarding truth is unwarranted because we can discover it, and the only way to\ndo that is by endless, insistent questioning.  Socrates was great at\nquestioning and by doing so he would bring his opponents to realise the truth,\nand this is because he believed the truth was already within us.  For example,\nthere are many universal principles that we can never deny, and to deny them\nwould deny knowledge itself.  For instance, take two planks of wood that are\nequal in length: do we know they are equal because they are the same length or\ndo we know what the concept of equality is prior to our experience? It is\nbecause we have the innate, inbuilt concept of equality that enables us to see\nthat the planks of wood are the same length.  Also, we know that half of\nsomething is less than its whole, and we know the truth of the fact that all\nfathers are men.  These innate ideas and concepts are known in epistemology as\na priori, which means knowledge independent from experience.\nFrom a practical perspective the skeptic’s position is\nuntenable, because we know the truth of the laws of physics that enable bridges\nto withstand heavy loads, including the laws that keep boats afloat.  If a\nskeptical position was assumed when building our houses, would we agree to\nimplement the architect’s design? The Polish Philosopher Leszek Kolakowski\nwrites,\n“We might say: well, since we know nothing, what is the\npoint of constructing theories that have no foundation? But if philosophers and\nscholars had seriously attempted to achieve such self-satisfied serenity, would\nthey have been able to build our civilization? Would modern physics have been\ninvented?”\nSo there are some universal truths that we can feel\nsecure in accepting, and the way to find out further truths is to use these\nuniversal truths as a starting point, which is called epistemic foundationalism\nin the language of philosophy.\nThe importance of truth has been emphasized by many\nthinkers past and present.  Plato the ancient Philosopher said “And isn’t it a\nbad thing to be deceived about the truth, and a good thing to know what the\ntruth is? For I assume that by knowing the truth you mean knowing things as\nthey really are.” So why is the search for truth important? The significance of\ntruth is not only intuitive; it is something that gives us a sense of reality,\nthat things are real.  In absence of truth life on occasions can seem unreal\nand illusory in a certain sense.  Additionally, many psychologists have\nacknowledged that human beings want to be right and seek to learn from social\nnorms when they are unsure about things, this psychological process is known as\n‘Normative and Informational Social Influence’.  In this view the search for\ntruth is very important as it has the possibility of shaping who we are or the\nperson we want to be.\nAnother way of looking at this is that not searching for\ntruth is tantamount to lying to ourselves, or even accepting a lie, because\nanything other than truth will be accepting it’s opposite.  So the search for\ntruth would be a means of trying to be more sincere with our own existence, as\nwe would be seeking to establish the truth of who we are and the life we are\nliving.  Finally, holding on to the skeptical view that there is no truth is self-defeating,\nbecause the claim that there is no truth is actually a truth claim, so how can\nanyone claim that skepticism is true but everything else is not? This is the\ninconsistency of the skeptical view; a skeptic would claim the truth of\nskepticism but would deny all other truths! Consequently no matter what\nposition we hold we still have to accept a truth, and in this light, let the\nsearch for truth begin!",

    "content": "Success\n“…they are the ones who are successful.” (Quran 7:157)\n“Truly, this is the supreme success!” (Quran 37:60)\nOne of the best definitions I have\nfound of success is “the completion of what is intended”.  For example, if I\nwere to intend to learn how to drive, and I passed my driving test, that would\nbe a success.  As human beings we intend to achieve things all the time; to get\na promotion; to be our own boss; to be a good father and husband; to travel the\nworld or to write a book.  If we achieve or complete our aims and objectives\nthen it can be argued we have been successful.  However is this view of success\nmeaningful?  I would argue it is not.\nIf we live our lives to complete the things that we\nintend to achieve, without even questioning the intention of our own existence,\nwe will have not found any ultimate meaning to our own lives.  Therefore our\nview of success is almost baseless and devoid of real value.  If each person\ncompletes his life by intending to achieve all of the things we mentioned, and\nhe or she didn’t even complete the intended meaning for his or her life, then\ncan we call their lives successful? We can even ask: does it really matter\nwhether they ever existed at all? His or her life may be of some importance\nrelative to the things they want to complete, but what is the ultimate\nsignificance of completing their own lives?\nLet’s look at it from a scientific perspective, our\nchildren, our actions, our loved ones and everything we do are just arrangements\nof molecules.  Carbon and other atoms in various combinations make up our lives\nand even the things we intend to complete.  From this perspective mankind is\nthus no more significant than a swarm of flies, or a herd of sheep, for their\nmakeup is all the same.  Also, if we follow the scientific line of thought our\nend is also meaningless, we just die and that’s it.  This is true for each\nindividual person.  The amazing achievements of the scientist to the\nadvancement of human thinking, the on-going research of bio-medicine to find\nthe cure for cancer, the efforts of the politician to establish justice and\npeace in the world, all these come to nothing.  Even if human beings were to\nexist forever, the mere infinite duration of our lives would not make them any\nmore meaningful, there would still be no ultimate significance.\nExistentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert\nCamus understood the meaningless reality of life in absence of acknowledging\nthe intention of our existence.  This is why Sartre wrote of the “nausea” of\nexistence and Camus saw life as absurd indicating that the universe has no\nmeaning at all.  The German Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued in clear\nconcise pronouncements that the world and human history does not have any meaning,\nany rational order or aim.  Nietzsche argued that there is only a mindless\nchaos, a directionless world tending towards no end.\nIf we found the intention of our existence, thereby\ngiving our lives ultimate meaning, and we were to achieve and complete what was\nintended – that would indeed be true success.  In contrast to this type of\nthinking someone may contend by stating that this whole discussion assumes that\nsome metaphysical entity created the whole universe with some sort of purpose. \nThis is true, but by removing this assumption we will only be presuming atheism\nto be true.  Additionally, the logical conclusion of atheism is that our very\nexistence is pointless, which is a conclusion not many atheists would like to\nfollow through due to it being at odds with our innate nature and psychological\ndisposition.  So the following questions naturally follow, what is the\nintention of our existence, and what outlook would make sense of our continuous\nsearch for ultimate meaning and success?\nPurpose\n“So where are you going?” (Quran 81:26)\n“Our Lord! You have not created all this without purpose” (Quran 3:191)\n“God did not create all these without a true purpose; He explains His signs to\nthose who understand.” (Quran 10:5)\nThe Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who\ninspired two of the 20th century’s principal philosophical movements, once\nsaid, “I don’t know why we are here, but I’m pretty sure that it is not in\norder to enjoy ourselves.” Wittgenstein did not have the answer to the\nperennial question of what is humanity’s purpose, but he did indicate that\nthere must be one, even if the answer could not be discovered intuitively.  However,\nit can be argued that the assumption that there is a purpose may be false, and\nif it is false, then there is nothing to be bothered about, and we should all\njust carry on living.  As Albert Camus, the French Algerian philosopher and\njournalist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, explained “You will\nnever live if you are looking for the meaning of life”.  Camus’ point is not\nontological, it doesn’t probe into the nature of reality, and his concern seems\nto be an existential one, meaning that the important thing is how life works\nfor you, the life of individual; regardless of any truth behind existence.  So\nin light of this we must ask: is it reasonable to believe we have a purpose?\nTo answer this, take the following points into\nconsideration:\nYou are probably reading this in your bedroom sitting on\nyour chair, and you are definitely wearing some clothes.  So I ask you a\nquestion: for what purpose? Why are you wearing the clothes and what purpose\ndoes the chair fulfill? Since these are rhetorical questions you don’t have to\nanswer, because we all know the answer.  The chair’s purpose is to allow us to\nsit down by supporting our weight, and our clothes fulfill the purpose of\nkeeping us warm, hiding our nakedness and making us look good! Now from your\nbedroom let me transport you to a forest somewhere in the world, now this\nforest obviously has trees and on a particular tree there is a moth.  This moth\nis on this tree drinking its sap, underneath that moth there is another moth\nand its role is somewhat bizarre, it drinks the excrement of the first moth.  This\nis because the first moth almost instantaneously removes its waste while\ndrinking the sap.  You are probably thinking where I am going with this, well;\nfirstly let us discuss what the purpose of the second moth is.  Its purpose is\nto clean up the excrement of the first moth in order to prevent it trickling\ndown the tree so that ants, and other insects, would not be encouraged to\ntravel up the trail and in consequence eat the first moth.  So in simple terms\nthe second moth is the first moth’s insurance policy!\nNow take this into consideration, you probably didn’t know\nanything about this moth three minutes ago, in fact if moth genocide were to\noccur, you wouldn’t really care – well most of you anyway.  However, we\nattribute purpose to such an insignificant creature, and coming back to our\nclothes and the chair, which are inanimate objects with no emotional and mental\nfaculties, we attribute purpose to these too! Still, we do not attribute\npurpose to our own existence? Is this not absurd?",

    "content": "Believing that we have no purpose is not only\nirrational, it is practically problematic because it presents an indication\nthat a lot of the things we have achieved as humans beings most probably would\nnot have happened as many of the people who have accomplished amazing\nachievements, including the discovery of penicillin, would not have had the\ndrive to attain what they did.  This is because these very people had a purpose\ndriven approach to life, without which we would be just like animals obeying\nour instincts, in other words chemical robots wandering around waiting for the\nbattery acid to dry up! The realities of a purposeless existence was also\nhighlighted by the Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer who claimed that the world\nis bankrupt and there is no reason to rejoice in its existence, he even argued\nthat it would be better if it did not exist and questioned whether suicide was\na plausible solution.\nSo why is it irrational? Well, it is irrational because\nif everything complex and designed that we discover seems to have a purpose,\nincluding the insignificant moth, as well as the things we develop and create,\nthen it logically follows that we have a purpose too.  To deny this would be\ntantamount of believing in things without any evidence, as there is no evidence\nto say we have no purpose, on the contrary we have evidence to say that things\nhave a purpose and we can infer that about ourselves too.  Even scientists\nindicate that it is irrational to assert that our universe is impersonal and\nthe product of blind chance.  Interestingly they have explained that the\nphysical processes in the universe have some sort of purpose, for instance the\nAstronomer Sir Fred Hoyle described the universe with the attributes of God,\nand the physicists Zeldovich and Novikov asked why did nature choose to create\nthis universe instead of another?\nFinally, we can argue that without a purpose we do not\nreally have a deeper profound meaning to our life.  For instance if we take the\nlogical conclusion of an apathetic scientific view on our existence, we are on\na sinking ship.  This ship is called the universe, because according to\nscientists the universe is going to suffer a heat death, and one day the Sun\nwill destroy the earth.  Therefore this ship is going to sink, so I ask you,\nwhat is the point of reshuffling the deck chairs or giving a glass of milk to\nthe old lady? As Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the Russian writer and essayist said,\n“Without some goal and some effort to reach it, no one can live.”\nVarious contentions can follow from this discussion;\nfirstly a purposeless worldview gives us more freedom to create purpose for\nourselves.  To further explain, some existentialists have argued that our life\nis actually based on nothing, and from this nothingness we can create a new\nrealm of possibility for our lives, and therefore create purpose for ourselves. \nThis philosophy rests on the idea that everything is meaningless and that we\nshould create a new language for ourselves in order to live fulfilling lives.  The\nflaw with this approach is that it uses meaning to claim meaninglessness; it\nalso represents a self-delusion as they deny purpose but create one for themselves. \nAdditionally it implies that there are no objective moral values and truths\nbecause an ontological foundation is absent.  This is counter-intuitive and\nopposes our cross-cultural consensus of our moral thinking.  The philosophy of\nwar is a good example to show this type of moral consensus.  For 2,500 years\nthere was a cross-cultural agreement that poisons should not be used in war,\neven if you were being defeated.  Although in practice people did not always\nconform, but they did however agree to this rule.\nAnother contention includes the evolutionist’s stance\nthat our purpose is to propagate our DNA, as Richard Dawkins in his publication\n‘The Selfish Gene’ states that our bodies have been developed to do just that. \nThe problem with this analysis is that it relegates our existence to a random\naccident via a lengthy biological process, in essence the value of our life\nloses its meaning and morality is relegated to individual taste, as Michael\nRuse a Philosopher of Science states,\n“Morality is a biological adaptation no less than are\nhands and feet and teeth… Morality is just an aid to survival and reproduction and\nany deeper meaning is illusory.”\nThe evolutionary perspective creates more problems than\nit solves as it cannot provide an adequate explanation for consciousness and\nthe presence of our rational faculties.  Taking consciousness as an example,\nhow can a subjective immaterial reality come from a material substance?\nConsciousness is not a physical thing; it is not contained in any cell or\nbiological structure.  The most unchallenged and intuitive reality is that we\nare all aware, but we cannot describe or explain what this awareness is.  One\nthing that we can be sure of is that consciousness cannot be explained biologically\nor chemically, the main reason for this is that evolution doesn’t discover\nconsciousness; it’s actually the other way round.  For evolution to try and\nexplain the truth of consciousness would be tantamount to arguing in a circle!\nEven scientists recognise this, the physicist Gerald Schroeder points out that\nthere is no real difference between a heap of sand and the brain of an Einstein. \nIf those advocating a physical explanation for consciousness, bigger questions\nwould need answering such as ‘how can certain bits of matter suddenly create a\nnew reality that has no resemblance to matter?’\nSo if consciousness cannot be explained physically then\nthe next question must be asked, ‘how did it come to be?’ The history of the\nuniverse indicates that consciousness just spontaneously arose and language\nemerged without any evolutionary forerunner.  Even the neo-atheists have failed\nto come to terms with the nature of consciousness or its source, because no\nphysical explanation is coherent enough to convince.  Even the neo-atheist\nRichard Dawkins admits defeat concerning consciousness, he states “We don’t\nknow.  We don’t understand it.”\nIn conclusion there are more reasons to believe that we\nhave a deeper purpose rather than the other options of purposelessness and the\ncold valueless propagation of our DNA.  Realising that we have a purpose is the\nbest explanation via the inferences we make concerning the universe and the\nthings around us.  Even the Scottish Philosopher David Hume was attributed of\nsaying “A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence”, so in this case, it\nwould be wiser to conclude that human beings must have a purpose, and let us\nnot forget that it nourishes us with a more significant explanation for our\nexistence.  However, the following question naturally arises: what is our\npurpose?",

    "featureImage": "",
    "content": "Death\n“Every soul is certain to taste death.” (Quran\n21:35)\n“Death will overtake you no matter where you may be” (Quran 4:78)\nDeath is something we as living beings\ndo not enjoy thinking about.  It creates the realisation within us that all of\nthe attachments we have built in this world are no longer going to be.  Significantly,\nit awakens us to the brutal fact that we will no longer exist on the planet.  There\nhave been many philosophies on death, for example thinkers discussed that death\nis an interruption to life, like sleep or a disease, only permanent.  Others\nexplained that death is to be considered as part of life, something which every\nperson has to come to terms with in order to live well; part of what is\ninvolved in accepting our finitude.  Some thinkers claimed death is to be\nconsidered as a transition from this life to an afterlife, the eternal life of\nbliss or pain.\nWhatever our views on death are, one\nthing we can all agree on is that it is something that we do not think about\nenough.  This may sound morbid but there is a profound value of reflecting on\ndeath, it brings about the actualisation that we are all human beings with a\nshort life.  Our egos will no longer seem that important, our attachments and\ndesires to the material world are put into perspective, and our lives are\nquestioned; all of which is a source of great benefit, as the 11th century\nTheologian and Philosopher al-Ghazali said, “…in the recollection of death\nthere is reward and merit.” Contemplating about death provokes thought and give\nus that window in our lives to really reflect on the ephemeral nature of our\nexistence.\nIn light of death, how should we view\nlife? What does it tell us about the importance we attach to things, and how\ndoes it deliver meaning to our existence? If we view life through the lenses of\ndeath we seem to be in an emotional and intellectual space where we can really\nassess our situation on this planet.  How did I come to be? What should I be\ndoing here? Where am I going? Death is the driving force behind these critical\nquestions, because the moment we recognise that this life is short and that we\nwill breathe our last one day, it puts everything into perspective.\nSo let us reflect on death; imagine you\nare here one minute and the next you are no more.  You have probably\nexperienced loved ones that have passed away; how did you feel? Was there not a\nsense of loneliness, emptiness and lack of attachment to the things we used to\ntake so seriously? Now if you were to taste death right now, as every human\nbeing will, what would that mean to you? What would you want to have done\ndifferently if you were given the chance to go back? What thoughts and ideas\nwould you take more seriously? And what would your outlook be if you could\nre-live your life once experiencing the tragic reality of death?\nThe sad thing about death is that we\ncan’t go back to change our perspectives, or to think about life, or to\nchallenge our outlook and detach ourselves from the empty nature of worldly\nlife.  The good thing though, something that we can begin to do is to take the\nbrave step to deeply reflect on death, and best of all we could make all of\nthese changes now, right this minute.\nThinking\n“…for those who reflect.” (Quran 10:24)\n“…and he taught Adam the names of everything…” (Quran 2:31)\n“Do they not use their minds?” (Quran 6:32)\n“Do they not reflect within themselves?” (Quran 30:8)\nHow should we think? How can we\nunderstand the world around us? What methods should we use to gain a true\nunderstanding of the world? These questions have puzzled the minds of many great\nthinkers throughout history.  Our human tradition is full of debates and\ndiscussions trying to find answers.  The likes of Locke, Hume and Kant, and\nmany others have tried to provide answers to shed light on the perennial debate\nconcerning our understanding of the world.  Some of these thinkers, such as\nLocke, claimed that our knowledge of the world is limited to our perceptions\nonly, in other words knowledge is dependent on our sense experience, also known\nas a posteriori in epistemology, which forms the empiricist tradition in\nphilosophy.\nLocke argued that our minds were a\nblank sheet, a tabula rasa, waiting to be written on by experience.  Other\nthinkers like Leibniz argued, in his ‘Nouveax Essais sur l’entendement humain’,\nthat as human beings we have innate concepts and ideas that are necessary to\nunderstand the world around us, known as a priori in epistemology, which means\nthat knowledge can be gained independent of sense experience, and forms the\nrationalist tradition in philosophy.  Leibniz’s view seems to be a stronger\nposition as it is makes more sense, however some philosophers and scientists\ndeny this and claim that you can’t think of examples of things we can know\nindependent of our sense experience.  This is not true; take the following\nexamples into consideration:\n·Circles have no corners.\n·4+4 = 8.\n·Time is irreversible.\n·Everything that begins to\nexist has a cause.\n·The whole is greater than\nits half (just eat half an apple!)\n·Causality\nLet’s take causality as an example to\nillustrate that we can’t just rely on sense experience.  Causality can be known\nwithout experience because we bring it to all our experience, rather than our\nexperience bringing it to us.  It is like wearing yellow-tinted glasses,\neverything looks yellow not because of anything out there in the world, but\nbecause of the glasses through which we are looking at everything.  The\ncontention that this is just an assumption is not true because without\ncausality we would not be able to have the concept of the real world, and we\nwould not understand our sense experience.  Take the following example into\nconsideration; imagine you are looking at the White House in Washington DC.  Your\neyes may wander to the door, across the pillars, then to the roof and finally\nover to the front lawn.  Now contrast this to another experience, you are on\nthe river Thames in London and you see a boat floating past.  What dictates the\norder in which you had these experiences? When you looked at the White House\nyou had a choice to see the door first and then the pillars and so on.  However\nwith the boat you had no choice as the front of the boat was the first to\nappear.\nThe point to take here is that you\nwould not have been able to make the distinction that some experiences are\nordered by yourself and others are ordered independently, unless we had the\ninnate idea of causality.  In absence of causality our experience would be very\ndifferent from the way it is.  It would be a single sequence of experiences only:\none thing after another.\nSo it seems that the correct way of\nforming conclusions is by using our innate ideas and the experiences of the\nworld around us, in other words using rational thought or what some people call\nreason.  Just relying on our experience of the material world would not be\nsufficient as a method of thinking as it would not be able to confirm political\ntruths, moral truths, mathematical truths, logical truths, and let’s not forget\nto mention a fundamental truth like causality.",

    "featureImage": "",
    "content": "Though we can understand the world\naround us using rational thought, how can we formulate an argument or verify\nour conclusions? Well, this lies in the study of logic which essentially means\nthe principles of reasoning, with particular emphasis on the structure of our\narguments.\nLet’s illustrate the use of logic in\nthe following example: if our friend Mary says “John is coming to dinner\ntonight”, and David says “Mary is not coming to dinner tonight”.  Is what they\nsay consistent? Well, logic would tell us that if they are referring to the\nsame person and the same day then no, their statements would not be consistent. \nHowever if they are referring to a different person or a different day then yes\ntheir statements would be consistent.\nSo let’s combine the two processes.  John\nsays “Whatever begins to exist has a cause and the universe began to exist,\ntherefore the universe has a cause”.  Now from a logical perspective it is a\nvalid argument as the last statement “therefore the universe has a cause”\nlogically follows from the first two statements.  But this doesn’t mean it is\nrational or reasonable.  In order to find out that it is reasonable we would\nhave to investigate using our innate ideas and our sense experience to see if\nthe first two statements are true.  If they are, then the conclusion will not\nonly be a valid argument but it would also be a sound argument.\nJust relying on empiricism would not\ngive us an answer as it would lead us to suspend judgment on whether the\nuniverse has a cause or not because it cannot be sensed.  However this would be\nequivalent of denying the existence of your great great great great great great\ngreat grandmother, because there is no empirical evidence for her existence.  You\nmay argue “but I wouldn’t be here today!”, that is true, but that would be using\nrational thought to form that conclusion, as you would have deduced that you\nmust have had a great great great great great great great grandmother as all\nhuman beings must have had a grandmother in order to exist.\nThis is how all of us should start to\nthink about life and the universe, so we could form the right conclusions using\nvalid arguments.\nWorld-view\n“But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good\nfor you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you.  And God\nKnows, while you know not.” (Quran 2:216)\nLive and let live, don’t harm others\nand you’ll be fine.  This makes sense, right? Even to the point that it\nshouldn’t be questioned.  But why is this? Why do we automatically accept some\nideas and reject others? Why do certain viewpoints seem agreeable to us yet we\ndisagree with others, all without really thinking about them?\nThe answer lies in the concept of a\nworld-view.  A world-view is a philosophy of living that enables us to make\nsense of life and our daily experiences.  The world-view we adopt affects the\nway we process ideas, and allows us to understand society and our place in it. \nA world-view is important in particular association with our society today –\nthis is because the contemporary world has had a huge effect on human\npsychology.  We seem unable to deal with the unpredictable changes and\nincreased complexity of life – subsequently stress, uncertainty and frustration\nbecome common and our minds are overloaded with information.  A world-view is\nthe framework that ties all of this together, and allows us to understand\nlife’s complexity and unpredictability, it helps us make the critical decisions\nthat will shape our future and our own selves, and it aids us in providing a\npicture of the whole.\nWorld-views vary and can range from\nbeing shallow to comprehensive.  A shallow world-view is one that just gives us\nthe framework to react to day-to-day experiences, such as work and friendships. \nThis type of world-view is usually formed via our previous experiences in life\nand it develops by creating templates of understanding the world by\ncontemplating on our history with it.  This type of world-view is problematic\nas it obstructs us from progression by maintaining an inflexible fixation on\nthe past, with no possibility of viewing the world in a positive or different\nway that will enable our transformation.  It is limited in its scope as it\nbecomes only as comprehensive as your experiences, and individually our\nexperiences are very limited.\nA comprehensive world-view, as\ndiscussed by the philosopher Leo Apostel, encompasses everything in life and it\nincludes various components, for instance it provides a model for the world by\nanswering the basic question “who are we?” In addition it provides an\nexplanation usually answering “why is the world the way it is?” and “where did\nwe come from?” Another important part of a comprehensive world-view includes\nextrapolating from the past into the future to answer the question “where are\nwe going?” It should endeavour to answer “what is good and what is evil?”, in\nother words to include morality and ethics, while giving us a sense of purpose,\ndirection and goals for our actions.  Additionally, the answer to the question\n“what for?” may help us to understand the real meaning of life and a\ncomprehensive world-view must answer “how should we act?” thereby helping us to\nsolve practical problems.  Lastly a comprehensive world-view should answer the\nquestion “what is true and what is false?”, this is equivalent to what in\nphilosophy is called “epistemology” or “the theory of knowledge”, therefore it\nwould allow us to distinguish between what is correct and what is incorrect.\nFor any situation there are various\npossible outcomes all of which are dictated by the world-view that someone adopts. \nInstead of discussing the actions, or fruits, of a world-view the foundations\nof the world-view should be challenged and validated.  So the world-view that\nis more correct or has stronger intellectual foundations should be the one to\nadopt.\nThis is why when looking into Islam the\nprimary focus should not be an assessment of women’s rights, clothing and on\ninstances sensationalized by the media, because the assessment of these will be\nbiased and skewed in line with your existing world-view.  But rather, the\nintellectual foundations of any world-view should be assessed for its truth,\nand the one with greater reasons to believe in its truth should be the world-view\nto adopt, because it will be in line with the principle of: whatever comes from\ntruth is true.\nSo let the journey begin!",

    "content": "What is Fine-Tuning?\nOver the past century, scientists\nhave discovered that if certain properties of the universe were changed very\nslightly from what they are, we would not be here.  They have to be within a\nvery narrow range for our universe to make life possible and be habitable.\nThe universe is fine-tuned for the existence of\nintelligent life with a complexity and delicacy that literally defy human\ncomprehension.  The sensitivity of the ‘habitability’ of the universe to small\nchanges is called ‘fine-tuning.’\nThis was recognized about 60 years ago by Fred Hoyle who\nwas not a religious person at the time he made the discovery.  Scientists like Paul\nDavies, Martin Rees, Max Tegmark, Bernard Carr, Frank Tipler, John Barrow, and\nStephen Hawking, to name a few, believe in fine-tuning.  These are prominent\nnames in cosmology as they are heard in the media whenever a news headline is\nmade.\nTypes of Fine-Tuning\n1.  Fine-tuning of the laws of nature.\n2.  Fine-tuning of the constants of physics.\n3.  Fine-tuning of the initial conditions of the\nuniverse.\nWe will explore each category below:\n1.  Fine-Tuning of the Laws of Nature\nThere are two ways to look at this aspect of\nfine-tuning:\n1.    Precisely the right laws are needed for\nhighly complex life to exist.  If one of these were missing, such life would\nnot be possible.  To say that the laws are fine-tuned means that the universe\nmust have precisely the right set of laws in order for highly complex life to\nexist.  Perhaps this type of fine-tuning is the easiest of the three to\nunderstand.\nExample 1\n: The law\nof gravity states that all masses attract each other.  What would the universe\nbe like if gravity did not exist? There wouldn’t be any stars or planets.  Matter\nwould be equally distributed around the universe with no place for life to form\nor energy sources like the sun that provide food to plants through\nphotosynthesis that in turn become food for animals.\nExample 2\n: One type\nof force can play multiple roles in this very well designed system.  For\nexample, the electromagnetic force refers to the combination of electric and\nmagnetic forces.  James Clerk Maxwell unified the two forces in 1800’s.\nIf there were no electromagnetic force, there would be\nno atoms because there would be no force to hold the negatively charged\nelectrons with the positively charged protons that allow for chemical bonds.  There\nwould be no building blocks of life as there would be no chemical bonding, and\ntherefore no life.\nThe electromagnetic force plays another role in light\nwhich is a type of electromagnetic radiation.  It allows energy to transfer\nfrom the sun to our planet.  Without this energy we would not exist.\n2.    Harmony between nature and mathematics: Only\nin the 20th century have we come to understand that what we observe in nature can\nbe described by only a few physical laws, each of which is described by simple\nmathematical equations.  Just the fact that these mathematical forms are so\nsimple and few in number that they can all be written on one sheet of paper is\namazing.\nTable1.  The\nFundamental Laws of Nature\n·Mechanics (Hamilton’s Equations)\n·Electrodynamics (Maxwell’s Equations)\n·Statistical Mechanics (Boltzmann’s\nEquations)\n·Quantum Mechanics (Schrödinger’s Equations)\n·General Relativity (Einstein’s Equation)\nFor life to exist, we need an orderly and intelligible\nuniverse.  Furthermore, order at many different levels is required.\nFor instance, to have planets that circle their stars,\nwe need Newtonian mechanics.\nFor there to be multiple stable elements of the periodic\ntable to provide a sufficient variety of atomic building blocks for life, we\nneed the atomic structure given by the laws of quantum mechanics.\nWe need the orderliness in chemical reactions that is\nthe consequence of Boltzmann’s equation for the second law of thermodynamics.\nAnd for an energy source like the sun to transfer its\nlife-giving energy to a habitat like Earth, we require the laws of\nelectromagnetic radiation that Maxwell described.\n[1]\nPhysicist and Nobel Prize winner Eugene Wigner in his\nwidely quoted paper,\nThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the\nPhysical Sciences\nnotes that scientists often take for granted the\nremarkable - even miraculous - effectiveness of mathematics in describing the\nreal world.  He says:\nThe enormous usefulness of mathematics is something\nbordering on the mysterious…There is no rational explanation for it…The miracle\nof the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of\nthe laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor\ndeserve.\n[2]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nBradley, Dr.  Walter.  Is There Scientific Evidence for the Existence of God?  How\nthe Recent Discoveries Support a Designed Universe.  On-line.  Available from\nInternet, http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9403/evidence.html,\naccessed 10 March 2014.\n[2]\nWigner, Eugene.  1960.  The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the\nPhysical Sciences.\nCommunications on Pure and Applied Mathematics,\nvol. \n13: 1-14.",

    "content": "2.  Fine-Tuning of the Constants\nWhat is a constant? What is meant are\nthe constants of physics.  When the laws of nature are expressed as\nmathematical equations, like the force of gravity, the electromagnetic force,\nand the subatomic ‘weak’ force, you find certain symbols in them that stand for\nnumbers that don’t change.  These unchanging numbers are called ‘constants’\nthat occur in the laws of physics.\nThe laws of nature do not determine the value of these\nconstants.  There could be a universe governed by the\nsame\nlaws, but\nwith\ndifferent\nvalues of these constants.  Therefore, the actual values\nof these constants are\nnot\ndetermined by the laws of nature.  Depending\non the values of those constants, a universe governed by the\nsame\nlaws\nof nature will look very\ndifferent\n.\nThere are at least 20 independent constants and factors\nthat are fine-tuned to a high degree of precision for life to be possible in the\nuniverse.  It is estimated that every year roughly another number is added to\nthe list.\n[1]\nG: Example of a Finely-Tuned Constant\nAn example of a constant is\nthe Gravitational constant – designated by G – which determines the strength of\ngravity via Newton’s Law of Gravity.\nF is the force between two\nmasses\nand\nthat\nare at a distance r apart.  The actual value of G is 6.67 x 10\n-11\nN\n. \nIncrease or decrease G and the force of gravity will correspondingly increase\nor decrease.\nIf one increased the\nstrength of gravity by one part in 10\n34\n, even single-celled\norganisms would be crushed and only planets less than around 100 feet in\ndiameter would sustain life with our brain-size.  Such planets, however, could\nnot sustain an ecosystem to support life of our level of intelligence. In fact\neven a basic ecosystem can barely be possible on such a place.\nIf fact, if G were\nincreased by a mere 64-fold, the gravitational force of the surface of any\nplanet that could retain an atmosphere would be at least 4 times as large.  A\n400-fold increase in G would result in any such planet having a surface force\nat least 10 times as large.  Such a planet would be far less ideal than earth\nfor humans.  On the other hand, a small decrease in G would negatively affect\nthe planet’s hydrologic cycle, this also making any habitable planet less\nideal.\n[2]\n3.  Fine-Tuning of the Initial Conditions of the Universe\nIn addition to the constants, there are certain\narbitrary quantities that are just put in as initial conditions on which the\nlaws of nature operate.  Because these quantities are arbitrary, they are also\nnot\ndetermined by the laws of nature.\nI will first give a simple example to explain what it\nmeans.  When I throw a ball, I throw it at a certain angle and with certain\nspeed.  The angle and speed are the ‘initial conditions.’ After I throw it, the\nball follows a certain course, and where the ball lands will depend on the\n‘initial conditions.’ The course taken by the ball is calculated by using the\nlaw of gravity, which is one of the laws of physics.\nNow, take an example of entropy (thermodynamic disorder)\nin early universe.  It is an ‘initial condition’ in the Big Bang model similar\nto the speed and angle for the ball in the example above.  Just like the\nexample of the ball, after the Big Bang, the laws of physics take over and\ndetermine how the universe will develop from there on.  If the initial entropy\n(an initial condition) of the universe had been different, the laws would\npredict a very different universe.\nHere is the amazing part.  Scientists have discovered\nthat that these constants and initial conditions must fall into an extremely\nnarrow range of values for the universe to exist.  This is what is meant by ‘the\nuniverse has been fine-tuned for life.’\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSpitzer, Robert.  2010.  N\new Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions\nof Contemporary Physics and Philosophy\n.  Grand Rapids/Cambridge: Wm.B.  Eerdmans\nPublishing Co.  50-56.\n[2]\nThe calculations were done and presented by Dr.  Robin Collins, Professor of\nPhilosophy and Chair of the Department of Philosophy at Messiah College, at\nPepperdine University lecture titled ‘\nIs [it] True?\n’ hosted by the\nVeritas Forum on Feb 18, 2013.",

    "content": "1.  Fine-Tuning to Allow a Habitable Planet\nWhen we think of the specific conditions that are needed\nnearer home in our solar system and on earth, we find that there are a host of\nparameters that must be just right in order for life to be possible.  A number\nof factors must be fine-tuned in order to have a planet that supports life:\n·It must be a single star solar system, in\norder to support stable planetary orbits.\n·The sun must have the right mass.  If it was\nlarger, its brightness would change too quickly and there would be too much\nhigh energy radiation.  If it was smaller, the range of planetary distances\nable to support life would be too narrow; the right distance would be so close\nto the star that tidal forces would disrupt the planet’s rotational period.  Ultraviolet\nradiation would also be inadequate for photosynthesis.\n·The distance from the earth to the sun must\nbe just right.  Too near and water would evaporate, too far and the earth would\nbe too cold for life.  A change of only 2% and all life would cease.\n·Earth must have sufficient mass in order to\nretain an atmosphere.\n·Surface gravity and temperature are also\ncritical to within a few percent for the earth to have a life-sustaining\natmosphere – retaining the right mix of gases necessary for life.\n·Earth must rotate at the right speed: too\nslow and temperature differences between day and night would be too extreme,\ntoo fast and wind speeds would be disastrous.\n·The earth’s gravity, axial tilt, rotation\nperiod, magnetic field, crust thickness, oxygen/nitrogen ratio, carbon dioxide,\nwater vapor and ozone levels have to be just right.\nAstrophysicist Hugh Ross\n[2]\nlists many such parameters that have to be fine-tuned for life to be possible,\nand makes a rough but conservative calculation that the chance of one such\nplanet existing in the universe is about 1 in 10\n30\n.\n2.  Fine-Tuning of Carbon ‘Resonance’\nLife requires plenty of carbon that makes complex\nmolecules.  Carbon is formed either by combining three helium nuclei or by\ncombining nuclei of helium and beryllium.  Carbon is like the hub wheel in a\ntinker toy set: you can bind other elements together to more complicated\nmolecules (carbon-based life), but the bonds are not so tight that they can’t\nbe broken down again to make something else.\nEminent mathematician and astronomer Fred Hoyle, found\nthat for this to happen, the nuclear ground state energy levels have to be\nfine-tuned with respect to each other.  This phenomenon is called ‘resonance.’\nThe carbon resonance level is determined by two\nconstants: the ‘strong force’ and ‘electromagnetic force’.  If you mess with\nthese forces even slightly, you either lose the carbon or the oxygen.  If the\nvariation were more than 1% either way, the universe could not sustain life.\nHoyle later confessed that nothing had shaken his\natheism as much as this discovery.\n[3]\n3.  Fine-Tuning of the Strong Nuclear Force\nThe strong force is the force that binds protons and\nneutrons together in nucleus.  If the strong force constant were 2% stronger,\nthere would be no stable hydrogen, no long-lived stars, no hydrogen containing\ncompounds.  This is because the single proton in hydrogen would want to stick\nto something else so badly that there would be no hydrogen left!\nIf the strong force constant were 5% weaker, there would\nbe no stable stars and few elements besides hydrogen.  This is because you\nwould not be able to build up the nuclei of the heavier elements, which contain\nmore than 1 proton.\nSo, whether you adjust the strong force up or down, you\nlose stars that serve as source of energy or you lose complex chemistry which\nis necessary for life.\n4.  Ratio of Strong Nuclear Force to Electromagnetic Force\nIf the ratio of the strong nuclear force to the\nelectromagnetic force had been different by 1 part in 10\n16\n, no stars\ncould have been formed.  Increase it by only 1 part in 10\n40\nand only\nsmall stars can exist, decrease it by the same amount and there will only be\nlarge stars.  You must have both large and small stars in the universe.  The\nlarge ones produce elements in their thermonuclear furnaces and it is only the\nsmall ones that burn long enough to sustain a planet with life.\n[4]\nTo put 10\n40\nin perspective, having a\nprecision of one part in 10\n30\n(a much smaller number) is like firing a bullet and hitting an amoeba at the\nedge of the observable universe!\nArno Penzias, an American physicist and Nobel laureate\nwho co-discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation which helped\nestablish the Big Bang, sums up what he sees,\n‘Astronomy leads us to\na unique event, a universe which was created out of nothing, one with the very\ndelicate balance needed to provide exactly the right conditions required to\npermit life, and one which has an underlying (one might say ‘supernatural’)\nplan.’\n[5]\nFootnotes:\n1.  Ross, Hugh.  2001.\nThe Creator and The Cosmos\n. \nColorado Springs, Co: NavPress.  145-157.\n2.  Bradley, Dr.  Walter.  Is There Scientific Evidence for the Existence of\nGod?

    "featureImage": "",
    "content": "First, physicists identify four fundamental forces of\nnature.  In terms of increasing strength, they are gravity (G\n0\n),\nweak force (10\n31\nG\n0\n), electromagnetic force (10\n37\nG\n0\n), and the strong nuclear force (10\n40\nG\n0\n).\nSecond, since\nextreme\nexamples of fine-tuning\ndeal with extraordinarily large numbers, we need to have an idea of just how\nbig they are.  It will give us some perspective of how delicate fine-tuning is:\n·average number of cells in a human body is 10\n13\n(i.e.  10 trillion)\n·age of the universe is roughly 10\n17\ns\n·number of sub-atomic particles in the known\nuniverse is estimated to be 10\n80\nKeeping these numbers in mind, consider the following\nthree examples of fine-tuning:\n1.  Weak Nuclear Force\nOne of them, the ‘weak nuclear force’ which works inside\nthe nucleus of an atom is so sensitive (finely-tuned) that even an alteration\nof one part in 10\n100\nwould prevent life in the universe!\n[1]\n2.  Cosmological Constant\nThe cosmological constant is a term in Einstein’s theory\nof gravity that has to do with acceleration of the universe’s expansion.  It is\ndescribed as self-stretching property of space (or more accurately space-time).\n[2]\nUnless\nit is within an extremely narrow range around zero, the universe will either\ncollapse or it will expand too rapidly for galaxies and stars to form.  The\nconstant is fine-tuned to an unimaginably precise degree.  If it were changed\nby as little as one part in 10\n120\n, the universe would have no life!\n[3]\n3.  Penrose Number: The\nMost\nExtreme Example of Fine-Tuning\nThat is not it.  According to standard cosmology model,\nthe accepted model of the universe today, if you were to go back some 14\nbillion years, you can think of the universe as condensed to less than the size\nof a golf ball.  The initial state of the space-time, and thus gravity, of the\nearly universe had very low entropy\n[4]\n.  This low entropy is\nrequired for a habitable universe in which high-entropy structures like stars\nare formed.  The ‘mass-energy’ of the initial universe had to be precise to get\ngalaxies, planets, and for us to exist.  The most extreme example of\nfine-tuning has to do with the distribution of mass-energy at that time.\nJust how precise?\nRoger Penrose of Oxford University, and one of Britain’s\nleading theoretical physicists and cosmologists,  has calculated that the odds\nof a low-entropy state to exist by chance alone are one out of 10\n10^123\n- the Penrose number.  He wrote in his book, ‘The Road to Reality,’ Creation\nof the universe, a fanciful description! The Creator’s pin has to find a tiny\nbox, just 1 part in 10\n10^123\nof the entire phase-space volume, in\norder to create a universe with as special a Big Bang as that we actually find.\n[5]\nIn his other book, ‘The Emperor’s New Mind,’ he\nobserved, In order to produce a universe resembling the one in which we live,\nthe Creator would have to aim for an absurdly tiny volume of the phase space of\npossible universes – about 1/10\n10^123\nof the entire volume, for the\nsituation under consideration.\n[6]\nLet us try to get an idea of what type of a number are\nwe talking about?\nYou don’t have enough particles in the universe (that we\nknow of) to write down all the zeroes!  It is like a ten raised to an exponent\nof:\n10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.\nThis number is so large, that if every zero were 10\npoint type, it will fill up a large portion of our universe!\n[7]\nThat is why we will explain it with four illustrations.\nFirst, balancing a billion\npencils all simultaneously positioned upright on their sharpened points on a\nsmooth glass surface with no vertical supports does not even come close to\ndescribing an accuracy of one part in 10\n60\n.\n[8]\nSecond, this is much more\nprecision than would be required to toss a dart and hit a penny across the\nuniverse!\n[9]\nA third illustration\nsuggested by astrophysicist Hugh Ross\n[10]\nmay help.  Cover\nAmerica with coins in a column reaching to the moon (380,000 km or 236,000\nmiles away), then do the same for a billion other continents of the same size. \nPaint one coin red and put it somewhere in one billion of the piles.  Blindfold\na friend and ask her to pick the coin.  The odds of her picking it are 1 in 10\n37\n.\nAll these numbers are extremely small when compared to\nthe precise fine-tuning of the Penrose number, the\nmost extreme\nexample\nof fine-tuning that we know of.\nIn summary, the fine-tuning of many constants of physics\nmust fall into an exceedingly narrow range of values for life to exist.  If\nthey had slightly different values, no complex material systems could exist. \nThis is a widely recognized fact.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nDavies, Paul.  1980.\nOther\nWorlds\n.  London: Dent.  160-61, 168-69.\n[2]\nRoss, Hugh.  2001.\nThe\nCreator and The Cosmos\n.  Colorado Springs, Co: NavPress.  46.\n[3]\nKrauss, Lawrence.  1998.\nThe Astrophysical Journal\n.  501: 465\n[4]\nEntropy is a measure of\ndisorder.\n[5]\nPenrose, Roger.  2004.  The\nRoad to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe.  London: Jonathan\nCape.  730.\n[6]\nPenrose, Roger.  1991.\nThe Emperor’s New Mind:\nConcerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics\n.  New York: Penguin\nBooks.  343.\n[7]\nSpitzer, Robert.  2010.\nNew\nProofs for the Existence of God: Contributions of Contemporary Physics and Philosophy\n. \nGrand Rapids/Cambridge: Wm.B.  Eerdmans Publishing Co.  59.\n[8]\nRoss, Hugh.  2001.\nThe\nCreator and The Cosmos\n.  Colorado Springs, Co: NavPress.  151.\n[9]\nLecture at Pepperdine\nUniversity titled ‘\nIs [it] True?\n’ hosted by the Veritas Forum on Feb 18,\n2013.\n[10]\nRoss, Hugh.  2001.\nThe\nCreator and The Cosmos\n.  Colorado Springs, Co: NavPress.  150.",

    "content": "Three Objections to Fine-Tuning\n[1]\n1.\nSomeone might say, ‘but if the\nconstants and initial values had been different, maybe different forms of life\nmight have evolved.’\nBy ‘life’\nscientists mean the property of organisms to take food, convert it into energy,\ngrow, adapt to their environment, and reproduce.  In order for life to exist,\nconstants and initial conditions have to be fine-tuned otherwise even the\nprecursors of life – planets, galaxies, chemistry – would not exist! Again, the\nquestion is purely speculative.\n2.Another objection might be, ‘what about universes governed by\ndifferent laws of nature that allow radically different forms of life than\nthose in our universe? Maybe constants and initial conditions in those\nuniverses aren’t fine-tuned?’\nThe answer\nto that question is irrelevant to explaining the fine-tuning of\nour\nuniverse.  We do not understand our universe well enough to delve into pure\nspeculation about other universes that we do not know exist.\n3.Someone might object, ‘you cannot change one parameter while\nholding all others constant.  Changing another parameter might compensate for\nthe life-inhibiting effects of a particular parameter change.’\nThe answer\nis that you cannot compensate for changes made to a parameter.\n[2]\nFor\nexample, reducing the weak force can be compensated by reducing the mass\ndifference between the proton and neutron in the early universe.  However,\nchanging a parameter has multiple effects. Reducing the weak force also affects\nthe explosion of massive star supernovae and radioactive decay.\nWhy does Fine-Tuning need an Explanation?\nSomeone might say, ‘the universe just is, why is an\nexplanation needed for fine-tuning?’\n[3]\nIt will be distinctly odd, as Keith Ward comments, ‘to\nthink that there is a reason for everything, except for that most important\nitem of all – that is, the existence of everything, the universe itself.’\n[4]\nImagine a universe-creating machine, like a giant safe\nwith two types of dials.  There are dials that fix the settings for laws of\nphysics like gravity, electromagnetism, and the nuclear forces.  It also has dials\nfor Planck’s constant, one for the ratio of the neutron mass to the proton\nmass, one for the strength of the electromagnetic attraction, and so on.  Initially,\nall dials have been set and fixed at particular numbers.  These numbers are the\nconstants of nature and they produce the universe we live in.\nLet us say that you can change the dials of this\nuniverse generating machine.  There is also a screen which shows you what would\nhappen if you were to change the dials even by a little bit.\nYou change the dials and hit the preview button to see\nwhat might happen.  You weaken the force of electromagnetism and the force of\ngravity just a little.  Then you touch the preview button and see the results\non a screen.  Suddenly, stars, galaxies, and planets start falling apart! Then\nyou increase the dial of the electromagnetic force and suddenly, the planets\nare not the right size.  They are too big for life.  Also, stars burn up\nquickly.\nWhat will you infer about the origin of these finely\ntuned dial settings?\n[5]\nMost people find it hard to believe that a fine-tuned\nuniverse is just a fact that neither has nor requires an explanation.  The\nuniverse just sprang into existence sounds about as scientific as answering the\nquestion why apples fall to the ground, by saying that they just do.\n[6]\nWill anyone accept that a photograph of a face is simply\nthe result of an ink spill? No one would ever accept an accident as an\nexplanation.  If they won’t accept ink spill as an explanation for a\nphotograph, how could anyone accept the universe to be fine-tuned without an\nexplanation?\nFurthermore, fine tuning is a well established\nscientific fact admitted by physicists who are no friends of theism.  Even they\ncannot hide their awe of how finely-tuned our universe is:\nStephen Hawking\n: ‘It\nwould be very difficult to explain why the universe should have begun in just\nthis way, except as the act of a God who intended to create beings like us.’\n[7]\n‘The remarkable fact is\nthat the values of these numbers (i.e.  the constants of physics) seem to have\nbeen very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life.’\n[8]\nSteven Weinberg\n: ‘There\nmay be a cosmological constant in the field equations whose value just cancels\nthe effects of the vacuum mass density produced by quantum fluctuations.  But\nto avoid conflict with astronomical observation, this cancellation would have\nto be accurate to at least 120 decimal places.  Why in the world should the\ncosmological constant be so precisely fine-tuned?’\n[9]\nDr.  Dennis Sciama\n:\nformer director of Cambridge University Observatories, said, ‘If you change a little\nbit the laws of nature…it is very likely that intelligent life would not have\nbeen able to develop.’\n[10]\nMartin Rees\n: ‘The\npossibility of life as we know it depends on the values of a few basic physical\nconstants and is, in some respects remarkably sensitive to their numerical\nvalues.  Nature does not exhibit remarkable coincidences.’\n[11]\nPaul Davies\n: ‘There\nis for me powerful evidence that there is something going on behind it all...It\nseems as though somebody has fine-tuned nature’s numbers to make the Universe...The\nimpression of design is overwhelming.’\n[12]\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nI am\ngrateful to Dr.  William Lane Craig, Dr.  Robin Collins, Dr.  John Lennox, and Dr. \nGuillermo Ganzalez.  Many of these questions and answers were compiled from\ntheir lectures and written works.\n[2]\nS.M.  Barr\nand Almas Khan.  2007.  Anthropic tuning of the weak scale of\nin\ntwo-Higgs-doublet models.  On-line.  Available from Internet,\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0703219v1.pdf\n,\naccessed 14 Mar 2014.\nThe research paper explores two-dimensional tuning:\nwhat happens when you change the size of the up and down quarks simultaneously?\nThey found that 9 distinct effects are produced by the simple change in the masses\nof up and down quarks.  Up and down quarks are fundamental particles of nature\nthat make up protons and neutrons.\n[3]\nBertrand\nRussell wrote, ‘The universe is just there, and that’s all.’\nRussell, Bertrand and Copleston, Frederick.  1964. \nDebate on the Existence of God in\nThe\nExistence of God\n, ed.  John Hick.  New York: Macmillan.  174-75.\nTryton echoed Russell, ‘Our universe is simply one of\nthose things which happen from time to time.’ Tryton, E.  1971.  Is the\nUniverse a Vacuum Fluctuation?\nNature\n246:396.\nCarl Sagan began his bestseller with the words, ‘The\ncosmos is all there is, all there ever was, and all there ever will be.’ (Sagan,\nCarl.  1985.\nCosmos\n.  New York: Ballatine Books.  1.)\n[4]\nop.  cit. \np.  23.\n[5]\nRichards,\nJay.  2008.  Why Are We Here: Accident or Purpose? in\nIntelligent Design\n101: Leading Experts Explain the Key Issues\n, ed., Wayne House, H.  Grand\nRapids: Kregel.  141-142.\n[6]\nLennox,\nJohn C.  2009.\nGod’s Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?\nOxford: Lion. \n64.\n[7]\nHawking,\nStephen.  1998.\nA Brief History of Time\n.  New York: Bantam.  127.\n[8]\nHawking,\nStephen.  1998.\nA Brief History of Time\n.  New York: Bantam.  128.\n[9]\nWeinberg,\nSteven.  1993.  The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the\nUniverse.  New York: Basic Books.  186-187.\n[10]\n‘The\nAnthropic Principle.’ A BBC Special.\n[11]\nMartin\nRees quoted by Ross, Hugh.  2001.\nThe Creator and The Cosmos\n.  Colorado\nSprings, CO: NavPress.  158.\n[12]\nDavies,\nPaul.  1988.  The Cosmic Blueprint: New Discoveries in Nature’s Creative\nAbility To Order the Universe.  New York: Simon and Schuster.  203.",

    "featureImage": "",
    "content": "To many people the evidence of fine-tuning immediately\nsuggests divine creation as the explanation.  Even some atheists, at times,\ncould not resist admitting this commonsense interpretation.  Theoretical\nphysicist and popular science writer Paul Davies wrote, ‘The impression of\ndesign is overwhelming.’\n[1]\nAfter\ndiscovering one of the first cases of fine-tuning, the late astrophysicist,\nFred Hoyle declared, ‘A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that\na superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and\nbiology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature.  The\nnumbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this\nconclusion almost beyond question.’\n[2]\nNevertheless, to exhaust all explanations, first, we\nwill separate two words: fine-tuning and design.  Second, we will apply mutually\nexhaustive causal explanations to eliminate the least likely possibilities to\npick the best one.\nFine-tuning is a neutral term that says nothing how to\nexplain it.  It just means that the range of values of constants and initial\nconditions of the universe at the time of the Big Bang were extremely narrow\nand the physical laws are precisely set. If the values of even one of these\nconstants or initial conditions were changed by the breadth of a hair, there\nwould be no life in the universe today.  The delicate balance required for life\nwould have been upset.\nNext, let us explore all other possible explanations of\nfine-tuning:\nUniverse is Self-Explanatory\nSome say the universe is its own explanation, i.e.  it\nis self-explanatory.\n[3]\nDon’t worry if you don’t understand what it means\nbecause the idea contradicts itself.  It is logically impossible for a cause to\nbring about an effect without being in existence.  John Lennox observes, ‘Attempts\nto argue that the universe is self-explanatory turn out to be as\nself-contradictory as the simple acceptance of a beginning as a brute fact is\nunsatisfactory.’\n[4]\nNecessity\n‘Necessity’ means that the constants and quantities\nmust\nhave the values they do.  But, why does the universe has to permit life? Why do\nthe constants and initial conditions have to be what they are?\nThere are no good answers to these questions, therefore,\nphysical necessity is implausible since there is\nno\nevidence that\nlife-permitting universes are necessary.\nAs a matter of fact, life-prohibiting universes are more\nlikely\nthan a life-permitting universe.  As Paul Davies wrote, It\nseems, then, that the physical universe does not have to be the way it is: it\ncould have been otherwise.\n[5]\nUniverse Was Either Created by Physical Laws or Was\nSelf-Generated\nIf a cake cannot generate itself, how can a universe\ngenerate itself? It is hard to believe, but some atheists suggest that the\nuniverse was brought into existence by a theory, or laws of physics, or\nmathematics.\n[6]\nFirst, ascribing intelligence to mathematical laws and\nbelieving they could be intelligent is non-sense.\nSecond, explanations of physical phenomenon like the\nrising of the sun from the East with laws of physics are descriptive and\npredictive, but not creative.  Who created these laws? Newton’s law of\ngravitation does\nnot\ncreate gravity or\ncause\nanything to happen. \nReplace the universe with a jet engine.  Will we say someone made it for a\nspecific purpose or shall we dismiss the agent who made it and say the jet\nengine arose naturally from the physical laws? This will be absurd.  God does\nnot compete or conflict with the laws of physics as an explanation.  Laws of\nphysics can explain how the jet engine works, but not how it came about in the\nfirst place.\n[7]\nLennox\nput it well in one of his lectures, ‘nonsense remains nonsense even if talked\nby famous scientists.’\nChance or Brute Force?\nCould the fine-tuning be due to chance?  Could it be an\naccident that all constants and initial conditions just fell into the range\nthat allows life? The problem is that the chances of a life-permitting universe\nto exist are so\nremote\nthat this alternative becomes unreasonable.  No\nrespectable physicist (including atheists), believes that fine-tuning can be\nexplained by pure chance.\nSomeone might ask, when does something become so\nimprobable that it becomes impossible? Williams Dembski, a mathematician,\nattempted to answer the question in his book,\nThe Design Inference\n.  You\nconsider the number of particles in the universe\nand\nyou also consider\nthe number of seconds in the universe, which he places at 10\n25\n.  Then\nhe multiplies this by 10\n45\nas the number of events, or reactions,\nthat could take place per second.  On this basis, he arrives at a probability\nwhich is one half times one out of 10\n150\n.  Anything that falls\nbeyond that probability bound, he says, is not different from impossibility.\nFurthermore, the objection is answered with an\nillustration given by John Leslie.\n[8]\nLet\nus say you are dragged in front of a firing squad of 100 trained shooters\nstanding at point-blank.  You hear ‘Ready!  Aim! Fire!’  You then hear the\nsound of guns, but, amazingly, you are still alive!  Did all the 100 shooters\nmiss? What conclusion will you reach?\nWould you say, ‘guess I shouldn’t be surprised they all\nmissed! After all, had they not missed, I would not be here! There is nothing\nmore to explain!’\nNo person in their right mind will accept this\nexplanation.  In light of the enormous improbability that\nall\nshooters\nmissed, a\nreasonable\nconclusion will be they all missed on\npurpose\n.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nDavies, Paul.  1988.  The Cosmic Blueprint: New Discoveries in Nature’s\nCreative Ability To Order the Universe.  New York: Simon and Schuster.  203.\n[2]\nHoyle, Fred.  1982.  The Universe: Past and Present Reflections.\nAnnual\nReview of Astronomy and Astrophysics\n: 20:16.\n[3]\nAtkins, Peter\n. \n1994\n.\nCreation Revisited\n.  Harmondsworth: Penguin.  143.\n[4]\nLennox, John C.  2009.\nGod’s Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?\nOxford: Lion.  69.\n[5]\nDavies, Paul.  2005.\nThe Mind of God\n.  New York: Simon & Schuster. \n169.\n[6]\n‘The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot\nanswer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to\ndescribe.  Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?

    "content": "First, it is important to know what naturalism\nis.  Naturalism is the\nbelief\nthat only natural explanations (as opposed\nto\nsuper\nnatural ones) should be considered.  Because a designer/Creator\nis\nsuper\nnatural and beyond nature, naturalism rules out this\nexplanation,\nregardless\nof evidence.\nTherefore, due to the fact that\nno\nnatural\nexplanation has been found for fine-tuning, some physicists make recourse to a\nmultiverse (multiple universes) - a naturalistic explanation.\nThe idea is that if there exists a vast multiverse, the probabilistic\nresources available to account for our finely-tuned universe by chance are\nincreased.  Therefore, many atheist scientists have come to the conclusion that\nfine-tuning\nneeds\nexplanation\nunless\nmany worlds are assumed.\nAccording to this idea, there are an enormous number of\nuniverses with different initial conditions, values of constants, and even laws\nof physics.  Our universe is just one member of this ‘multiverse’ out of\n(probably) an infinite random universes.  If all these other worlds really\nexist, then, by chance, life-permitting universes will have observers in them\nand they will observe their world to be finely-tuned.\nTherefore, there is no need to say our universe was fine-tuned\nfor life, that is, the laws, constants, and initial conditions were precisely\nset to allow life.\nThus, simply by chance, some universe will have the\n‘winning combination’ for life.  It is just like you produce lottery tickets.  Even\nif it is 1 in a 10 million chance, the winning ticket will eventually come up. \nAccording to this idea, human beings are winners of a ‘cosmic lottery.’ When it\ncomes up, humans evolve and look back and say, ‘we were lucky!’\nSome Observations on Multiple Universes (Multiverse\nHypothesis)\nFirst consideration\n:\nThere is no shred of evidence to prove the existence of these multiple\nuniverses.  As a matter of principle, we cannot even observe them.\n[1]\nThat is\nwhy the idea has been severely criticized by leading scientists:\nJohn Polkinghorne\nof\nCambridge, a former professor of mathematical physics, has called the idea\npseudo-science and a metaphysical guess.\n[2]\nIn another place, he had\nthis to say, ’The many universes account is sometimes presented as if it were\npurely scientific, but in fact a sufficient portfolio of different universes\ncould only be generated by speculative processes that go well beyond what sober\nscience can honestly endorse.\n[3]\nArno Penzias\n, an\nAmerican physicist and Nobel prize winner who co-discovered the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation which helped establish the Big Bang theory, put\nthe argument this way, ‘Some people are uncomfortable with the purposefully\ncreated world.  To come up with things that contradict purpose, they tend to\nspeculate about things they haven’t seen.’\n[4]\nMartin Rees\nis a\nBritish cosmologist and astrophysicist from Cambridge and past President of the\nRoyal Society.  In a 2000 interview with a science journalist, he admitted the\ncalculations are highly arbitrary, and that the theory itself hangs on\nassumptions, remains speculative, and is not amenable to direct investigation. \n’The other universes are unavailable to us, just as the interior of a black\nhole is unavailable,’ he said.  He added that we cannot even know if the\nuniverses are finite or infinite in number.\n[5]\nRichard Swisburne\n, a\nleading philosopher, comments, ‘To postulate a trillion-trillion other\nuniverses, rather than one God, in order to explain the orderliness of our\nuniverse, seems the height of irrationality.’\n[6]\nSecond consideration\n:\nit violates the principle of Ockham’s Razor which states that the most\nplausible explanation is one with the least number of assumptions and\nconditions.\n[7]\nThird consideration\n:\nAll known multiverse\ntheories\nactually have significant fine-tuning\nrequirements.  Consequently, the fine-tuning of a multiverse will\nneed\nan explanation.  In order to be credible, a plausible mechanism must be\nsuggested for the many worlds.  Where did the multiverse generator come from?\nA ‘multiverse generator’ will require ‘design.’ It would need to be ‘well\nbuilt’ with just the right laws and have the right ingredients (initial\nconditions) to function and produce life sustaining universes.  For example, examining\nthe inflationary superstring multiverse, it requires at least five special mechanisms\nor laws.  Who or ‘what’ designed this hypothetical generator remains unanswered.\nTherefore, the universe\ngenerator hypothesis does not undercut the fine-tuning argument; instead it\nkicks the issue of fine-tuning up one level.\nForth consideration\n:\nSince, a multiverse cannot be observed, how can anyone know that the other\nworlds are less ordered and more chaotic and fruitless than ours?  If the only\nworld we know and we can use as clue for the structure of others is the one we\nlive in, and it is fine-tuned, then by analogy the other worlds must have been\nat least as well designed as this one.  That would require even a\nmore\npowerful\nCreator.\n[8]\nFifth consideration\n:\nEven though at the present time there is\nno\nscientific evidence that a\nmultiverse exists, there does not seem a need to deny it’s possibility.\n[9]\nJust like\nthere are many dead planets in our universe, maybe, just maybe, there are many\ndead universes as well.  Interestingly, there is actually an important theorem\n[10]\nwhich\nstates that even if a multiverse that generated our universe existed, it\nmust\nhave a beginning!  Consequently, it will best be explained by the design of a\npowerful Creator, not chance.\nTo sum it up, multiverse\nhypothesis is purely speculative.  Even if it turns out to have any scientific\nmerit, it is fully compatible with belief in God.\nUniverse or multiverse,\nfine-tuning wins.   Heads or tails, Creator wins.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\n1.  Originally the many-worlds hypothesis was proposed for strictly scientific\nreasons as a solution to the so-called quantum measurement problem in physics. \nThough its efficacy as an explanation within quantum physics remains\ncontroversial among physicists, its use there does have an empirical basis.  More\nrecently, however, it has been employed to serve as an alternate non-theistic\nexplanation for the fine-tuning of the physical constants.  This use of the\n[hypothesis] does seem to betray a metaphysical desperation.

Science is limited by its nature and thus cannot\nprovide definite answers. 3. Similar reflections from ancient camel\nriders to modern-day thinkers tell us that the ‘evidence’ for God is equally\naccessible to everyone.",
    "featureImage": "",
    "content": "1.    After exhausting all possible mutually\nexhaustive causative explanations, fine-tuning of our universe is\nbest\nexplained to be the design of an immensely knowledgeable and powerful\nCreator. Divine creation,\nnot\nchance, is the\nmost compelling\nand\nreasonable\nexplanation for the fine-tuning of the universe.\n2.    Multiverse hypothesis is highly speculative,\nbut even if true, it would\nnot\nconflict with belief in God.\n3.    The reason that evidence from fine-tuning is\nextremely compelling and reasonable, but\nnot\ndefinitive is that science\nis\nlimited\nby it’s nature. To be more precise, all scientific endeavor\nis limited\nby definition\n. Obviously, what we can learn from science will\nalso be limited at a certain level. To understand this statement, we need to\nknow that there are two generally accepted, major types of reasoning: induction\nand deduction.\nScience\nis based on\ninduction\n,\nmathematics\nis based on\ndeduction\n.\n[1]\nBy definition\n, inductive reasoning is\nuncertain\n. The well known\n‘problem of induction’ led the thinker Charlie Broad to say, ’induction is the\nglory of science and the scandal of philosophy.’\n[2]\nThus, science cannot\ndeductively\nprove\nGod because science is an\nempirical endeavor based on\ninduction\n. Furthermore, science by itself\ncannot\nbe certain that it has considered all possible data for a complete explanation\nof a particular phenomena, let alone the universe itself.\nBut, science\ndoes\nenable us to identify the exceedingly\nhigh\nimprobability\nof a\nrandom occurrence required for life to exist in the universe.\n4.    That is why when we describe fine-tuning\nevidence as\ncompelling\n, we don’t mean that\neveryone\nwill be\nconvinced by our explanation of every bit of evidence, or that we have made\nsuch a definitive and irrefutable case for the evidence that no one will be\nable to resist the conclusions. The evidence is compelling in and of itself,\nbut our articulation of that evidence will only be as good as our grasp of it.\nOn the other hand, if\nsomeone does\nnot\nwant to believe in God, no amount of evidence can force\nsuch a person to accept God’s existence as fact.\n5.    Finally, we need\nnot\ndepend on\nscience, complex logic, or a high level of education to ‘see’ the evidence for\nthe Creator. The creation points to its Creator. This knowledge has always been\navailable to human beings regardless of their level of education. After all, an\nilliterate man has as much right to know God as modern-day scientists and\nphilosophers. To think otherwise, is the height of arrogance.\nFollowing are reflections of an Arabic poet, and\nconclusions of a modern-day theologian and some notable physicists. They show\nthat knowledge of God’s existence has been equally and easily accessible to\nthose who choose to ‘see’ God in their immediate environments:\nArabic poet, ‘Camel dung indicates the presence of a\ncamel and footsteps indicate that someone walked here.

    "content": "What is Fine Tuning?\nOver the past century, scientists have\ndiscovered that if certain properties of the universe were changed very\nslightly from what they are, we would not be here.  They have to be within a\nvery narrow range for our universe to make life possible and be habitable.\nThe universe is fine-tuned for the existence of\nintelligent life with a complexity and delicacy that literally defy human\ncomprehension.\nTypes of Fine-Tuning\n1.Fine tuning of the laws of nature.\n2.Fine-tuning of the constants of physics.\n3.Fine tuning of the initial conditions of the universe.\n1. Fine tuning of the laws of nature\nThere are two ways to look at this aspect of\nfine-tuning:\nA.   Precisely the right laws are needed for highly\ncomplex life to exist.  If one of these were missing, such life would not be\npossible.  An example is the the law of gravity.  Without it, there won’t be\nany stars or planets.  Another example is the electromagnetic force without\nwhich there would be no atoms because there would be no force to hold the\nnegatively charged electrons with the positively charged protons that allow for\nchemical bonds.\nB.   Harmony between nature and mathematics: Only\nin the 20th century have we come to understand that what we observe in nature can\nbe described by only a few physical laws, each of which is described by simple\nmathematical equations.\n2. Fine-Tuning of the Constants\nThe ‘constants’ are the unchanging numbers that appear\nin the mathematical equations that express the laws of nature.  The laws of\nnature do not determine the value of these constants.  There could be a\nuniverse governed by the\nsame\nlaws, but with\ndifferent\nvalues of\nthese constants.  Depending on the values of those constants, a universe\ngoverned by the\nsame\nlaws of nature will look very\ndifferent\n.  An\nexample is G, the Gravitational Constant.  If one increased the strength of\ngravity by one part in 10\n34\n, even single-celled organisms would be\ncrushed, and only planets less than around 100 feet in diameter would sustain\nlife with our brain-size.  A 400-fold measure in G would result in any such\nplanet having a surface force at least 10 times as large.  Such a planet would\nbe far less ideal than earth for humans.\n3. Fine-Tuning of the Initial Conditions of the Universe\nIn addition to the constants, there are certain\narbitrary quantities that are just put in as initial conditions on which the\nlaws of nature operate.  Because these quantities are arbitrary, they are also\nnot\ndetermined by the laws of nature.\nScientists have discovered that that these constants and\ninitial conditions must fall into an extremely narrow range of values for the\nuniverse to exist.  This is what is meant by ‘the universe has been fine tuned\nfor life.’\nAn Example of Fine Tuning\nThis is an example of fine-tuning that allows a habitable\nplanet.   A number of factors must be fine-tuned in order to have a planet that\nsupports life:\n·It must be a single star solar system, in\norder to support stable planetary orbits.\n·The sun must have the right mass.  If it was\nlarger, its brightness would change too quickly and there would be too much\nhigh energy radiation.  If it was smaller, the range of planetary distances\nable to support life would be too narrow; the right distance would be so close\nto the star that tidal forces would disrupt the planet’s rotational period.  Ultraviolet\nradiation would also be inadequate for photosynthesis.\n·The distance from the earth to the sun must\nbe just right.  Too near and water would evaporate, too far and the earth would\nbe too cold for life.  A change of only 2% and all life would cease.\n·Earth must have sufficient mass in order to\nretain an atmosphere.\n·Surface gravity and temperature are also\ncritical to within a few percent for the earth to have a life-sustaining\natmosphere – retaining the right mix of gases necessary for life.\n·Earth must rotate at the right speed: too\nslow and temperature differences between day and night would be too extreme,\ntoo fast and wind speeds would be disastrous.\n·The earth’s gravity, axial tilt, rotation\nperiod, magnetic field, crust thickness, oxygen/nitrogen ratio, carbon dioxide,\nwater vapor and ozone levels have to be just right.\nA rough but conservative calculation of the chance that\nsuch a planet exists in the universe is about 1 in 10\n30\n.\nThe\nMost\nExtreme Example of Fine Tuning\nAccording to standard cosmology model, the initial state\nof the space-time, and thus gravity, of the early universe had very low entropy\n[1]\n.  The\n‘mass-energy’ of the initial universe had to be precise to get galaxies,\nplanets, and for us to exist.  The most extreme example of fine-tuning has to\ndo with the distribution of mass-energy at that time.\nJust how precise?\nThe odds of a low-entropy state to exist by chance alone\nare one out of 10\n10^123\n- the Penrose number.  Let us try to get an\nidea of what type of a number are we talking about? You don’t have enough\nparticles in the universe (that we know of) to write down all the zeroes!  This\nnumber is so large, that if every zero were 10 point type, it will fill up a\nlarge portion of our universe! That is why we will explain it with three illustrations:\nFirst, balancing a billion pencils all simultaneously\npositioned upright on their sharpened points on a smooth glass surface with no\nvertical supports does not even come close to describing an accuracy of one\npart in 10\n60\n.\nSecond, this is much more precision than would be\nrequired to toss a dart and hit a penny across the universe!\nThird, cover America with coins in a column reaching to\nthe moon (380,000 km or 236,000 miles away), then do the same for a billion\nother continents of the same size.  Paint one coin red and put it somewhere in\none billion of the piles.  Blindfold a friend and ask her to pick the coin.  The\nodds of her picking it are 1 in 10\n37\n.\nAll these numbers are extremely\nsmall\nwhen\ncompared to the precise fine-tuning of the Penrose number, the\nmost extreme\nexample of fine-tuning that we know of.\nIn summary, the fine-tuning of many constants of physics\nmust fall into an exceedingly narrow range of values for life to exist.  If\nthey had slightly different values, no complex material systems could exist.  This\nis a widely recognized fact.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nEntropy is a measure of disorder.",

    "content": "Does fine-tuning need an explanation?\nSomeone might say, ‘the universe just is, why\nis an explanation needed for fine-tuning?’\nImagine a universe-creating machine, like a giant safe\nwith two types of dials.  There are dials that fix the settings for laws of\nphysics, the constants, and the initial conditions, like gravity, electromagnetism,\nand the nuclear forces.  Initially, all dials have been set and fixed at\nparticular numbers.  These numbers are the constants of nature and they produce\nthe universe we live in.\nLet us say that you can change the dials of this\nuniverse generating machine.  There is also a screen which shows you what would\nhappen if you were to change the dials even by a little bit.\nYou change the dials and hit the preview button to see\nwhat might happen.  You weaken the force of electromagnetism and the force of\ngravity just a little.  Then you touch the preview button and see the results\non a screen.  Suddenly, stars, galaxies, and planets start falling apart! Then\nyou increase the dial of the electromagnetic force and suddenly, the planets\nare not the right size.  They are too big for life.  Also, stars burn up\nquickly.\nWhat will you infer about the origin of these\nfinely tuned dial settings? Could it be there by chance or did someone set it\nup by design for a purpose?\nWhat is the most\nreasonable\nexplanation of\nfine-tuning?\nTo many fine-tuning implies design, but the two are\nseparate ideas. Therefore, we will discuss all\npossible\nexplanations for\nfine-tuning and see that divine creation is the only\nreasonable\nchoice:\nUniverse is Self-Explanatory\nSome say the universe is its own explanation, i.e.  it\nis self-explanatory.\nDon’t worry if you don’t understand what it means\nbecause the idea contradicts itself.  It is logically impossible for a cause to\nbring about an effect without being in existence.\nNecessity\n‘Necessity’ means that the constants and quantities\nmust\nhave the values they do.  But, why does the universe has to permit life? Why do\nthe constants and initial conditions have to be what they are?\nThere are no good answers to these questions; therefore,\nphysical necessity is implausible since there is\nno\nevidence that\nlife-permitting universes are necessary.\nUniverse Was Either Created by Physical Laws or Was\nSelf-Generated\nIf a cake cannot generate itself, how can a universe\ngenerate itself? It is hard to believe, but some atheists suggest that the\nuniverse was brought into existence by a theory, or laws of physics, or\nmathematics.\nFirst, ascribing intelligence to mathematical laws and\nbelieving they could be intelligent is non-sense.\nSecond, explanations of physical phenomenon like the\nrising of the sun from the East with laws of physics are descriptive and\npredictive, but not creative.  Who created these laws? Replace the universe\nwith a jet engine.  Laws of physics can explain how a jet engine works, but not\nhow it came about in the first place.\nChance or Brute Force?\nCould the fine-tuning be due to chance? Could it be an\naccident that all constants and initial conditions just fell into the range\nthat allows life? The problem is that the chances of a life-permitting universe\nto exist are so\nremote\nthat this alternative becomes unreasonable.  No\nrespectable physicist (including atheists), believes that fine-tuning can be\nexplained by pure chance.\nLet us say you are dragged in front of a firing squad of\n100 trained shooters standing at point-blank.  You hear ‘Ready! Aim! Fire!’ You\nthen hear the sound of guns, but, amazingly, you are still alive! Did all the\n100 shooters miss? What conclusion will you reach?\nWould you say, ‘guess I shouldn’t be surprised they all\nmissed! After all, had they not missed, I would not be here! There is nothing\nmore to explain!’\nNo person in their right mind will accept this\nexplanation.  In light of the enormous improbability that\nall\nshooters\nmissed, a\nreasonable\nconclusion will be they all missed on\npurpose\n.\nWhat about Multiverse Hypothesis?\nFirst, it is important to know what is naturalism.  Naturalism\nis the\nbelief\nthat only natural explanations (as opposed to\nsuper\nnatural\nones) should be considered.  Since a Designer/Creator would be considered\nsuper\nnatural,\nnaturalism would rule out this explanation,\nregardless\nof the evidence.\nTherefore, due to the fact that\nno\nnatural\nexplanation has been found for fine-tuning, some physicists make recourse to a\nmultiverse (multiple universes) - a naturalistic explanation.\nAccording to this idea, there are an enormous number of\nuniverses with different initial conditions, values of constants, and even laws\nof physics.  Our universe is just one member of this ‘multiverse’ out of an\ninfinite random universes.  If all these other worlds really exist, then, by\nchance, life-permitting universes will have observers in them and they will\nobserve their world to be finely tuned.  Therefore, there is no need to say our\nuniverse was fine tuned for life, simply by chance, some universe will have the\n‘winning combination’ for life.  It is just like you produce lottery tickets.  Even\nif it is 1 in a 10 million chance, the winning ticket will eventually come up. \nAccording to this idea, human beings are winners of a ‘cosmic lottery.’ When it\ncomes up, humans evolve and look back and say, ‘we were lucky!’\nFirst\nconsideration\n: There is no shred of evidence to prove the existence of\nthese multiple universes.  As a matter of principle, we\ncannot\neven\nobserve them.  That is why the idea has been severely criticized by leading\nscientists.\nSecond\nconsideration\n: it violates the principle of Ockham’s Razor which states\nthat the most plausible explanation is one with the least number of assumptions\nand conditions.\nThird\nconsideration\n:\nAll known multiverse\ntheories\nactually have\nsignificant fine-tuning requirements.  Consequently, the fine-tuning of a multiverse\nwill\nneed\nan explanation.\nForth\nconsideration\n: Since, a multiverse cannot be observed, how can anyone\nknow that the other worlds are less ordered and more chaotic and fruitless than\nours?\nFifth\nconsideration\n: Even though at the present time there is\nno\nscientific evidence that a multiverse exists, there does not seem a need to\ndeny it’s possibility.  Interestingly, there is actually an important theorem\nwhich states that even if a multiverse that generated our universe existed, it\nmust\nhave a beginning! Consequently, it will best be explained by the design of a\npowerful Creator, not chance.\nTo sum it up, multiverse hypothesis is purely\nspeculative.  Even if it turns out to have any scientific merit, it is fully\ncompatible with belief in God.\nConclusion\nAfter exhausting all\npossible\nmutually exhaustive\ncausative explanations, fine-tuning of our universe is\nbest\nexplained to\nbe the design of an immensely knowledgeable and powerful Creator.  Divine\ncreation,\nnot\nchance, is the\nmost compelling\nand\nreasonable\nexplanation for the fine-tuning of the universe.\nUniverse or multiverse, fine-tuning wins.  Heads or\ntails, Creator wins.",

    "content": "Everything\nin our limited experience must have a beginning and end.  We ourselves are born\nand we ultimately die.  This is the case with our parents and forefathers as\nwell as with our children and descendants.  Such relationships permeate\ncreation.\nSome people, due to intellectual weakness or simplicity,\nassume that everything must be comparable to their own past experience.  They\nrely on the imagination, which is really only capable of visualizing that which\nhas in one way or another already been experienced.  This is why the\nimagination is incapable of grappling with absolutes and with universal\nconcepts.\nProphet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be\nupon him, was referring to the limits of human reason when he said:\nPeople will keep asking questions until they come\nto asking: ‘God created the universe, but who created God?’ Whoever has\nthoughts like this should simply declare: ‘I believe in God.’ Seek God’s help\nand desist from such thoughts.\n[1]\nThe human mind has limitations, and our human\nperspective is deficient.  Because of this, some people fall into misgivings\nwith respect to God’s pre-existence.  We need to realize that we are dealing\nhere with a matter of faith; in other words, a matter which transcends the\nlimitations of human reason.\nAfter making the statement quoted above, it is mentioned\nthat Prophet Muhammad advised reciting the chapter of the Qur’an entitled Purity\nof Faith (Chapter al-Ikhlas):\nSay: He is Allah (God), the One.  Allah (God), the\nSelf-Subsisting.  He begets not, nor is He begotten, and there is none like\nunto Him. (Quran 112:1-4)\nThe crucial verse here is He begets not, nor is He\nbegotten.  It shows that God’s perfection and Self-Subsistence defy human\nexperience and transcend the limits of the human imagination.\nSo God says:\nAllah (God), the Self-Subsisting.  He\nbegets not, nor is He begotten\nand immediately follows it with:\nand\nthere is none like unto Him.\nWe cannot compare God with anything in our\nexperience.  Likewise, we find that God commands us:\nDo not give likenesses\nto God.\n(Quran 16:74) This is the way our faith in God should be.\nProphet Muhammad advised those who were plagued with\ndoubts like Who created God? to: Seek God’s help and desist from such\nthoughts. Nothing can be gained from pursuing the line of thinking as to Who\ncreated God? God’s nature cannot be compared to created existence, nor can it\nbe compassed by the limitations of human reason.  The human mind, however, can\nconceive of God’s existence and acknowledge that He is the Creator of all\nthings.  In fact, the human mind resists any attempt to compel it to deny God’s\nexistence.\nCommunist regimes of the 20th century tried to compel\ntheir subjects to embrace atheism.  They employed every forceful means at their\ndisposal, but the people refused to deny God.  They resisted the most\nauthoritarian attempts to crush their belief in God’s existence.\nThe human mind acknowledges the existence of a Creator. \nReason cannot escape from such an acknowledgment.  The mind, consequently\nbrings us to seek guidance about God and gives us a natural inclination to\nworship Him.  We are receptive to God’s Messengers, and God would not leave His\ncreatures without guiding them to the wisdom as to why they were created.  Indeed,\nGod says:\nI have only created humanity and the Jinn to worship Me. (Quran\n51:56)\nThe intellect certainly recognizes God, but it is not\ncapable of comprehending all of His attributes.  The role of God’s Prophets and\nMessengers is to teach people what they need to know about their Lord and how God\nwishes them to worship Him.  This protects people from concocting all sorts of\nrituals and rites from their own imaginings that have no basis in revelation\nfrom God.\nProphet Muhammad said, addressing God in supplication: You\nare the First, so nothing precedes You.  You are the Last, so nothing comes\nafter You.  You are the Manifest, so nothing comes above You.  You are the\nHidden, so nothing comes below you.  Fulfill our debts for us and enrich us so\nwe will not be poor.\n[2]\nGod is the First who is not preceded by anything else.  This\nis a concept that cannot be fully grasped by the imagination, but it can\ncertainly be accepted by the mind and heart.  Our awareness of the limitations\nthat our minds have is a crucial awareness.\nLikewise, God is the Last, whose existence persists\nwithout end.  As such, God is truly the Inheritor:\nAnd remember Zechariah,\nwhen he cried unto his Lord: ‘My Lord! Leave me not childless, though You are\nthe Best of inheritors.’ (Quran 21:89)\nGod is timeless and eternal, without beginning or end.  By\ncontrast, all created things have a beginning and end.\nGod says about the Sun:\nAnd the Sun runs its course\nto a point determined.\n(Quran 36:38) The Sun and other celestial bodies\nare far older than the living things on Earth.  But just like the fleeting\nlives of terrestrial beings, the stars are born and they die.  All things in\nthe universe must come to an end.\nGod cannot be understood according to the terms of\nmaterial existence.  He is not bound by the laws of physics which are\nthemselves part of the nature of what He created.  It is no surprise that the\nmind cannot fully grasp the Creator, since the mind is itself created and\nsubject to the limitations of its created nature.  The mind can only fall into\nconfusion and self-deception if it tries to rationalize that which is beyond\nits powers.\nRather, we should apply our mental efforts to matters\nour minds are capable of engaging with – the universe that God created and the\nvast horizons of knowledge that it presents.  God has given us the rational\nability and the imaginative power to uncover and conceptualize the physical\nlaws of nature.  We can harness such knowledge to benefit humanity in ways that\nplease God.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nSahih Muslim\n[2]\nSahih Muslim",

    "content": "What’s the difference between evolutionary theory and an octopus?\nWell, one is a slippery, color-changing escape artist that can get out of any\ntough situation and the other is an aquatic invertebrate.\nBut seriously.  One of the biggest problems for\nneo-Darwinists is the origin of complex structures that appear suddenly in\nnature or the fossil record.  My friend\nDr.  Stephen Meyer talks about this in his wonderful book, Darwin’s\nDoubt.\nHe points out how, in the so-called Cambrian Explosion, the\nmajority of animal phyla on earth appeared suddenly, and without obvious\nancestry—almost as if they exploded onto the scene out of nowhere.\nBut for evolutionary biologists who adhere to strict\nnaturalism,\nliving\nanimals pose an even greater problem:\nThings like powered flight, the so-called camera eye, and advanced brains\ndefy reduction.  That is, they’re so complex that you can’t make them simpler\nwithout breaking them.  Yet scientists tell us that many of these structures\narose by themselves not once, but many times! And here is where the octopus\ncomes in.\nA study published in the journal Nature\ndescribes\nhow researchers sequenced the octopus genome and found something surprising.  Compared\nwith other invertebrates, the DNA of the octopus was alien: nothing like the\ngenetic codes of what they thought were similar animals, like clams and sea\nsnails.\nNow, octopi aren’t from another planet, but they are,\nfiguratively speaking, out-of-this-world.  They can change color and texture,\nthey use ink to make a quick getaway, and they’re shockingly clever.  They\ncan\nunscrew\njar lids\nand squeeze their soft bodies\nthrough just\nabout any opening\n.\nOne nineteenth century\nnaturalist tells of an octopus\nclimbing out of its tank, ambling across the room to a neighboring tank, and\ngorging itself on fish before returning home!\nThe key to this uncanny intelligence is the octopus’\nso-called alien nervous system, brain, and eyes.  But these features are not\nalien to the animal kingdom at all.  In fact, they’re quite common in higher\nvertebrates.  The octopus genome shares key similarities with ours, including\nthe development of high-powered brains and\ncamera\neyes with a cornea, lens, and retina\n.\nNow here’s the problem for evolution: according to\nNeo-Darwinists, we’re not related to octopi—at least not within the last\nseveral hundred million years.  That means all of these genes, complex\nstructures, and incredible capabilities came about\ntwice\n.\nThe researchers who sequenced the octopus genome call\nthis a striking example of convergent evolution, or the supposed tendency\nof\nunrelated\ncreatures to develop the\nsame\ntraits\nin response to environmental pressures.  Isn’t that just a fancy way of saying\na miracle happened twice?\nBut the octopus isn’t the only such miracle.  Convergent\nevolution is all over nature, from powered flight evolving three times\nto\neach continent having its own version of the anteater\n.  Think\nabout that.  As\none delightfully un-self-conscious Science Today cover\nput\nit, convergent evolution is nature discover[ing] the same design over and\nover. Well, good for nature!\nBut as Luskin argues, there’s a better explanation for a\ntentacled mollusk having a mammal’s brain and human eyes.  And that explanation\nis common design by an intelligent Engineer.  And like all good engineers, this\nthis one reused some of His best designs.\nNow that explanation isn’t going to satisfy Darwinian\nnaturalists.  And they’ll probably keep on invoking convergent evolution when\nfaced with impossible coincidences in nature.\nBut hopefully knowing a more straightforward explanation\nleaves you forearmed—or should I said eight-armed?",

    "content": "Religion, or faith, is often considered to be directly\nopposed to reason.  Many people see reason and religion as completely different\nconcepts.  Faith is usually defined as confidence or trust in a person or\nthing, not necessarily based on proof, while reason is described as sound\njudgement, good sense, and the ability to think a problem through logically.  However,\nwe need to look beyond these basic definitions because only then will we\ndiscover that Islam considers the faculty of reason to be a fundamental and\nnecessary part of faith.\nThe first verses of the Quran revealed to Prophet\nMuhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, urged him to read,\nthus establishing a link to literacy, and throughout the Quran the reader is\nconstantly advised to think.\nRead! In the name of your Lord who has created all that\nexists. (Quran 96:1)\nIt is a Book We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so\nlet people of intelligence ponder its verses and take heed. (Quran 38:29)\n…such are the parables that we put forward to humankind so\nthat they may reflect. (Quran 59:21)\nBeing able to use our reason, and come to logical\nconclusions is a God-given blessing, and in addition to this, thinking,\nreasoning and contemplation are essential parts of faith.   Thus, a person is\nreminded to use rational thought processes to come to logical conclusions.  Without\nknowledge and understanding a person may not recognize God or worship Him in\nirrational or forbidden ways.\nIrrationality could be described as one of the\ncharacteristics of unbelief, idolatry, or hypocrisy.  Lack of reason hinders a\nperson’s ability to recognize the truth, and the value of religion.\nThey will say: If only we had been listening or reasoning, we\nwould not be among the dwellers of the blazing Fire. (Quran 67:10)\n…Their violence among themselves is severe.  You imagine they\nare united, but their hearts are divided.  That is because they are people who\ndo not understand. (Quran 59:14)\nThe fundamentals of Islam are in complete harmony with\nsound reason.  Islam is not a blind faith.  A non-Muslim is not expected to believe\nwithout proof, rather they can look at the proofs Islam offers, use critical\nthinking and take an informed decision.  Rational thought and logic are\nessential for understanding God and His relationship to us and the world.   Even\nfor a Muslim, indulging in illogical or irrational thinking could quite\npossibly lead to sin and destruction.\nThe power of rational thought, reasoning teaches us that\nhumankind has inherent limitations.  Thus, there are many things that we cannot\nintellectually grasp.  There are things that God refers to as the unseen,\nthings that we must take as truths simply because God has informed us about\nthem.  However, it is also reasoning that allows us to know with certainty that\nGod created the world and has subjected it and all who dwell in it to universal\nlaws, His Laws.\nVerily, in the creation of the heavens and earth, and the\nalternation of the night and the day, and the ships which sail through the sea\nwith benefits for people, and what God has sent down from the heavens of rain,\ngiving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein\nevery creature, and in His directing of the winds and the clouds controlled\nbetween the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who use reason. (Quran\n2:164)\nAnd it is through reasoning we conclude that if we are\nconvinced that Islam is the true religion of God based on its fundamental\nteachings and the proofs it offers, then that implies accepting all that it\nteaches even if we are not able to understand certain things or the wisdom\nbehind them due to our limitations.\nFor a Muslim it is through reasoning that we understand\nthe laws of God coupled with sincere effort and intention.  Laws that we know\nhave been established in order to make our path to a blissful afterlife clear. \nIslamic scholar, Sheikh Ibn Taymiyah (1263 – 1328 CE) explained the link\nbetween reasoning and faith.\nReason is a requirement for acquiring knowledge and\nperforming righteous deeds, through which knowledge and deeds are perfected,\nbut it is not enough on its own.  Rather, it is a faculty of the soul and\nability like the ability within the eye to see.  If it is connected with the\nlight of faith and the Quran, then it is like the eye receiving the light of\nthe sun and torch.  If it is left to itself, it cannot gain insight into\nmatters that it cannot know alone… Thus, the circumstances resulting from the\ndenial of reason are defective, and ideas that contradict reason are false.\n[1]\nIt was the power of reasoning and logic combined with\nunwavering faith that allowed the Muslim world to prosper in what is now termed\nits Golden Age.  In the 8\nth\nto 14\nth\ncenturies CE science,\neconomic development, and culture flourished.  Scientific developments were\napplauded and investigated with the understanding that they were blessings from\nGod.  Compare this with the way scientific advancement was considered by Christianity\nin the same period.  The rule of faith dominated reason, and unlike Islam,\nreason and faith were not thought to complement each other.\nEven now in the 21\nst\ncentury there are\naspects of faith and reason, in religions other than Islam that do not bear up\nwell under close scrutiny.  Take for instance the Trinity, one of the core\nbeliefs in Christianity.  The idea that God is a man or that a man is God, is\nso illogical that it has been the touchstone of many Christians turning to Islam.\nWhen our reasoning is based on logical conclusions, God’s\ncommandments, and our own moral compass, we feel comfortable and confident in\nour faith.  Islam allows us to live and thrive in an ever-changing world\nbecause God tells us to think.   He tells us to use our own powers of\ndeduction, improve our faith and improve our world through reason and religion.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nMajmūʻ al-Fatāwá 3/338",

    "content": "But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the\nconvictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals,\nare of any value or at all trustworthy.  Would anyone trust in the convictions\nof a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind?\n[1]\nThis\nis an excerpt from a letter written in 1881 by Charles Darwin.  What troubled\nhim was the notion of trusting the human mind; if we evolved from lower life\nforms; if we can be reduced down to random, non-rational physical processes,\nhow can our minds be rational?\nIndeed,\nquestions such as, Can we trust our minds?, Can we reason to the truth?,\nand, Why and how have we acquired the ability to understand the universe?\nhave captured the minds of great thinkers throughout the ages.  Our minds are\ntruly fascinating; we have mental faculties which outshine all other creatures,\nand we seem to have cognitive abilities which surpass the requirements of\nnatural selection.\nNatural\nselection is not concerned with truth value but rather survival value.  Both\ntrue, as well as false beliefs, can adequately result in survival.  Take this\nas an analogy: John and Mark are asked to run across a busy highway blindfolded. \nJohn’s cognitive faculties are functioning perfectly; when he is asked to do\nthis, he reasons to the conclusion that this would be extremely dangerous and\ndeclines the offer.  On the other hand, Mark’s cognitive faculties are\nimpaired, which result in him believing that there is no traffic.  At the same\ntime, he holds the belief that someone has just glued his feet to the ground,\nwhich results in him not running across the road.  This simple example\nillustrates that survival is not contingent on truth.\nIt\nisn't only our minds which are amazing, we also live in a rational universe.\nAgain,\nif everything was simply a by-product of non-rational, blind, random physical\nprocesses, how have we ended up with a rationally ineligible universe? A\nuniverse governed by distinctive laws and one which is mathematically coherent. \nMany have been mesmerized by the rational nature and order of the universe;\nthis is captured in the statement of Einstein, when he said, What is\ninconceivable about the universe is that it is at all conceivable.\n[2]\nWe live in an ordered\nrational universe! Order does not come from disorder; we wouldn't expect\nscrabble pieces thrown into the air at random to land spelling a concise\nsentence.  Rationality does not come from non-rationality; believing such a\nthing would be absurd.  It would be the equivalent of claiming that something\ncould arise from nothing.\nAs\na race, humans have progressed in leaps and bounds in the sciences, yet the two\nfundamental requirements to do science—a rational mind and a rational\nuniverse—have gone unaccounted for.  Having one without the other would render\nscience non-existent.  Both need to work uniquely together in a complementary\nway to make science possible.  An analogy which comes to mind is of a lock and\na key: the rational mind being the key which has the potential to unlock the\nrational universe.\nHere\narises another problem for atheism: how is it that we have a mind which can\ncomprehend the order and rationality of the universe? Keys do not just fit\nlocks by chance, they are designed to fit.  This makes sense of God’s existence. \nIf rationality cannot come from non-rationality, and since we cannot trust our\nminds if they are just a result of blind, non-rational forces, then what best\nexplains the fact that we do trust our minds and that rationality can only come\nfrom rationality? An All-Knowing and All-Wise being (God) that created the\nuniverse with the ability for sentient beings to have rational faculties is the\nbest explanation for this.\nIn\nthe Quran, seldom does God engage humanity in attempting to prove His existence. \nInstead, He takes us from His existence, which is self-evidently true, to His\nworship.  One way God does this is by directing us towards His creation;\nencouraging us to look into creation wherein lie His signs.  It is through\npondering and reflecting over these signs that we can appreciate His majesty\nand creative power, which naturally leads us to knowing and affirming that He\ndeserves to be worshipped.\nGod\nsays in the Quran,\nIndeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and\nthe alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.\n(Quran 3:190) We can draw a\nbeautiful conclusion from this: God gave us a rational mind and a rational\nuniverse so we can reflect over this creation and through this, fulfil our\npurpose which is to worship God: the One who made us and gave us everything.  Indeed,\nthe One who made everything and gave us everything deserves to be worshipped.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nDarwin, C.  R.  to Graham, William.  3 July 1881.\n[2]\nSantillana, Giorgio de and Hertha von Dechend.  Hamlet's Mill: an Essay on Myth\nand the Frame of Time.  Boston: Godine, 1977.",

    "content": "God makes it very\nclear that the purpose of our lives is to worship Him,\nAnd I did not create\nthe jinn (spirit world) and mankind except to worship Me.\n(Quran 51:56).   The\nconcept of worship in the Islamic tradition is profound.  Worship entails that\nwe must know, love and obey God, as well as single out and dedicate all acts of\nworship to Him alone.  If we want to know, love and obey something other than\nGod the most, including direct acts of worship (like ultimate gratitude) to\nsomething other than Him, then that is our object of worship.  In this sense,\nhuman beings, including those who do not believe in God, cannot not worship.  However,\nmany misdirect their worship to things other than God; something this essay\naims to address.\nAccording to the Islamic spiritual tradition, acts of\nworship are accepted if they fulfil two conditions.  The first is that the act\nof worship should be done purely for the sake of God.  The second is that the action\nitself is prescribed by the Islamic source texts: the Quran and the authentic\nProphetic traditions.  So a natural question that follows from this is:\nWhat\nare these acts of worship?\nThe acts of worship are many.  Any good action that is\ndone to please God is an act of worship.  However, there are some basic acts of\nworship which are essential to Islamic spiritual practice.  These have been\nsummarised by the Prophet Muhammad, may God’s peace and blessings be upon him, as\nthe five pillars of Islam.  They include: affirming and recognising in one’s\nheart that there is no deity worthy of worship except God and that Muhammad,\nmay God’s peace and blessings be upon him, is God’s final messenger; praying\nfive times a day; giving the obligatory charity if one can afford to; fasting\nin Ramadan (the 9\nth\nmonth of the Islamic calendar) and performing\nthe pilgrimage if one is able to do so.  These acts of worship have profound\nmeanings and inner dimensions.  These are the basic pillars of Islam.  However,\nin developing one’s spiritual practice one can engage in a plethora of\nadditional spiritual activities.  These include: reciting the Quran;\nremembrance of God; removing the spiritual diseases in one’s heart; voluntary\ncharity; repentance; spiritual reflection; conveying the message of Islam to\nothers; feeding the poor; spreading peace; taking care of animals; studying the\nlife of the Prophet Muhammad, may God’s peace and blessings be upon him;\nmemorising the Quran; the night prayer; reflecting on natural phenomena and\nmuch more.\nSince our reason for being is to worship the Divine, it\nis important to understand why we must dedicate all acts of worship to Him\nalone.  In this essay I will provide 7 reasons for why we must worship God and\ndedicate all acts of worship to Him alone.  These reasons include:\n1.God is worthy of worship by virtue of who He is.\n2.God has created and sustains everything.\n3.God provides us with innumerable favours.\n4.If we love ourselves, we must love God.\n5.God is The-Loving, and His love is the purest form of love.\n6.Worship is part of who we are.\n7.Obeying God is the most rational thing to do.\nKnowing God\nBefore I discuss the above reasons, it is important to\nelaborate on what is meant by knowing God.  Knowledge of God is essential to\nunderstanding why God is worthy of our worship, because we cannot worship\nsomething we are ignorant of.  This is why, in the Islamic tradition,\ntraversing a path of knowing God is a form of worship:\nSo know,\nthat there is no deity except God. (Quran 47:19)\nTo know God means that we affirm that He is the sole\ncreator and maintainer of everything that exists (known as\nOneness of God’s\nCreativity\n).  It also entails that we affirm His names and attributes in\nthe context of recognising that they are unique and that nothing can compare to\nGod (known as\nOneness of God’s Names and Attributes\n).  Knowledge of God\nalso involves that we must know that He is unique in His Divinity; He alone is\nentitled to all acts of worship (known as\nOneness of God’s Divinity\n).  It\nmust be noted that in Islamic theology it is critical to affirm that nothing\nwhatsoever shares in God’s creative power and ability, names and attributes,\nand Divinity.  All forms of anthropomorphism are completely rejected.  God is\ntranscendent and maximally perfect.  He has no imperfections.  The concept of\noneness in the Islamic spiritual tradition is referred to as\ntawheed\n,\nwhich linguistically means to affirm oneness or to make something one or\nunique.\nOneness of Creativity\nThe oneness of God’s Creativity is to affirm and\nrecognise that God is the sole creator, master and owner of everything that\nexists.  God is the One who sustains, takes care of, and nourishes everything. \nAccording to the Islamic doctrine of\ntawheed\n, anyone who denies this has\nassociated partners with God, which is polytheism (known as\nshirk\nin\nIslamic theology).  Anyone who believes that these descriptions of God can be\nshared by any created thing has deified that thing.  Therefore, they have\nassociated partners with God.\nOneness of God’s Names and Attributes\nThe ‘oneness of God’s names and attributes’ means to\ndescribe God only by the names and attributes by which He has described\nHimself, which are found in the Quran and the Prophetic teachings (some names\nsuch as\nAl-Khaaliq\n, The-Creator, and\nAl-Qadeer\n, The-Powerful, can\nbe affirmed by a sound rational mind).  These names and attributes, such as\nThe-Loving and The-Subtle, are affirmed but they are not comparable to creation. \nGod’s names and attributes are perfect without any deficiency or flaw, God is\nmaximally perfect.  God’s names are described by God Himself as the most\nbeautiful:\nThe\nmost beautiful names belong to God: so call on Him by them. (Quran 7:180)\nThe one who compares these names and attributes to\ncreation has committed humanisation, and therefore has associated partners with\nGod.  The one who compares any created thing to God has committed deification,\nwhich is also a form of associating partners with God.\nOneness of God’s Divinity\nThe oneness of God’s Divinity is that we must affirm\nthat all acts of worship must be directed to Him alone.  Someone who directs\nacts of worship to anything other than God, and the one who seeks reward from\nanything other than God in any act of worship, has associated partners with\nHim.\nIn certain contexts some acts of obedience, if directed\nto other than God, do not constitute associating partners with Him.  For\nexample, one’s love for God may be deficient and require perfecting.  Associating\npartners with God in the context of love would involve loving something or\nsomeone instead of God or as much as God.  Someone can love their family and it\nwould not constitute associating partners with God.  If they loved their family\ninstead of God or as much as God, then that would constitute a form of\nassociating partners with Him.",

    "content": "The gravest sin\nAssociating\npartners with God is the gravest sin.  The consequence of this sin is that the\none who dies in such a state and has not repented dies in a state of disbelief. \nThis will never be forgiven by God.  (This applies to major forms of\nassociating partners with God.  There are lesser forms that do not lead to\ndisbelief, such as giving charity for other than God, obeying someone instead\nof God and showing off one’s good deeds.  However, major forms of associating\npartners with God such as praying to other than Him and believing other things\nare worthy of worship lead to disbelief.  This however is a nuanced topic with\nmany variables to consider, I suggest further study on this topic, as it is not\nthe objective to go in to detail here.):\nIndeed, God does not forgive association with Him, but He\nforgives what is less than that for whom He wills.  And he who associates\nothers with God has certainly committed a tremendous sin. (Quran 4:48)\nHowever, if one associates partners with God and repents\nto Him and returns to the path of oneness, he or she will be forgiven, and\ntheir transgressions will be transformed into good deeds:\nAnd those who invoke not any other deity along with God…\nExcept those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds; for those, God\nwill change their sins into good deeds, and God is Oft Forgiving, Most\nMerciful. (Quran 25:68 & 70)\nThe one who has associated partners with God and has\nnever repented, and dies in that state (and has no excuse), has essentially\noppressed themselves by closing the door to God’s mercy.  Their hearts have\n‘eternally’ rejected God’s guidance and mercy; therefore, they have alienated\nthemselves from the Divine.  Those who reject God will plead to go back to\nearth to do righteousness, but their hearts have ‘eternally’ rejected:\n[For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when\ndeath comes to one of them, he says, ‘My Lord, send me back that I might do\nrighteousness in that which I left behind.’ No! It is only a word he is\nsaying. (Quran 23:99-100)\nThis self-imposed spiritual reality is a form of denial. \nThe person has denied all the just and fair opportunities that God has given\nthem to embrace His mercy and love:\nGod has not wronged them, but they wronged themselves. (Quran\n3:117)\nThis is reward for what your hands have done.  And God is\nnever unjust to His servants. (Quran 8:51)\nIt must be noted that according to Islamic theology, if\nsomeone was not given the right message of Islam, and sought the truth, they\nwill have an excuse and will be tested on the Day of Judgment.\n[1]\nGod is\nThe-Just and no one will be treated unjustly.  This is why, when a non-Muslim\nhas passed away, it is considered un-Islamic to pass judgment on their final\nabode (however, some scholars have said this may not apply to those who never\nsought the truth or had sufficient knowledge of Islam).  No one knows what is in\nsomeone else’s heart and whether someone was given the right message in the\nright way.  However, from a creedal and societal point of view, non-Muslims who\ndied will be buried as non-Muslims.  This does not mean that this is their\nfinal judgement.  In reality, God is maximally and perfectly just and merciful,\nso no one will be treated unmercifully and no one will be treated unjustly.\nPeople who have heard the message of Islam in a sound\nand correct way will have to account for their denial.  However, whoever dies\nwithout having heard the message of Islam, or heard it in a distorted form,\nwill be given an opportunity to accept the truth.  Echoing the principles from\nthe various verses of the Quran and the Prophetic traditions, Al-Ghazali summarises\nthis nuanced approach.  He argues that people who never heard the message of\nIslam will have an excuse: In fact, I would say that, God willing, most of the\nByzantine Christians and the Turks of this age will be included in God’s mercy. \nI’m referring here to those who live in the farthest regions of Byzantium and\nAnatolia who have not come into contact with the message… They are excused.\n[2]\nAl-Ghazali also argues that the people who heard\nnegative things of the Prophet Muhammad, may God’s peace and blessings be upon\nhim, and his message will also be excused: These people knew the name\n‘Muhammad’, but nothing of his character or his qualities.  Instead, all they\nheard since childhood is that a liar and imposter called ‘Muhammad’ claimed to\nbe a prophet… This party, in my opinion, is like the first party.  For even\nthough they’ve heard his name, they heard the opposite of what his true\nqualities were.  And this does not provide enough incentive for them to\ninvestigate [his true status].\n[3]\nThe true teachings of Islam are a barrier to extremism. \nIn my view, all forms of extremism are based on an ‘ideological hardness’ that\nhardens people’s hearts.  What I mean by this is that people adopt\nnon-negotiable, binary and negative assumptions about the world and other\npeople.  This makes one group of people ‘otherize’ another.  Otherization is\nnot simply labelling people as belonging to other groups.  This is natural and\npart of modern society.  Otherization usually happens when one group describes\nanother group in a negative way and maintains that each member is the same.  This\nhardens people’s hearts and prevents them from positively engaging with other\npeople who seem to be different.  Islam does not otherize people.  It does not\nassert that everyone who is not a Muslim is ultimately doomed or evil.  The Quran\nmakes it quite clear that people constituting other groups are not all alike\n[4]\nand\ndescribes some of them as upright\n[5]\n. \nThe Quran also applies this concept to believers too; some are righteous and\nsome are not.  Nevertheless, Islam teaches that every human being must be\ntreated with mercy, compassion and fairness.\nFootnotes:\n[1]\nThis is based on the following authentic tradition narrated by Ahmad and Ibn\nHibban: There are four (who will protest) to God on the Day of Resurrection:\nthe deaf man who never heard anything, the insane man, the very old man, and\nthe man who died during the\nfatrah\n(the interval between the time of \nJesus (upon whom be peace) and the time of Muhammad, may God’s peace and\nblessings be upon him.  The deaf man will say, ‘O Lord, Islam came but I never\nheard anything.’ The insane man will say, ‘O Lord, Islam came but the children\nran after me and threw stones at me.’ The very old man will say, ‘O Lord, Islam\ncame but I did not understand anything.’ The man who died during the\nfatrah\nwill say, ‘O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me.’ He will accept their promises\nof obedience, then word will be sent to them to enter the Fire.  By the One in\nWhose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe\nfor them. There are other hadiths and verses of the Quran that indicate that\nGod will not allow anyone to enter hell until people have been given the\ncorrect message of Islam.\n[2]\nAl-Ghazali, M.  A.  (1993) Fayasl al-Tafriqa Bayn al-Islam\nwa-l-Zandaqa.  Edited by M.  Bejou.  Damascus, p.  84.  An online copy\nis available at:\nhttp://ghazali.org/books/fiysal-bejou.pdf\n[Accessed 21st November 2016].\n[3]\nIbid.\n[4]\nThe Quran, Chapter 3, Verse 113.  This verse refers to the ‘people of the book’. \nHowever, the principle applies to all groups of people.\n[5]\nIbid.",
