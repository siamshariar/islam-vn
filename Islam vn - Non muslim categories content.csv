Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
What drives us?  What makes us do the things we
do?  What makes us happy?
Many people will answer maximizing pleasure and
minimizing pain is the ultimate key to human happiness.
If so, how come people can be happy while in
pain and unhappy while experiencing pleasure?  If pleasure is not the only
motivating force that drives us, what does?  What desires must we fulfill to
live a happy life?
For most of those who see happiness in the carnal,
rather than the spiritual, it is pretty basic: desire to avoid pain and
anxiety, desire to spend time with relatives, desire to eat, desire for sexual
gratification, desire for companionship, and desire for recognition to name a
few.
Life for such can be toilsome, provoking the
plain query; what is it really aiming for?  In their quest for happiness, all
too often people fall short of achieving any kind of inner peace.  We think
that by always reaching higher and accomplishing more - more money, a better
body, the perfect mate - we will automatically be happy.  That is an illusion. 
People get caught up in chasing the materialistic dream under the illusion
money can buy happiness until they discover the limits of materialism.  Impressing
the neighbors and envy of possessions leaves us devoid of passion and depth in
our lives, leading to the Modern Man’s Paradox:  Spiritual hunger in an age of
plenty.
What is the paradox?  Simply put, it is this: As
members of certain materialistic societies have grown richer, they have grown
less content with their lives.  No society in the history of the world has ever
enjoyed the standard of living known today in these societies: Incomes are up,
prices are stable, unemployment is down, life expectancy is rising; they enjoy
more freedom and opportunity than ever before.  Even their poor live well by
world standards.  Yet in America, for example, since 1960, the divorce rate has
doubled, teen suicide has tripled, violent crime has quadrupled, the prison
population has quintupled, and some estimates put the incidence of depression
in the year 2000 at ten times what it was in the year 1900.  Americans are less
happy today than they were 40 years ago, despite the fact that they make 2.5
times as much money.  Our bellies may be filled, but we are left spiritually
hungry.
To find out what really drives human behavior,
two kinds of happiness must be distinguished: feel-good happiness and
value-based happiness.  Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure.  When
we joke around or eat our favorite food, we experience feel-good happiness.  This
type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time.
Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives
have meaning and fulfill the larger purpose of our existence by connecting us
to Allah.  It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our
deeper purpose and values.  Living a God-conscious life rooted in the values of
the Quran and
Sunnah
, a Muslim is driven - beyond sensual pleasures - by
the desire to make it to Paradise and to be safe from Hell after death.
Islamic values that take a person towards Paradise and away from Hell are the most significant factors in motivating a Muslim’s
behavior and in contributing to his or her sense of happiness. The desire to achieve
 Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all
other desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on
wealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of
making it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of
devotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on
pleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One
must remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.
To be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams
and realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!
Ultimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate
goal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. 
Paradise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of
God, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence
of pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is
an abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel
the least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally
realized.

·To learn about some of the joys that Paradise
holds.
·To appreciate that the greatest joy will be
seeing Allah in Paradise.
The Joys of Paradise
Those who enter Paradise will do so in their
most perfect, beautiful form.  Their hearts will be one.  They will neither
spit, nor blow their noses, or defecate.  They will remain young forever,
strong and potent without the inconveniences of body hair.
The worldly pleasures pretty much fade in the
face of heavenly delights
.
The pleasures of this world are
fleeting and short-lived, for ‘…short is the enjoyment of this world,’ whereas
the joys of Paradise will be unending, as ‘…the provision is eternal.’
The fine clothes, delicious foods, soothing
drinks, ornate jewels, and grand palaces in Paradise are far superior to what
is in this world.  The ‘real estate’ of Paradise is described by the Prophet to
be better than the whole world!
Paradise is free of any pollutants, foul odors,
pain, or discomfort.  The hearts and speech will be pure.  No one will be
offended or insulted.
The delicious, ripe fruits of Paradise will be
within easy reach, ready for its residents to pick whatever fruit one desires. 
Any food or drink will be available on demand.  Paradise has seas of water,
wine, milk, and honey from which rivers will flow out.  You simply take your
pick!  It has fountains scented with camphor and ginger, and shady valleys.  The
wine will not cause hangovers.  It is “delight for those who drink”, bringing
neither drunkenness
[1]
nor rousing
folly or quarrelling.
The inhabitants of Paradise will be served in
gold and silver goblets and dishes.  Their finest silk clothes will be
decorated with gold, silver, and pearls…better than any man-made garment!  The
scent of Musk will emanate from their bodies..  Their palaces will distinguished
by refined elegance and be fully furnished.  They will be able to sit and
recline in their gardens.  The beautiful bright colored couches will be lined
with silk brocade.  Eye catching cushions and splendid carpets will add style
and luxury.  A cozy place most people can simply dream of in this world, and  tranquil
spot away from distractions;  peaceful, comfortable, and richly decorated.
The faithful, who ‘will be served by immortal youths,
with cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine;’ exquisite banquets
served in priceless vessels.
The faithful will visit one another and reunite
with family and friends who made it to Paradise.  All wishes will be fulfilled,
some in the strangest ways.  The Messenger of Allah said:
“If the believer in Paradise wishes for a
child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in
an instant.” (
Al-Tirmidhi
)
Naturally, running after worldly pleasures at
the cost of heavenly delights will be a cause of much sorrow for people who
will enter Hell.
Spouses & Intimacy in Paradise
Just as some people can’t perceive colors, so we
may be soul-blind and soul-deaf.  The soul’s yearnings simply don’t get through
to consciousness; or if they do, we try to numb ourselves to them with
medications or frenzied activities.  The resulting alienation within our very
hearts bears its own loneliness.  The soul wants to be attached and involved,
because it is through such intimacy that it is nourished, initiated, and
deepened.  The faithful will enjoy earthly and heavenly spouses in Paradise
to satisfy the soul’s cravings for companionship and intimacy.  All the
urgencies of the soul – the feeling of longing, the ache of desire for a
beautiful, compatible partner, and the urgency to visit old friends – will be
met.  The select will rejoice in the company of the parents, spouses and
children who were believers.
The faithful will be clothed in the richest
silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns
set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, and pillows. In order
to enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,
and vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise
“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most
able to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and
strength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose
their youth.”
The faithful will enter Paradise in the best and
most perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their
eternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.
The faithful will enjoy specially crafted
maidens, or
houris
, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of
mortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,
and inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public
view in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of
gratification.
Vision of Allah
In heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly
and distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through "

Remembrance of Allah
Almost every person in the
modern world is involved in some basic worldly activity like earning a living,
going to school, eating, sleeping, and socializing.  Naturally, we forget Allah
and the obligations due to Him.  When we forget Allah, this life and its
worries become the central occupation of the human mind.  Desires run wild.  A
person begins to ‘chase his shadow’, something he can never catch.  For many,
money becomes the sole goal of life.  The more you make, the more you spend,
the more you want.
Allah has set times to break
regularly from the daily chores of life for a few minutes and worship Him.  First
thing in the morning before we begin our day, in the middle of the day, in the
late afternoon, in the evening, and at night before we go to sleep.  When done
with concentration and properly, it awakens and stimulates the soul.  A Muslim
reminds himself that Allah is in charge of everything, he is Allah’s faithful
servant, and Allah’s pleasure is His aim.  For a few minutes, five times a day,
a Muslim leaves this world and meets  His Lord:
“And establish the prayers (
salah
)
in order to remember Me.” (Quran 20:14)
Taqwa
(God-consciousness)
The prayers (
salah
) also
makes a person God-conscious.  When a person prays five times a day, he becomes
accustomed to feeling the presence of God and develops the sense that Allah is watching
Him at all times.  He is never hidden from Allah, even when alone.  A sense of
God-consciousness keeps the heart suspended between fear and hope.  Fear of
Allah keeps a Muslim away from the prohibited and encourages him to do the
obligatory; a mix of divine love and devout reverence that keeps him
religiously observant. Regular performance of the prayers increases one’s awareness
of Allah.
Seeking Forgiveness
To err is human, and even the
most pious of Muslims sin and need to repent.  We all need to constantly ask
for Allah’s forgiveness and try our best not to repeat our mistakes.  Without
regular contact with Allah, a person is unlikely to feel guilty for his sins
and repent.  Sometimes if a person has not asked Allah to forgive him in a long
time, he might become insensitive to sinning and may even forget that he fell
into it, thus not even seeking forgiveness for it.  Certain prayers in the formal
prayers (
salah
) reminds the Muslim of his sins and makes him seek
forgiveness for them  This in turn causes Muslims to feel guilty for their sins
and seek repentance as soon as they are committed. A Muslim learns to constantly
seeks forgiveness for his sins and never feels too distant from his loving Lord.  
The prayer places man directly before Allah seeking pardon for his short-comings.
The prayer itself is a means of
erasing sins, albeit the lesser ones
[1]
.
Messenger of Allah, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked:
“What do you think if
there was a river by the door of any one of you and he bathed in it five times
a day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?”
They (his companions) said,
“No trace of dirt would be left on him.”
The Prophet said, “This is
like the five daily prayers, through which Allah erases sin.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Control and Discipline
The prayer has the capacity to
catalyze change for the better in people’s life.  The fact that we give up
whatever we are doing and line up behind a prayer leader (called
imam
) five
times a day in the mosque, or find room to pray in at work or school by
ourselves, instills discipline in life.  People join the army to learn
discipline and everyone admires it.  Similarly, the prayer trains us to go
through specific motions and utter special words at specific times.  All the
body parts are under control, obeying and worshipping Allah, and if this
discipline is broken, the prayer may have to be repeated.
Islam recognizes that we are all
different, so it allows flexibility in many cases.  The prayer leader (
imam
)
should keep the prayer short.  Women are not required to attend the prayers in
the mosque.  A sick person may pray sitting, and if unable, he may even pray
laying down.  The discipline learned in the prayer is to be acquired in other
aspects of one’s religious and mundane life as well.  Just as we should not
look around when praying, we should control our eyes outside of the prayer not
to fall on forbidden objects.  Just like we use our tongue to prai"

Hadith
– (plural –
ahadith
) is
a piece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
Why
am I here is an age old question that has plagued humankind for millennia.  What
is the purpose of my life, what is the purpose of anyone’s life? Those and
other similar questions have been asked by people as long
as human life has existed.  It is expressed by someone, somewhere all the time. 
It is expressed in many different forms, such as ""What should I do?"",
""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"", and
""What is the purpose of existence?"" and even ""Does life exist at
all?""  In the great scheme of things Muslims are in a very privileged position
because when these existential questions pop into our minds we are able to
comprehend the answer.
The reason that we (humankind) are here, on this tiny
planet spinning in a seemingly infinite universe, is to worship Allah and Allah
Alone.   This is the purpose for which we were created.  It is not a secret or
a mystery nor is it an enigma or a puzzle.   Finding the meaning of life is
possible with only one thing, a desire to fulfil Allah’s plan.  There is no
need for hours or months or years of searching and yearning.
“And I (Allah) created not the
jinn
and humankind,
except to worship Me (Alone).” (Quran 51:56)
“Oh humankind, worship Allah, you have no other Allah but
Him.” (Quran 7:59)
However it is important to understand that Allah is not
in need of human worship.  If not a single human worshipped Allah, it would not
diminish His glory in any way, and if all of humankind worshipped Him, it would
not increase His glory in any way.
[1]
“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes
you, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let
believers put their trust."" (Quran 3:160)
""O humankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but
Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise."" (Quran
35:15)
Because we are fragile humans we need the comfort and
security of worshipping Allah.  In addition to that we will not find true
happiness and contentment until we at the very least attempt to fulfil our
purpose in life.  The purpose of our existence is more meaningful than being
slaves to the
dunya
.  Allah states that the reality of this
dunya
is full of deception and warns us not to fall for its temporary enjoyments.  We
should focus on our purpose in life in order to secure our place in the
Akhirah.
In a
hadith
Prophet Muhammad tells us that,
“Allah says, 'Son of Adam, fill your time with my worship and I will fill your
heart with richness, and end your poverty.  But if you do not, I will make your
hands busy (in
dunya
affairs) and I would not end your poverty.’”
[2]
The religion of Islam explains our purpose plainly,
whilst giving us clear guidelines to follow in order to make our worship easier
and more fulfilling.  Everything is explained in the Quran and the
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad.  They are our guide books for a life full of purpose and
contentment.    They are the only means to true happiness but this however does
not mean that we will not be tried and tested.   Allah states very clearly in
Quran that He will test us.
“He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of
you is best in deed...” (Quran 67:1-2)
Of course the life of a human being can be filled with
play and pleasure, but this is not the purpose of our lives.  Allah says in the
Quran that we were indeed created for a purpose beyond that of mere delight and
enjoyment.  The reality of life is that we will be resurrected to account for
every detail of our lives.
“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any
purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?” (Quran 23:115)
One of the easiest ways to have the best of everything
is to worship Allah in everything that we do.  Islam makes this easy.  It is as
simple as following the guidelines set out for us.  To remember Allah at every
opportunity and to conduct our lives knowing that Allah is watching us, and
angels are recording our every move.  By worshipping Allah we are doing ourselves
a favour.  When we are God-conscious we act in an upright manner and stay away
from being evil and oppressing others.  And we also know that the laws of Islam
are designe"

What is
Shariah
“
Shariah
” is a misunderstood word
second to ‘Jihad’ and is usually translated as ‘Islamic Law.’ An incomplete translation
leads to much confusion.  Therefore, we must first understand the meaning of
the term.
In essence, “
Shariah
” refers to what Allah has
legislated for His slaves,
[1]
whether it be beliefs, practice, worship, or morals.  It is the totality of
Allah’s commands.
[2]
Another author defines ‘
Shariah’
to be the ‘commands, prohibitions,
guidance and principles that God has addressed to mankind pertaining to their
conduct in this world and salvation in the next.’
[3]
Shariah
includes the following
[4]
:
1.Creed: including the oneness of Allah, rejection of
shirk
,
belief in Angels, Divine Scriptures, Prophets, and the Last Day.
2.Ethics: being true, trustworthy, keeping promises, and rejection
of immorality like lying, breaking promises, etc.
3.Religious Practices: matters related to worship and dealing with
fellow human beings including specific crimes and their punishment.
In short,
Shariah
guides all aspects of Muslim
life, including daily prayers, marriage, divorce, family obligations, and
financial dealings.
Unique Features of
Shariah
1.
Shariah
comes from Allah
.  It is Allah’s
revelation to His Prophet Muhammad, either directly in the form of the Quran or
indirectly in the form of
Sunnah
.  This in turn means:
a.The principles of
Shariah
are free of injustice and are
not subject to human discretions.  An example is the equality of human beings
regardless of their color, gender, or language.  They are only ‘distinguished’
from each other based on their good works!
b.
Shariah
is to be upheld by all believers, whether they are
rulers or the ruled because it is from Allah.  An example is the prohibition of
drugs and alcohol; it is forbidden upon all without exception.
c.
Shariah
promises the doer of good works great rewards in
this life and in the next, and warns the sinner of a grave punishment in this
life and the next.  The recompense of the life to come is tied to living by and
applying
Shariah
in one’s daily life in matters like ablution, prayer,
and zakah.
2.
Shariah
is timeless and universally applicable.
We
believe that
Shariah
is suitable and applicable for all times and places.
3.
Shariah
is comprehensive.
It includes matters of
belief, Islamic ethics, and rules governing speech and action.  The rules
governing speech and action are called “
fiqh
” or Islamic jurisprudence and
can be further subdivided into the following categories:
a.Worship like prayer and fasting.  It governs a person’s relation
to his Lord.
b.Human relationships that include personal, civil law, financial
law, law of war and peace, and criminal law.
4.
Shariah
is humane.
It brings ease and removes
hardship which is a natural consequence of its comprehensiveness and perfection. 
Allah says,
“…Allah desires ease for you and does not desire hardship for
you…”(Quran 2:185)
Therefore,
Shariah
eases an obligatory duty when
performing it causes an excessive hardship and it temporarily allows a prohibited
action when there is a dire need for it
[5]
.
“…But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it]
nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him.  Indeed, Allah is
Forgiving and Merciful.” (Quran 2:173)
An example of a hardship that would ease an obligatory
duty is if one falls ill or is travelling, they can break their fast.
5.
Shariah
is based on justice.
What is meant is not
only a judge applying the law fairly to everyone, but the law itself being just. 
That is a natural consequence of its divine source. True justice should
establish an equilibrium by way of fulfilling rights and obligations and by
eliminating excess and disparity in all spheres of life.  The standard of
justice in the Quran is referred to in some fifty passages.  People are urged
to be just to others at all levels, whether personal or public, in words or in
conduct, in dealing with friends or enemies, Muslim or non-Muslim, all must be
treated with justice.  Allah says in the Quran,
“We sent Our messengers with evidences and revealed the Book
and the balance through them so as to establish justice among people…” (Quran
57:25)

Shariah
is the confirmed rules that
Allah has legislated in the Quran,
Sunnah
, and other sources which
branch out of them.
Fiqh
(Islamic jurisprudence), on the other hand,
is defined as knowledge of the practical rules of
Shariah
which are
derived from the detailed evidence in the sources.
[1]
Therefore,
Shariah
is the goal,
fiqh
is
the path.
Fiqh
is contained in specialized books and encyclopedias.  It
is a compilation of rules and regulations.
Fiqh
includes practical religious matters that
are well-known in Islam.  These consist of rules conveyed in a clear text.  Two
examples would be the duty to pray five daily prayers and the prohibition of alcohol. 
They are definite and clear.  Fiqh also includes many practical details of religious
matters that are speculative.  Does bleeding invalidate ablution?  In ablution,
is it required to wipe the entire head or only part of it? Answers to such detailed
questions can be found in books of
fiqh
.
What is the Relationship Between
Shariah
and
Fiqh
?
[2]
1.
Shariah
is the actual rules revealed by Allah
.  There
is no contradiction or conflict between them.  It is binding on all Muslims.  As
for
fiqh
, it is derived by the scholars of Islam known as
fuqaha
(jurists) from the texts of
Shariah
or other methods such as
qiyas
and
maslahah mursalah
.  These deduced rules may or may not agree with
the
Shariah
.  In other words, when a scholar is correct in his
understanding,
Shariah
and
fiqh
are in agreement.  When a scholar
makes a mistake,
Shariah
and
fiqh
separate.
Shariah
does
not exist in a vacuum.  It is found within
fiqh
.
[3]
2.
Shariah
is complete,
fiqh
is not
.
Shariah
is mostly general principles and maxims from which guidance for all aspects of
our daily life is deduced.
Fiqh
, on the other hand, is the opinion of
scholars in many cases.  For the most part
Shariah
provides guidelines
which are elaborated in
fiqh
.
3.
Shariah
is general and addresses all human beings unlike
fiqh
.
4.
Shariah
is binding whereas parts of
fiqh
are
not binding
.
Fiqh
provides relevant answers to its contemporary
society for a specific place.
Shariah
is time and place independent.
Shariah
mostly provides general directives whereas detailed solutions to particular and
unprecedented issues are developed in
fiqh
.
5.
Shariah
is perfect whereas
fiqh
is not.
Shariah
does not contain errors since it is considered divine revelation, but
fiqh
can sometimes be wrong as it is a human endeavor and a product of reasoning.
Rules of
Fiqh
Rules of
fiqh
are categorized on a scale of five
values:
1.
Wajib
(obligatory): what is required upon a Muslim, like the
five daily prayers.
2.
Mustahab
(recommended): what a Muslim is encouraged to do,
like fasting on Mondays and Thursdays.
3.
Mubah
(permissible): what is left up to a Muslim to do or
leave, like picking a certain food or drink.
4.
Makruh
(disliked): what is better to leave for a Muslim,
like praying while food is being served.
5.
Haram
(forbidden): what a Muslim is prohibited from, like
adultery and theft.
The Stages of the Evolution of
Fiqh
Fiqh was developed over the course of time across
different geographical areas of the Muslim world.  It’s evolution over a span
of 1400 years can be classified into six stages
[4]
:
1.Foundation: era of Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him, 609 -
632 CE.
2.Establishment: era of the Righteous Caliphs, 632 - 661 CE.
3.Building: era of Umayyad dynasty, 661 CE - 8
th
century.
4.Flowering: era of rise and decline of Abbasid dynasty, 8
th
century - middle of 10
th
century.
5.Consolidation: from decline of Abbasid dynasty to murder of last
Abbasid Caliph, 960 CE - middle of 13
th
century.
6.Stagnation & Decline: from sacking of Baghdad to the present,
1258 CE - now.
Qualifications of a
Faqih

The three basic qualifications of an Islamic scholar who
specializes in
fiqh
are:

One of the
sahabah
once asked Prophet Muhammad
which was the first
masjid
built on earth.  He replied, “The Sacred Mosque
in Mecca”.  “Which was next?” the
sahabi
asked and the Prophet replied “Al-Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem”.
[1]
Prophet Muhammad advised his followers not to prepare
for a religious journey except to three mosques.
[2]
These three mosques are the three holiest sites in Islam
and are situated in three sacred cities, Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.  All
three cities are in the Middle East, two in present day Saudi Arabia and the
other in the Holy Land, now known as either Palestine or Israel.  In two
lessons we will look closely at the significance of the three cities and
discuss what they mean to Muslims around the globe.
Mecca
Mecca is home to the largest
masjid
in the world,
Masjid Al-Haraam
(The Sacred Mosque).  It surrounds the
Kabah
, a
cube shaped structure that Muslims believe is the world’s first house of
worship.  In the 21
st
century the
masjid
has a large outdoor
terrace with white marble floors that reflect the bright light during the day
and are floodlit at night.   It is a huge space that allows for the influx of
up to 4 million people in the
Hajj
season.  It is a space that is always
awake and where people from all over the globe congregate to spend their days
and nights in worship and contemplation.   Mecca nowadays is a far cry from its
humble beginnings.
The area in which Mecca stands has been the subjects of stories
stretching back to the very beginning of time.  Both the Quran and the Bible
mention Mecca’s earlier name of Becca as a place of worship.  “…Blessed are
those whose strength is in You who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.  As
they pass through the valley of Becca, they make it a place of springs…”
[3]
“Verily the first house of worship appointed for mankind was
at Becca…” (Quran 3:96)
The first Muslims prayed towards MasjidAl-Aqsa in
Jerusalem.   While in exile in Medina Prophet Muhammad received a revelation
from God instructing him to turn towards the
Kabah
.   Thus it became the
qibla
for Muslims throughout the world.  The historians and scholars of
Islam have differed on who built the
Kabah
.  Some say that it was built
by the angels.   Others say the father of humankind, Adam built the
Kabah
but over many centuries it fell into disrepair only to be rebuilt by Prophet
Ibrahim and his son Ishmael.   All agree that the
Kabah
was either built
or rebuilt by Prophet Ibrahim.
“And remember when Ibrahim and his son were raising the
foundations of the House (the
Kabah
at Mecca), (saying), ‘Our Lord!
Accept this service from us.  Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower’”
(Quran 2:127)
Prophet Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in 570
BCE.  At that time Mecca was an oasis on the trade routes between Yemen and the
Mediterranean Sea.  There is historical evidence indicating that goods from all
over the known world flowed through the markets of Mecca.   And pilgrims used
to come to visit the
Kabah.
At that historical point in time, it was filled
with statues and idols.
Each year pilgrims travelled to Mecca and Prophet Muhammad’s
tribe, the Quraish
[4]
,
made a very good living by trading with the pilgrims.  Muhammad’s prophethood
put their very lucrative livelihoods into jeopardy and this was one of a
complex myriad of reasons why they wrought havoc upon the Muslims and
eventually drove them from the city.
Prophet Muhammad once said of Mecca, “By Allah, you are
the best and the dearest of all lands of Allah to Him.  Had I not been driven
out of you, I would have never left you.”
[5]
And, he once observed, “Allah, not the people, has made Mecca a sanctuary;
therefore, any person who believes in Allah and the Last Day should neither
shed blood in it nor cut down its trees.”
[6]
When Prophet Muhammad returned to Mecca he took control
of the city with great diplomacy, and with boundless mercy towards its
inhabitants.  He purged the
Kabah
of idols and the Arabian Peninsula of
any worship except to Allah.   Mecca took its place in history as the spiritual
centre of Islam.
Medina
Medina, also in present day Saudi Arabia, is
the second most sacred city in Islam.  Its importance derives from the presence
of
Masjid Al-Nabawi

Medina (
continued
)
The second most sacred city in Islam is Medina. It
is in the western region of Saudi Arabia in the area known as the Hejaz. Medina
is the Arabic word for city and it is known as “the city” meaning it is the
city of Prophet Muhammad. It is also sometimes known as Medina Munawwarah
meaning the city of enlightenment.  Originally called Yathrib, Medina is the
city to which Prophet Muhammad and the fledgling Muslim community migrated when
life became too difficult in Mecca.
The original Prophet's Mosque was an open-air
building with a raised platform for sermons. It was a square enclosure of approximately
30 by 35 meters and was built from palm trunks with mud walls. It could be accessed
through three doors and its basic plan has since been adopted in the building
of many other mosques throughout the world.
The
Masjid
also contained a shaded area to the south
and a prayer area facing north towards Jerusalem. When the
qiblah
was
changed to Mecca, the
Masjid
was re-oriented to face Mecca. This space
also served as a community centre, court, and school. In only seven years the
Masjid
space was doubled to accommodate the ever increasing number of Muslims.
It is here in the
Masjid
that the tomb of Prophet
Muhammad is located. Because prophets are generally buried where they die,
Prophet Muhammad was buried in the home of his wife Aisha. This was originally
attached to the
Masjid
but in the intervening centuries the
Masjid
has expanded to such a degree that even the cemetery known as Al-Baqi, once on
the outside of the city, now marks the outer precincts of the
Masjid
.  The
graves of some of Prophet Muhammad’s family members and many
sahabah
and
early generations of scholars can be found here.
One of the most significant and important reasons why
Muslims all over the world long to visit this city filled with light and
learning is the fact that it has many blessings.
""The person who offers 40 prayers consecutively in
my
Masjid
, without missing a prayer in between, will secure immunity
from the fire of Hell and other torments and also from hypocrisy.""
[1]
Prophet Muhammad said, ""I was ordered to migrate to
a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that
is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities
of iron.” And he also said, ""There are angels guarding the entrances (or
roads) of Medina, neither plague nor
the Dajjaal
(Antichrist) will be
able to enter it.”
[2]
Medina and its surrounds are filled with the places and
sights that are infused with Islamic history. The site of the Battle of Badr is
approximately 20 miles south west of Medina, and four miles north is the site
of the Battle of Uhud. Also within a short distance is the place where the Battle
of the Ditch was fought.  Masjid Al-Quba the first mosque built  in Islam and
whose foundation stone was laid by Prophet Muhammad himself can be found here
in Medina, so too is Masjid Al-Qiblatain, the mosque built on the  site where
the revelation  to change the
qiblah
direction came. Before this
revelation the first Muslims prayed facing towards Jerusalem.
Jerusalem
The city of Jerusalem is the third most sacred site in
Islam. According to Islamic history, Prophet Jacob, built a
masjid
on
the Al-Aqsa site approximately 40 years after his grandfather Prophet Abraham
built the
Kabah
in Mecca. It was later rebuilt or expanded by King
Solomon, a man considered by Islam to also be a Prophet.
Glorified be He Who took His slave on a journey by night from Masjid
Al-Haraam to Masjid Al-Aqsa, the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in
order that We might show him of Our signs.  Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the
All-Seer. (Quran 17:1)
Muslims are much attached to Jerusalem because God
refers to it in the Quran as “the neighbourhood whereof we have blessed”.  A compound
called Masjid Al-Aqsa lies within the city of Jerusalem.  The name Al-Aqsa translates
to the farthest
masjid
. However there are multiple mosques and centres
of learning on the 144,000 square metre site including the most identifiable
building in Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock.
The golden shining dome stands out on the Jerusalem
skyline and can be recognized by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. In an event
known as the Night Journey and Ascension, Prophet Muhammad ascended to the
lowest heaven from a rock that is now found inside this most famous symbol.  On
the same journey Prophet Muh"

Introduction
The core of the religion of Islam is the attestation to
two phrases:
(i)
La ilaha illa Allah
(meaning ‘There is
no god rightfully worshipped except Allah’)
(ii)
Muhammad rasoolu Allah
(meaning
‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah’)
These two phrases are known as the
Shahadah
, or Testimony
of Faith. Through the belief and attestation of these two phrases one enters
the fold of Islam. It is the central belief that a believer maintains
throughout his life, and is the basis for all his beliefs, worship and existence
in this world.
Every Muslim, including someone new to Islam, has to
understand the meanings of these two phrases, and try to live his life
accordingly.
The Importance of the Testimony of
Faith
This Testimony is by far the most important aspect of
the religion of Islam, upon which the whole religion is built. Islam is the
only true monotheistic religion, stressing that no worship should be directed
to any other except Allah. It is a way of life in which a person obeys and
worships the orders of Allah and none else.
This Testimony of Faith (
Shahadah
) reminds us of
our purpose in life, which is the worship of Allah alone.  Allah says in the
Quran:
“And I have not created neither jinn nor humans, except to
worship Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)
The message of the Oneness of God (
Tawheed
) found
in the Testimony was not particular to the message of Prophet Muhammad, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. It was the universal message of all
Prophets of Allah. Since the dawn of humanity, Allah sent Messengers to every
people and nation, commanding them to worship Him Alone, and to reject all
false deities. Allah says:
“And indeed We have raised amongst every nation a Messenger,
[commanding them] ‘Worship Allah, and reject all false deities.” (Quran 16:36)
The Meaning of
La ilaha illa Allah
The meaning of each word in the
phrase is:
La
: There is no;
ilaha
:
god (deity);
illa
: except;
Allah
: Allah (God)
And therefore the literal
meaning of this phrase is “There is no god (deity) except Allah”
First Part of this phrase: Rejection
‘There is no god (deity)’… Here, god with a small case
‘g’ is anything which is worshipped. Many people have taken things in creation
as their gods and deities, but they are all false and are wrongfully worshipped,
meaning that they have no right to that worship, nor do they deserve it. This
rejection extends to all superstitions, ideologies, ways of life, or any
authority figures who claim divine devotion.
Some people imagine the Divine Kingdom of God to be like
earthly kingdoms. Just as a king has many ministers and trusted associates,
they imagine ‘saints’ and minor deities to be our intercessors to God.  They
take them as agents through whom God is approached. In truth, there are no
intercessors in Islam, nor any class of clergy to whom one must ‘confess’ their
sins to be forgiven. A Muslim prays directly and exclusively to God. We also
reject superstitious practices such as astrology, palm reading, good luck
charms, and fortune-telling.
Second Part of this phrase: Affirmation
‘Except Allah’… After denying the right of any created
being to be worshipped, the Testimony affirms divinity for Allah alone, with ‘…
except
Allah.’
Allah, in the Quran, mentions in many places that all
things which people take as objects of worship besides Allah do not deserve any
worship, nor do they have any right over it, as they themselves are creations
and have no power to bring any benefit.
Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created
nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for
themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor
of raising the dead. (Quran 25:3)
Thus,
la ilaha illa Allah
means, “There is no
true
god except Allah” or “There is no god rightfully worshipped except Allah.”
The Meaning of
Muhammad rasoolu Allah
The meaning of each word in the
phrase is:
Muhammad
: Prophet
Muhammad;
rasoolu
: Messenger;
Allah
: Allah (God)
And therefore this phrase means,
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”.
By testifying to this fact, one affirms that Prophet
Muhammad is in fact a Prophet and Messenger raised by God, amongst mankind to
deliver the message of God, as were other Prophets and Messengers. Attesting to
this fact implies a multitude of meanings. These include:
1.  To believe
that he was the
last
Prophet and Messenger.
“Muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the
Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets and Allah is Ever All-Aware of
everything” (Quran 33:40)
2. To believe
that he delivered the message of Allah faithfully just as he r"

Introduction
The Arabic word
shirk
[1]
is the opposite of
tawheed
, Allah’s oneness and uniqueness, and is more
inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.
Shirk
contradicts the very
purpose of creation as expressed in the Quran:
“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship Me.”
(Quran 51:56)
Prophets were sent with the mission to eradicate
shirk
and to invite humanity to single out Allah in worship.
What is
Shirk
?
Shirk
is to associate someone other than Allah in
those aspects which are unique to Allah and His exclusive right.
Shirk
is to worship created beings like Allah is worshipped, to venerate created
beings like Allah must be venerated, and to assign a portion of His divinity to
someone else.
Severity of
Shirk
There is no issue upon which Islam is so strict as the
one of
tawheed
(monotheism).  Therefore,
shirk
is considered the
greatest
violation with which the Lord of the heavens and the earth is defied.  The
severity of
shirk
can be summarized in the following points:
(1)
Shirk
makes the Creator like His
creation, in that matters that are exclusive to Allah are associated with
others who have no right to it.  Therefore, Allah declares
shirk
to be
the greatest wrong,
“Indeed to ascribe partners (unto Him) is a tremendous wrong.”
(Quran 31:13)
(2)  Allah has declared that He will not forgive
the sin of
shirk
unless the person repents from it,
“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner should be set up
with Him, and forgives all besides that to whom He pleases.” (Quran 4:48)
(3)  Allah has forbidden Paradise to those who do
not repent from committing
shirk
, condemning him to Hell for eternity,
“Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has
forbidden to him Paradise and his abode is the Fire.” (Quran 5:72)
(3)  All the good works a person may have done are
lost, become worthless, and are rendered vain if a person dies unrepentant of
shirk
,
“And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those
before you: if you should associate (anything) with Allah, your work would
surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Quran
39:65)
(4)
Shirk
is the deadliest of all major
sins.  On one occasion, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, asked his companions if they knew what was greatest of all major sins. 
He then explained to them,
“The major sins are:
shirk
, not being kind
to one’s parents…” (

Shirk
is associating others with Allah in
those aspects which are unique to Allah in his person taking a rival or associate
unto Allah and making it an equal to Allah.
Shirk

This category includes:
(i)   Atheism (the belief that human beings have no
Lord).
Pharaoh denied the existence of Allah and claimed his
own self to be the Lord over Moses and the people of Egypt.  He announced to
people:
“I am your Lord, Most High.” (Quran 79:24)
Modern day philosophers that deny the existence of Allah
or scientists who consider the universe created itself or has no beginning or
end fall under this category.  Also, the idea that nature itself is God, or
that God dwells within His creation is also
shirk
.
(b)  The belief that Allah shares His rule and
control over the creation.
People who fall into this category are those who may believe
in Allah’s powers and abilities, but also believe that Allah is several
“persons,” that He is somehow “split” into different beings.  An example is
Christians who believe that Allah is God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Spirit, all at the same time.  Also, Hindus believe in One God who takes
the forms of Brahma – the creator-god, Vishnu – the preserver-god, and Shiva –
the destroyer-god.  Islam teaches that Allah is One in every sense: perfect,
indivisible, and complete.
Another example of this
shirk
is held by people
who pray to the dead.  They believe the souls of the saints and other people
can meddle in the affairs of mortal men, that somehow the departed souls can
cause change in the life of men and women by answering their prayers or in
other ways.  The truth "

Greater
Shirk
:
Shirk
in Allah’s Right to Worship
In this category of
shirk
, acts of worship are
directed to other than Allah and the reward for worship is sought from the
creation instead of the Creator.  Praying, bowing, and putting one’s forehead
on the ground are acts of worship reserved only for Allah.
“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah, being
sincerely obedient to Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, lo, they
commit
shirk
with Him.” (Quran 29:65)
Examples of
Shirk
in Allah’s Right to Worship
(1)  To love Allah correctly is to worship Him.  A
form of greater
shirk
is giving someone a portion of love reserved for
Allah.  Allah is the only One loved for His own sake.  Two things beloved for
their own sake cannot coexist in one heart.  Love of Allah is different from
the love of one’s parents, spouse, or children as it is coupled with a feeling
of His awe and holiness and leads a person to pray to Allah, trust Him, hoping
for His mercy, fearing His punishment, and to worship Him alone.  Loving other
beings as Allah should be loved is
shirk
in love. A Muslim should not be
attached to anything else to a level where it enslaves his heart.  Hearts get attached
to power, money, glamour, women, music, drugs, and alcohol, to name a few.  These
things can become the ‘god’ in one’s life who a person chases day and night,
and, once he gets the thing he loves, he works hard to please it.  That is why
the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said a man who
worships money will always be miserable
[1]
and
the Quran says,
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides
Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But those who
believe love Allah (more than anything else).” (Quran 2:165)
(2)
Shirk
in supplication.  First, supplication
or invocation (known as
du’a
in Arabic) is part of worship as the
Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Supplication is the essence of worship.” (
Abu
Daud, Al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad
)
Calling upon dead saints, righteous men or those who are
absent and far away for help and assistance as Allah should have been prayed to
is greater
shirk
.  It includes praying, invoking or supplicating to a
false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides Allah.  Christians
pray to a man, the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, whom they claim to have been God
incarnate.  Catholics pray to saints, angels, and Mary as the “mother of God.”  It
is also
shirk
to pray to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings
of Allah be upon him, or to deceased holy men believing that they can answer prayers,
as Allah says,
“Say: ‘Behold, I have been forbidden to worship those whom you
invoke instead of Allah.’” (Quran 6:56)
“And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits
you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.”
(Quran 10:106)
“If you pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they
heard they could not grant it you.  On the Day of Resurrection they will disown
association with you.  None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.” (Quran 35:14)
(3)
Shirk
in obedience.  Allah is the only
Ruler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver
[2]
,
the Absolute Judge, and the Legislator.  He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just
like the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the
moral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from
wrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,
determine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human
interaction and behavior.  His is the command:
“His is the Creation and Command.” (7:54)
“Legislation is not but for Allah.  He has commanded that you
worship not except Him.  That is the correct religion, but most of the people
do not know.” (Quran 12:40)
Obeying religious leaders in matters of clear
disobedience to Allah is a form of greater
shirk
as Allah says:
“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and
their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)
They made partners unto Allah not by directly praying to
them, but by willfully accepting their rabbis and clergy changing the lawful
into prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave
their religious men the authority only Allah has - to set the divine law.  For
example, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church has the authority to determine
how God is t"

Shirk
- a word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
·
Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved
.
·
Ummah
- Refers to the whole Muslim
community, irrespective of color, race, language or nationality.
·
Riyaa
– It comes from the word
ra’aa
meaning to see, to behold, to view. Thus the word
riyaa
means showing
off, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically
riyaa
means to perform
acts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than
Allah.
Definition of Lesser
Shirk
Lesser
Shirk
is what has been specifically called
shirk
in the Quran and
Sunnah
, but does not reach the level of greater
shirk
.  
Also, lesser
shirk
is said to lead to greater
shirk
.   Some
scholars have said lesser
shirk
is so vast that it is difficult to
define it precisely.   The most important examples of lesser
shirk
are:
Charms & Omens
Wearing charms, talismans, and amulets for protection
against the evil eye, bad luck and the like thinking that Allah has placed
these powers in them constitute lesser
shirk
.  This is discussed in more
detail
here
.
Swearing an Oath in the Name of Other than Allah
Taking an oath, or swearing, in the name of someone
other than Allah is a type of lesser
shirk
given that a person does not
intend to venerate the one in whose name the oath is being taken, else it turns
into greater
shirk
.   The Messenger of Allah, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said,
“The one who takes an oath in the name of other
than Allah commits disbelief or
shirk
.”
[1]
Riyaa
(Showing-Off)
The Messenger of Allah said:
“The thing that I fear most for you is lesser
shirk
.”
They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is lesser
shirk
?”
 He said:
“
Riyaa
(showing off), for Allah will say on
the Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom
you were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find
with them.’” (
Ahmad
)
Riyaa
is to perform worship in order to be seen
and praised by people.
Riyaa
renders a deed void; the person earns sin
instead of reward from Allah, and it exposes him to punishment.
Human beings, by nature like to be praised, are not fond
of criticism, and do not like to be seen deficient in any way.   Islam views doing
religious acts to impress others instead of pleasing Allah - what should have
been done for Allah is done for people - as
shirk
.   The Messenger of
Allah said:
“Allah (glorified and exalted be He) said: ‘I am so
self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate.  Thus he who does
an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action
renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.’” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
There is a good chance of a believer falling into
riyaa
because it is hidden, it sits in the heart, pollutes the intention, and a
person has to be extremely vigilant to correct it.  Ibn Abbas, one of the
Prophet’s companions, said,
“
Shirk
in the Muslim nation is more hidden
than a black ant crawling on a black stone in the middle of a moonless night.”
[2]
Intention is a simple matter, but sometimes changing it
can be difficult.   A person has to listen to their heart and see what motivates
a certain action.  A Muslim has to carefully watch his intention to keep it
pure whenever he performs a good deed like
salah
(ritual prayer), giving
charity, fasting, serving his parents, or even smiling.  Perhaps this is why
the saying of Allah’s Name has been prescribed before all acts of importance in
daily life – eating, drinking, sleeping, going to the toilet, waking up, and
going to sleep.  Remembering Allah keeps the heart aware of Allah and the
intention pure.
Let us understand with simple examples how
riyaa
may affect worship:
(a)  Let us say the basic motive when you stand up
to pray is for people to see you, or notice you are praying, wishing to be praised. 
This invalidates the act of worship.
(b)  Let us say you started off to pray with
sincerity, your intention was to pray for Allah, but then you started thinking
about pleasing people, and slowly your intention changed.  You do one of the
two things.  If you resist the temptation of getting noticed, it will not have
any effect on you because the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said:
“Allah has forgiven my ummah "

Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
Allah Created Everything
So how does it all start? Allah.  Nothing else.  The
Prophet of Islam was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, where was our Lord before He
created His creation?” He said: “Nothing existed but Him, with nothing beneath
Him and nothing above Him.”
[1]
Think about how amazing that is, basically it tells us
that there is nothing but Allah that is truly worthy; creation needs Allah and
nothing else because in the beginning there was Allah while there was nothing
else.
Allah says in the Quran:
“Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the Guardian
over all things.” (Quran 39:62)
So everything besides Allah was created by Him, is under
His dominion and His disposal, and He brought it into existence.
Jubayr, a contemporary of Prophet Muhammad describes
himself, saying, “I was one of the greatest enemies of the Prophet,” and he
said, “I hated him more than any other human being on the face of this earth,”
but then something strange happened.   “One time I walked into the mosque and I
heard the Prophet reciting verses from
Surah
at-Toor (Quran 52:35-36),
‘Were they created from absolutely nothing or are they themselves suggesting
that they are the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth?
Rather they have absolutely no idea, they are at confusion!’”
Jubayr says that at that moment when the Prophet said
that, even though he wouldn't officially accept Islam until later on in his life,
“faith entered my heart.   I knew at that point that there is absolutely no way
that there is no God!”
If you just sit with yourself and you go through the
process of elimination of the possibilities of how we and everything else
around us is here, you will find that there is no other way to explain it
except by Allah.
Creation of Water and the Throne (
Arsh
)
Prophet Muhammad said: “Nothing existed but Him,
with nothing beneath Him and nothing above Him.   Then He created His Throne
above the water.”
[2]
The Prophet tells us that there was Allah first and
nothing else.   Then, He created the water and the Throne (
Arsh
).   They
were created independent of any angels and were created before the creation of the
heavens and the earth.   Prophet Muhammad said, “There was Allah, and there was
nothing else besides Him, and His Throne was over the wat0er.   He wrote all
things in the Book (in heaven) and He created the heavens and the eart0h.”
[3]
All stars,
planets, galaxies comes under the “first heaven” (
As-sama ad-dunya
).
God mentions many times in the Quran that He is the Lord
of the Glorious Throne, because it is one of the foremost and most magnificent
of his creations.
Description
of the Throne
1.  Allah Created His Throne Above Water
Allah said, “
And
He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne
was on the water.”
(Quran 11:7)
2.  Throne is the Roof of Paradise
The Prophet said:
“If you ask Allah, then ask him the (Paradise of)
Firdaws
,
for it is in the highest point of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the
Most Merciful, and from it burst the rivers of Paradise.”
[4]
3.  Throne is Above the Heavens & Above
All Creation
Abdullah Ibn Masud, a Companion of the
Prophet, said, “Between the lowest heaven and the one after it is the distance
of five hundred years, and between every two heavens is the distance of five
hundred years, and between the seventh heaven and the
Kursi
is the
distance of five hundred years, and between the
Kursi
and the water is
the distance of five hundred years, and the Throne (
Arsh
) is above the
water.  Allah the Almighty is above the Throne.  And nothing is hidden from
Allah of your deeds.”
[5]
4.  Throne has Pillars
The Prophet said:
“The people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection
and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold, I will find Musa
clinging to one of the pillars of the Throne.  Then I will not know whether he
regained consciousness before me or he has been exempted because of his
unconsciousness at the mountain of Toor (at Sinai).”
[6]
)
5.  Angels Who Carry It
Allah said:
“Those
(angels) who bear the Throne and those around it glorify the praises of their
Lord.”
(Quran 40:7)
He also said:
“And
the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the
Throne of your Lord above them.”
(Quran 69:17)
Moreover, Allah talks about the great angels that carry
the Throne.  They are huge magnificent creatures from the best of Allah’s
angels.  On the Day of Judgement, Allah tells us there will be eight angels
that will bear His Throne (Quran 69:17).  The Prophet said, “I was permitted to
speak about one of the angels of Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, who is
one of the"

- A creation of Allah that was

The Pen
After the creation of the water and the Throne, God
created the Pen.  When the Prophet says that God created the Pen, he says that
His Throne was settled upon water, that there was a layer of water under the
Throne of God.
“God ordained the measures of the creation fifty thousand
years before He created the heavens and the earth while His Throne was over the
water.”
[1]
What are the dimensions of the Pen?  How does it look?  We
have absolutely no idea.
The Prophet said, “God said to the Pen: ‘Write.’ It
said: ‘O Lord, what should I write?’ He said: ‘Write down the decrees of all
things until the Hour begins.’”
[2]
The Preserved Tablet (
Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
)
The Pen, which was created 50,000 years before the
heavens and the earth, wrote in what’s known as
al-Lawh al-Mahfuz
, the
Preserved Tablet.  God calls it
al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
because it’s protected
from any changes and is also protected from access.  Everything is within that
Book, even, as God tells us, a leaf falling from the tree.  Everything that
would have happened, that has happened, and will happen is written there.
What it does is it establishes the trust of a believer
in Allah that what He wrote was written for our good, and that everything
happens for a wisdom.  Sometimes we can figure it out, but at other times we
are comforted and content knowing that God knows what He is doing.
Heavens and Earth
Referring to what scientists call the Big Bang today,
the Quran says,
“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and
the earth were joined together as one piece, then We parted them and We have
made from water every living thing? Will they not then believe?”
(Quran
21:30)
Based on the following verse, some scholars state that Allah
created the heavens before He created the earth,
“Are you more difficult to
create or is the heaven that He constructed.  He raised its height, and has
perfected it.  Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.  And after
that He spread the earth.  And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. 
And the mountains He has fixed firmly, as provision and benefit for you and
your cattle.”
(Quran 79:27-30)
Allah says in the Quran,
“Indeed, your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the
earth in six days.” (Quran 7:54)
Allah really does not need six days, God could simply
have said, “Be,” and it would have come into existence.  Why would God create
in six days as opposed to just one second or less? Perhaps, God wanted to teach
us one of the beloved qualities to Him, which is to take things slowly and
planning them out properly.
Seas, Rivers, & Rain
Allah tells us that He is the One who created the
heavens and the earth, sent down rain from the sky, producing fruits and
sustenance for our survival.  Allah provided for us seas and ships to sail
through these seas.  He put the rivers at our service and placed the sun and
the moon in their circuits.  He put for our service the night and the day.  Allah
says that He gave us everything that we need to survive.  If we were to try to
count the blessings of Allah, we would not be able to do so (see Quran
14:32-34).
The earth benefits us in innumerable ways.   If you look
at the surface of the earth, Allah says He made it special for us, meaning that
it is ease to tread.  Now imagine if the surface of the earth was all like
mountains and we all had to live in regions that were rough and difficult to
walk.  He made the surface soft so we can dig into it and plant things.  But at
the same time, He made the earth stable and firm enough to allow construction
and building from its materials.  He also created gravity so we’re not just
flying all over the place.
Sun & Moon
The sun is a magnificent creation of Allah and you will
find that Allah swears by the sun in Chapter Ash-Shams in order to bestow
greater appreciation for this gift that He gave us.  Many religions in the past
assigned special qualities to the sun; a lot of people worshipped the sun.  Allah
says,
“And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. 
Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostate to God, who created
them, if you [really] worship Him.” (Quran 41:37)
With the sun, moon, and the stars you have a lot of
superstitions and even rational human beings will have these very strange
superstitions.  People often put logic aside when it comes to superstitions. 
You have astrology, horoscopes and other similar things that make absolutely no
sense, but they give people either hope that’s not really there or they give
people a reason for t"

Hadith
- (plural –

) is
a piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
The human mind is a true marvel, but in certain areas it
is limited.  Allah is different from anything the human mind can think of or
imagine.  Therefore, if the mind tries to picture Allah, certain aspects will
be ambiguous and open to indefinite interpretation.  Nevertheless, it is
possible to understand the attributes of Allah which do not require making any
mental pictures.  For example, one of Allah’s names is
al-Ghaffar
, which
means ‘Oft-Forgiver’.  Everyone can understand this easily because that is how
the human mind can clearly think of Allah.  Jewish and Christian teachings on
God are confused partly because of their incorrect understanding of this issue. 
The Jewish Torah teaches God is like man:
“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness…so God made man in His own image.’ (Genesis 1:26-27)
Moreover, certain Christians put statues or images of an
old white bearded man depicting God in their churches.  Some of these were  produced
by the likes of Michelangelo, who depicted the Face and Hand ‘of God’ – a tough
looking old man - in paintings.
Rendering images of God in Islam is an impossibility,
and amounts to disbelief, as Allah tells us in the Quran that nothing resembles
Him:
“There is nothing like Him, but He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.”
(Quran 42:11)
“There is nothing comparable to Him.” (Quran 112:4)
The Request of Moses to See Allah
Eyes can not grasp Allah, He tells us in the Quran:
“Vision cannot grasp Him, but He his grasp is over all vision.”
(Quran 6:103)
Moses, to whom God spoke and gave great miracles, was
chosen by Allah to be His Prophet.  It is said, that Moses thought that, since
Allah used to speak to him, he might be able to actually see Allah if he asked. 
The story is in the Quran, where Allah tells us what happened:
“And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord
spoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show me (Yourself) that I may look at You.’  (Allah)
said, ‘You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in
place, then you will see Me.’  But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He
rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious.  And when he awoke, he said,
‘Exalted are You!  I have repented to You, and I am the first of the
believers.’” (Quran 7:143)
Allah made it clear that no one, including the great
prophet Moses, can bear the sight of the divine, for Allah is too great to be grasped
by human eyes in this life.  According to the Quran, Moses realized his request
was in error; therefore, he sought forgiveness from Allah for having even
thought to ask.
The Prophet Muhammad Did Not See Allah in This Life
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, traveled in a miraculous journey through the heavens to meet Allah. 
People thought that since Prophet Muhammad spoke to Allah in that journey, he
probably saw Allah too.  One of the companions, Abu Dharr, asked him about it. 
The Prophet replied:
“There was only light, how could I see Him?’
[1]
What was the light he saw?  The Prophet explained:
“Surely, Allah does not sleep nor is it befitting
for Him to sleep.  He is the one who lowers the scales and raises them.  The
deeds of the night go up to Him before the deeds of the day and those of the
day before those of the night, and His veil is the light.”

Vision of God in Spiritual Experiences
Some people, including some who claim to be Muslims,
report spiritual experiences where they have claimed to have seen God.  Common
reported experiences also include seeing lights, or a magnificent being seated
on a throne.  Such an experience is usually accompanied by dropping basic
Islamic practices like
salah
and fasting, under the mistaken opinion
that such practices are only for common people who had not had their type of
experience.
One of the fundamental foundations of Islam is that the
law revealed to Prophet Muhammad cannot be changed or canceled.  God neither
makes lawful for some what He has made unlawful for others, nor does He communicate
His Law thro"

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
·
Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a
direct connection between the believer and Allah.  More specifically, in Islam
it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
The Merciful Creator describes Himself in the Quran, and
the Prophet has described His Lord in the
Sunnah
, because human
intellect is limited and cannot fathom the limitless scope of the divine.  Allah
tells us what is necessary for us to know about Himself, helping to prevent
confusion about His being, actions and location.  After all, how can we love
someone we do not know?  Therefore, the Quran and
Sunnah
tell us
everything we need to know in order to worship our Creator.  The divine
attribute of
‘Uluw
, highness or transcendence, is the topic of this
lesson.
Meaning and Significance
The divine attribute
‘Uluw
means Allah is above
His creation, and nothing is above Him.  He is neither within His creation, nor
part of His creation.  Creation cannot encompass Him.  The Creator is
completely separate and distinct from His creation.
Before Islam, Hindus believed God resided in animals,
human beings and countless idols.  The Jewish scripture stated that God came to
earth in the form of a man and wrestled with Prophet Jacob who defeated Him (Genesis
32:24-30).  Christians have claimed that God became flesh and came down to
earth in the form of a man to be crucified.  Some heretics also brought such ideas
into Islam.  For example, Hallaj, a deranged mystic, openly claimed he and
Allah were one.  These deviant ideas have become so widespread that if someone
were to ask many Muslims today, ‘Where is Allah?’ they will say that He is
everywhere.
The main danger of this thought is that it opens the
door to the worship of creation.  If God is everywhere, it means He is in His
creation.  If that is true, then why not worship the creation itself?  It
becomes especially easy for people to start saying God is in their own souls and
accept worship.  Countless kings, ordinary individuals like the Pharaohs of
Egypt and Jesus were so worshipped, though the latter did not accept being
worshipped by his followers.
The Evidence
Allah is not everywhere.  There are five main proofs for
it:
(1)  Islam states that every human being is born
with certain tendencies that are not the result of his environment.  Human
beings are born with a natural realization of a Creator who is separate and
above His creation.  The mere thought of God being in places of filth, which
would be a natural consequence of God being everywhere, is repulsive to human
nature.
(2)  The
salah
prayer must be offered in a
place clear of pictures or statues.  A Muslim is forbidden to bend or prostrate
in worship to any creation.  If Allah were everywhere and in everything, people
could worship other people or themselves.
(3)  Two years before the Prophet, may the mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon him, migrated to Medina from Mecca, he was taken
on a miraculous journey to Mecca to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem up beyond the
seven heavens to meet Allah.  Allah spoke directly to Prophet Muhammad.  There would
have been no need for him to go up beyond the seven heavens to meet Allah if He
were present everywhere.
(4)  Many verses of the Quran tell us clearly that
Allah is above His creation.
The Quran speaks of the angels rising up to Allah:
“They ascend up to Him in a day whose length is like a
thousand years by your reckoning.” (Quran 32:5)
Prayers also rise up to Allah:
“Every good saying goes up to Him.” (Quran 35:10)
Allah describes Himself as above His servants:
“He is the Irresistible One above His creation.” (Quran 6:18,
61)
He describes His worshippers as:
“Those who fear their Lord who is above them.” (Quran 16:50)
One of Allah’s beautiful names is al-Aliy which means, ‘The
Most High’; nothing is above Him.
(5)  A companion of the Prophet, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, named Ibn al-Hakam had a slave who used to tend
his sheep.  One day, he came to see her and found out that a wolf had eaten one
of the sheep from the flock she cared for.  Learning this, he got angry and
slapped her in the face, but later  regretted doing so. So he came to Allah’s
Messenger and told him the story, upon which the Messenger asked him to bring
her.
When
she came, the Prophet asked her,
‘Where is Allah?’
She answered, ‘Above
the sky.’  The Prophet asked her,
‘Who am I?’
She said, ‘You are the
Messenger of Allah.’  He said,
‘Free her, for she is a believer.’

.  I begin with the
name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  This is a phrase that we
say every day, several times per day.  However sometimes we forget how mighty a
phrase it is and we forget that mercy is one of His attributes, and that we, as
imperfect human beings, constantly rely upon Allah’s blessings.
Allah is the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful, His
mercy encompasses all things, and is the source of all the compassion and mercy
that exists.
“My Mercy embraces all things...” (Quran 7:156)
In English the word mercy has several meanings including
compassion, forgiveness, kindness, and tenderness.  In Arabic, the term for
mercy is
rahmah
;
Ar-Rahman
and
Ar-Raheem
, two of the most
important names of Allah derive from this root word.  The Mercy of Allah is
that ethereal quality that also embodies gentleness, care, consideration, love
and forgiveness.   When these qualities are observable in this world, they are
a mere reflection of Allah’s mercy towards His creation.
Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him, informed us that
Allah is more merciful to His slaves than a mother is to her child,
[1]
and in fact,
the Arabic word for womb, is derived from the same root word as mercy -rahmah. 
 This is a sign of the unique connection between Allah’s mercy and the womb.   Allah
nurtures and shelters us, just as the womb nurtures and shelters the unborn
child.  In the Quran, in the authentic Sunnah and throughout the world there
are many signs of Allah’s mercy to His creation.
Some Signs of Allah’s Mercy
·The Prophets and Messengers.
Allah sent Prophets and Messengers to guide us and help
us to remain on His straight path leading to eternal Paradise.  All the
Prophets and Messengers were mortal, human beings, sent to different nations at
different times but proclaimed the same message – to worship One God
and not to associate anything or
anyone with Him
.  They showed the people the best way to live and
lead a life that would give them success and happiness in this life and in the
next.
Prophet Muhammad being the last of them, was sent to all
of humankind.
He was
sent with a message that was suitable for all people, in all places, at all
times
.
Allah describes the Prophet  as
a mercy upon humankind. He, the Exalted, says:
“And We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), except as a mercy to
the worlds.” (Quran 21:107)
Prophet Muhammad was the embodiment of mercy.   He
showed gentleness and compassion to all those he came in contact with; his
family, orphans, friends, slaves, and strangers.
“And by the Mercy of God, you dealt with them gently.   And
had you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about
you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah’s) Forgiveness for them...”
(Quran 3:159)
·The Quran
The Quran is Allah’s greatest gift to humanity – it is a
book like no other.  The Quran guides humankind to high standards of morality
and exhorts them to strive to be the best human beings possible.   Whenever
life becomes too difficult or we are beset by injury, illness or unhappiness, the
Quran will light our way and lighten our burdens.   It is a source of solace
and ease.  It is a mercy to humankind.
“And We have not sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (O
Muhammad), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which
they differ, and (as) a guidance and a
mercy
for a people who believe.”
(Quran 16:64)
“And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent
down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e.  do not disobey His Orders), that you
may receive mercy.”(Quran 6:155)
·Leniencies in matters of worship.
Islam teaches that every
single aspect of life can be an act of worship.  Everything from eating and
drinking to sleeping and going to the bathroom can be done in a way that
pleases Allah.
Islam is a faith that is flexible, lenient and merciful.
For instance, if a believer is sick and cannot fast
during the month of Ramadan, he is not mandated to fast.  In fact he is
encouraged to not fast.  Similarly if a Muslim cannot make the
Hajj
due
to physical or financial difficulties he or "

More signs of Allah’s Mercy
·Rain
While rain can sometimes be a reminder of God’s
punishment, it is a true blessing and a mercy of the highest order.  Without
rain, life as we know it would not exist.  All power and strength is from God
Alone and He reminds us of that in the Quran.  God is Almighty, with total
control over rain and its bounties.
“And We sent down from the sky water (rain) in (due) measure…”
(Quran 23:18)
“And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have
despaired, and spreads His Mercy.  And He is the
Wali
, Worthy of all
Praise.” (Quran 42:28)
·Life everlasting in Paradise.
It is the mercy of Allah that will admit the believers into
Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.  No one will ever enter Paradise because
of his deeds alone.  Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him, explained that to
his companions saying, “No one’s deeds will ever admit him to Paradise.” They
said, “Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “No, not even me, unless
Allah showers me with His Mercy.
[1]
However it is the good deeds of a person that draws Allah’s Mercy.
Mercy and all it involves is a very important concept in
Islam because from it stems generosity, respect, tolerance and forgiveness; all
qualities that a Muslim is expected to cultivate in this life.  Because of this
Islam places great emphasis on developing the qualities of compassion,
sympathy, forgiveness, and love.   Both the Quran and the
Sunnah
of
Prophet Muhammad display and encourage these ideals.  Allah blesses Muslims who
are kind to others and dislikes behaviour that is hard hearted or cruel.  Consequently
Prophet Muhammad could often be heard invoking God’s Mercy on the believers.
Mercy & Forgiveness
Allah’s mercy should never be underestimated and the qualities
of mercy and forgiveness are linked together throughout the Quran and the
authentic traditions - the
Sunnah
- of Prophet Muhammad.  Allah asks us
to seek forgiveness from Him and Prophet Mohammad reminded us that God forgives
when we turn to Him.   In the last part of the night, when darkness lies
heavily across the land, God descends to the lowest heaven and asks His slaves. 
“Who is saying a prayer to Me that I may answer it?  Who is asking something of
Me that I may give it to him?  Who is asking forgiveness of Me that I may
forgive him?”
[2]
“Say, ‘O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves
[by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah.  Indeed, Allah forgives all
sins.  Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’ And return [in
repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you;
then you will not be helped.” (Quran 39: 53 – 54)
Allah created humankind with an inclination to commit
sins and make mistakes, however when a person repents he or she is able to see
and experience Allah’s divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness.  Prophet
Muhammad said, “If you did not commit sins, Allah would wipe you out of
existence and replace with another people who would commit sins and in turn
seek Allah’s forgiveness.
[3]
Falling into error, realizing the mistake, and seeking Allah’s forgiveness
whilst hoping for His mercy, is spiritual growth that develops a person’s love
for Allah.  Allah loves those who constantly turn to Him seeking forgiveness.
Although Allah is eager for all human beings to turn to Him
and ask forgiveness, and although His mercy is vast and all-encompassing, this
is not a license to commit sins.  In order for a person to feel the mercy of
Allah and be forgiven for his or her transgressions, the conditions of
repentance should be fulfilled
[4]
. 
Then and only then will the mercy of Allah descend.
The mercy of Allah is made manifest when Allah counts
the sin of the sinner as one sin.  It is further manifested when Allah rewards
the righteous person ten times what his good deed is worth and then Allah may multiply
his reward even more than ten times.  “Allah ordered (the appointed angels over
you) that the good and the bad deeds be written, and He then showed (the way)
how (to write).  If someone intends to do a good deed and he does not do it,
then Allah will write for him a full good deed; and if he intends to do a good
deed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him (its reward equal) from
ten to seven hundred times to many more times.  And If someone intends to do a
bad deed and he does not do it, then Allah will write for him a full good deed
(in his account) with Him, and if he intends to do a bad deed and actually did
it, then Allah will write for him one bad deed.”
[5]
Also, Allah erases sins with each good deed performed.

deeds r"

Tawheed
– The Oneness and Uniqueness

right to be worshipped.
·
Shirk
– a word that
implies ascribing partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other
than Allah, or believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes
from another besides Allah.
·
Tiyarah
– Taking omen through bird’s
movements or things.
An omen is defined as a sign portending a future event. 
Some omens are taken as signs of good fortune while others are interpreted as a
sign of impending evil.  Many superstitions in the name of good and bad omens
are widespread in the world, and a Muslim should have a clear understanding as to
how it affects their belief.  Omens are not meaningless little things people
just believe in; rather, they are based on pagan, non-Islamic ideas.  One
should keep in mind that idolatry did not appear overnight.  Rather, such
superstitions first take root and open the door to the worship of idols, human
gods, and stars.  Slowly people forget the pure teachings of their prophets –
tawheed
- and mixed them with superstitions.  Islam closes all such doors and uproots
every superstition that can destroy the simple, pure belief in
tawheed
.
The following are a few examples of numerous widespread omens:
(1)  Breaking a mirror means suffering seven years
of bad luck: before the invention of mirrors, man would gaze at his reflection,
perceived as his ‘other self’, in pools, ponds, and lakes. If the image was
distorted, it was taken as a sign of impending disaster. Thus the ‘unbreakable’
metal mirrors of the early Egyptians and Greeks were valued items because of
their magical properties (such as possessing undistorted reflecting properties).
After glass mirrors were introduced, the Romans took the broken mirror as a
sign of bad luck, since each piece reflected and multiplied their ‘other self’.
The length of the prescribed misfortune came from the Roman belief that man's
body was physically rejuvenated every 7 years, and he became, in effect, a new
man.
(2) Knocking on wood: the ancient belief that
spirits either dwelled in, or guarded trees.  Greeks worshipped the oak as it
was sacred to Zeus, Celts believed in tree spirits, and both believed touching
sacred trees would bring good fortune.  Irish lore holds that ‘touching wood’ is
a way to thank the leprechauns for a bit of luck.  Pagans also held similar
beliefs of protective tree spirits.  Chinese and Koreans thought the spirits of
mothers who died in childbirth remained in nearby trees.  Another explanation
points to the wooden Christian cross as the origin of  ‘good luck,’ although
this is likely a Christian adaptation of earlier pagan practices.
(3)  The inadvertent spilling of salt is believed
to be followed by misfortune, so it is deliberately spilled, or cast, over the
left shoulder to counter it.  Superstitions about salt date back to biblical
times when salt was a highly prized commodity.  It was expensive, crucial in
preserving food, and was often used in place of currency.  So spilling salt was
considered an almost sacrilegious offence, and left one exposed to the devil's
machinations.  Throwing salt over your shoulder is thought to be a way of
keeping the devil at bay while you are in especially vulnerable.  The salt is
either intended to blind the devil so he can not witness your error, or keep
him from sneaking up on you while you are cleaning up the mess.
(4)  Friday 13
th
: Western culture has
considered Friday 13th particularly unlucky for hundreds of years.  The 13
th
floor in many high-rise buildings in America is called the 14
th
floor.  The sixth day of the week has often been considered unlucky, as has the
number 13.  The combination, which occurs one to three times a year, leads inevitably
to this reinforced superstition.
People
avoid traveling on this day. Some say the number 13 was purposely vilified by
the priests of patriarchal religions because it represented femininity.  Thirteen
corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year, and the
number was revered in prehistoric goddess-worshipping cultures.  Hindus
believed that it was unlucky for 13 people to gather in one place.  This
conviction was shared by the ancient Scandinavians.  Many biblical events of
negative import supposedly occurred on a Friday, including the ejection of Adam
and Eve from the Garden of Eden, the start of the Great Flood, and the purported
crucifixion of Jesus.
Islamic Ruling on Omens
Before Islam the Arabs used to consider the direction in
which birds flew to be a sign of good or bad omen.  If a person set out on a
journey and saw a bird fly over"

·
Ruqyah
– spells.
For thousands of years people have tried to bring good
luck and avert bad luck from them and their property by employing charms,
amulets, and talismans.  A charm is a practice or expression believed to have
magic power, similar to an incantation or a spell.
[1]
A talisman is an object bearing a sign or engraved character, and thought to
act as a charm to avert evil and bring good fortune.
[2]
Amulets were used to protect man, or his possessions, such as houses and
cattle from the evil influences of witches, demons, and other mischievous
powers, or to counteract misfortune and illness.  The amulet is found both in
the Orient and in the West, among tribes and nations down to the present day.  Assyrians
and Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, Jews and Christians, fostered this ancient
superstition, and, in varying degrees, foster it today.
[3]
Despite technical and scientific advancements, superstitions and amulets continue
to pervade the Western society.  Some of the amulets popular in the West are:
(1)  A horseshoe.  The most commonly encountered
lucky charm in modern North America is the horseshoe and its representative
models in the form of jewelry, wall hangings, and printed images.  The use of
worn-out horseshoes as magically protective amulets - especially hung above or
next to doorways - originated in Europe, where one can still find them nailed
onto houses, barns, and stables from Italy through Germany and up into Britain
and Scandinavia.
(2)  The four-leaf clover.  The four-leaf clover is
among the commonest of North American lucky emblems and is an especially
frequent image on good luck coins, and good luck postcards.
(3)  The wishbone or “merry thought.”  The wishbone
is the third most popular American amulet, next only to the horseshoe and the
four-leaf clover.  It is a bone overlying the breastbone of fowl, as in a chicken,
or turkey.  It is the custom to save this bone intact when carving the bird at
dinner and to dry it over the stove or by the fire until it is brittle.  Once
dry, it is given to two people, who pull it apart until it cracks, each one making
a wish while doing so.  The person who gets the “long half” of the wishbone
will have his or her wish “come true.”  If the wishbone breaks evenly, both
parties get their wishes.
(4)  The Rabbit’s Foot.
(5)  Charm bracelets.
(6)  Good Luck coins or ‘pocket pieces.’
(7)  The Lucky or Smiling Buddha commonly found in Oriental
shops and restaurants.
The Crucifix.  When blessed, it is considered an important
sacramental.
Hebrew Amulets: Grape-Leaf Star of David pendant.  One of
its ancient uses was as a magical Kabalistic symbol.
Charms & Amulets in Pre-Islamic Arabia
Arabian amulets (
tameemah
in Arabic) are made
from pearls or bones that are worn on the necks of children or adults, or are
hung up in houses or cars, in order to ward off evil – especially the evil eye
– or to bring some benefits.  The Arabs in the time of Prophet Muhammad, may
the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to wear arm bracelets,
bangles, beaded necklaces, shells, and similar amulets to bring good luck or
avert bad fortune.
Islamic Ruling on Amulets
Allah is the sole Lord and Ruler of the physical world. 
‘Lord’ means He is the Creator and controls all affairs in the universe; the
Kingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs exclusively to Him, and He owns them. 
He alone brought existence out of non-existence and it depends on Him for its
conservation and continuance.  His power is required at every moment to sustain
all creatures.  Angels, prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant
kingdoms are under His control.  Only Allah knows what the future holds.  Good
luck and bad fortune are from Allah alone.
Faith in charms, amulets, and talismans contradict
belief in Allah’s Lordship by attributing the ability to bring good luck or
avert bad fortune to these created brings whereas only Allah can bring good and
avert harm.  Consequently, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, opposed these superstitious practices and taught people to have firm
belief in their Lord, rather than amulets, which cannot change what Allah has
destined and can bring no good fortune to anyone.  Even though they are not
capable of averting any harm, belief in amulets usually leads to idolatry over
time.  This can be s"

The essential teachings of Islam
are based on five principles, referred to as the ‘Five Pillars of Islam’, and
six fundamental beliefs, known as the ‘Six Articles of Faith.’ This division is
based on the following well known
hadith
of Prophet Muhammad, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. Umar, one of the closest of companions
to the Prophet, related the following occurrence:
“Once, while we were
sitting with the Prophet, a man appeared before us whose clothes were
exceedingly white and hair exceedingly black.  No signs of traveling were seen
on him and no one among us knew him.  He sat towards the Prophet, resting his
knees against his knees and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs. He then
said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’
The Messenger replied: ‘Islam
is to testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the compulsory
charity (
zakah
), to fast in
Ramadan
, and to make the pilgrimage
to the House if you are able to do so.’
He said: ‘You have spoken the
truth.’
We were amazed at him
asking questions and then saying he had spoken the truth!
He then inquired: ‘Tell me
about faith (
Imaan
)?’
The Prophet replied: ‘It
is to believe in Allah, His angels, His scriptures, His messengers, and the
Last Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its sweetness and its bitterness.’
He said: ‘You have spoken the
truth.’
Umar then related some more
questions he asked and the answers given by the Prophet.  Finally, when the man
left, the Prophet asked:
‘O ‘Umar, do you know who
was the questioner?’
I said: ‘Allah and His
Messenger know best.’
The Prophet said: ‘It was
Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.’”
[1]
The Meaning of ‘Islam’
The Arabic word
‘Islam
’
means to submit, a total surrender, a total resignation to God.  Therefore, a
‘Muslim’ is ‘one who submits to God.’ Islam means to submit to Allah alone, to
worship and serve Allah alone, and to believe and follow the prophet sent to
them.  To many non-Muslims, ‘Islam’ is a religion that began in the seventh
century in the Middle East, but to Muslims, Islam has always been the only
religion of Allah since the time of Adam, the first man.  Thus, Islam was the
religion of all prophets who came after him.  In the time of Moses, Islam was
to worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings Moses had brought,
and Islam in the time of Jesus was to worship Allah alone and believe and
follow the teachings Jesus had brought, as they were both prophets sent by God
to teach his religion.  After the coming of Prophet Muhammad, Islam is to
worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.
Although the teachings of all the prophets about God, the Afterlife, and all
other realities of belief were the same, there were slight differences in the
methods of practice, worship and service, for each prophet was sent to a
specific nation and specific period of time. Even though previous religions
come under the general heading of Islam, the religion of Muhammad has specifically
been given the name ‘Islam’ by God, as it is the final religion prescribed for
humanity until the Day of Judgment.
The Five Pillars of Islam
Allah has mandated five acts upon
which the whole religion of Islam is built. Due to their importance, the
Prophet stated in another
hadith
:
“Islam has been built upon
five…”
…and
then proceeded to mention the same acts of worship described in the
hadith
of Gabriel above.
These acts
of worship are called the Pillars of Islam, and they are as follows:

The Six Articles of Faith
Faith is referred to in Arabic
as
Imaan
.  It represents firm belief in the heart, and not simply
blind faith. Islamic doctrine revolves around six aspects described by the
Prophet.
1. Belief in Allah
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief in Allah’s
existence.
(ii)  Allah is the Lord.
He is the Creator, the Provider, the Sustainer, and the Owner of the entire
universe. None has any share in these roles.
(iii) Allah is the only
being entitled to worship. No worship, service or veneration is to be offered
to others besides Allah or along with Him, whether they be prophets, priests,
saints, angels, idols, or stones.
(iv) Allah has the most
beautiful and perfect of names and attributes, which none can be compared to. He
is Unique, separate and unlike His creation. No evil or deficiency can be
attributed to Him.
2. Belief in the Angels
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief in the existence
of angels, a creation of Allah.
(ii)  Belief that they
have no right to receive any form of worship
(iii) Belief in the names by
which the angels are identified in the Quran and
Sunnah
(teachings of
Prophet Muhammad).
(iv) Belief in the special
tasks assigned to each of them by Allah in the Quran and
Sunnah
(teachings of Prophet Muhammad).
3. Belief in the Revealed Scriptures
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief that Allah
revealed scriptures to various prophets.
(ii)  Belief that they
contained the truth from Allah.
(iii) Belief that all
previous scriptures other than the Quran have been altered.
(iv) Belief in the Quran has
several aspects:
a)
Belief that it is one of the scriptures of Allah.
b)
Belief that it is the Final Revelation to humanity, and that no other scripture
will be revealed after it.
c)
Belief that everything in it is true, containing no falseness.
d)
Belief that it has remained unchanged, and will remain so for eternity.
e)
Belief that it has abrogated all previous scriptures before it.
4. Belief in the Messengers
, which entails the following:
(i)    Belief that Allah sent prophets to every nation, calling them
to worship and obey Allah Alone. One must believe in all of them, known or
unknown, without rejecting any of them.
(ii)   Belief that they were the best of humanity, chosen due to
their virtuousness.
(iii)  Belief that they were mere humans, not divine in any way, and
that they do not have any right to receive worship, nor did they claim so.
(iv)  Belief that they merely conveyed the message from Allah and
did not legislate from their own selves.
(v)   Belief that they did not err in conveying the message.
(vi)  Belief that obedience to them is a must.
(vi)  Belief that Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, was a prophet, which entails those issues discussed in the lesson
entitled
The Testimony of Faith
.
5. Belief in Life after Death and
the Final Day of Judgment, which
entails the following:
(i)   Belief that a day
will come when everything will come to an end, and Allah will raise the
creation and judge them according to their deeds.
(ii) Belief that those who
believed and practically followed the correct religion by following the
prophets will enter Paradise for eternity, and that those who disbelieved will
enter the Hellfire for eternity.
6.       Belief in Divine Decree
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief that Allah’s
Foreknowledge is all inclusive and complete. He has always known everything
that would or would not happen, even before the creation of mankind.
(ii)  Belief that Allah
has recorded everything that was going to occur until the Day of Judgment in a book
known as “The Mother of the Books” or “The Preserved Tablet”.
(iii) Belief that whatever
Allah willed has occurred, is occurring, and will occur. Nothing occurs against
or without this Will.
(iv) Allah created
everything.
We have mentioned here the
minimal requirements of faith in each of these six categories that Muslims
believe in, as the Prophet mentioned that these articles form the basis of Islamic
belief and faith.

·To understand the categories of
Tawheed

Arabic Terms
·
Tawheed
– The Oneness and
Uniqueness of Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and
in His right to be worshipped.
·
Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or

·
Shirk
– a word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
Belief in Allah, the proper name in Arabic of
the one and only God, consists of four matters:
(a)  Belief in Allah’s existence.
(b)  Allah is the Lord.
(c)  Allah is entitled to worship.
(d)  Allah is known by His Most Beautiful
Names and Attributes.
(a)    Belief in Allah’s Existence
It is not required that Allah’s existence be
proven by scientific, mathematical, or philosophical arguments.  His existence
is not a ‘discovery’ to be made by the scientific method or a mathematical
theorem to be proven.  Every human being has an innate belief in a Creator.  This
belief is not a result of learning or personal deductive thinking.  It is outside
influences that effect this innate belief and confuse a person as the Prophet
said:
“There is no child who is not born with a
natural belief in Allah, but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian or a
Magian.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Also, mere common sense bears witness to Allah’s
existence.  From a ship one learns of the ship-builder, from the cosmos one
learns of its Creator.  Allah’s existence is also known by answers to prayers, the
miracles of prophets, and the teachings of all revealed scriptures.
(b)    Allah is the Lord
Allah is the only Lord of heaven and earth.  He
is the Lord of the physical universe and the Lawgiver for human life.  He is
the Master of the physical world and Ruler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the
Lord of every man, woman, and child.
(i)   Allah is the sole Lord and Ruler of
the physical world.  The term ‘Lord’ here specifically means that He is the
Creator, Controller; the Kingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs
exclusively to Him, and He owns them.  He alone brought existence out of
non-existence and all depend on Him for their conservation and continuance.  He
did not create the universe and leave it to pursue its own course according to
fixed laws and cease to take any further interest in it.  His power is required
at every moment to sustain all creatures.  Creation has no Lord besides Him.
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky
and the earth?  Or who owns hearing and sight?  And who brings out the living
from the dead and brings out the dead from the living?  And who disposes the
affairs?’  They will say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s
punishment (for setting up rivals with Allah)?’” (Quran 10:31)
He is the ever-ruling King and the Savior, the
Living God, full of wisdom.  No one can change His decisions.  Angels,
prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant kingdoms are under His control. 
Historically, few people have denied the existence of the Lord; throughout ages
people for most part have believed in One God, a Supreme Being, a supernatural
Creator.
(ii)  Allah is the only Ruler of the
affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver
[1]
,
the Absolute Judge, the Legislator, He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just
like the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the
moral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from
wrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,
determine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human
interaction and behavior.  His is the command:
“His is the Creation and Command.” (Quran 7:54)
(c) Allah is Entitled to Worship
Allah has the exclusive right to be worshipped
inwardly and outwardly, by one’s actions and by one’s heart.  Not only can no
one be worshipped
apart
from Him, absolutely no one else can be
worshipped
along
with
Him.  He has no partners or associates in
worship.  Worship, in its comprehensive sense and in all its aspects, is for
Him alone.
“There is no true god worthy of worship but He, the
Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.” (Quran 2:163)
Allah’s right to be worshipped can not be over
emphasized.  It is the essential meaning of
Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah
.  A
non-Muslim enters Islam by testifying to Allah’s sole right to be worshipped.  It
is the crux of Islamic belief in Allah, even all of Islam.  It was the central
message of all prophets and messengers sent by Allah.  They all declared
clearly:
“Worship Allah!  You have no other god but Him.” (Quran 7:59, 11: 50, 23:32)
It was the central message of Abraham, Isaac,
Ishmael, Moses, the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, and Muhamma"

Du’a
- supplication, prayer, asking
Allah for something.
·
Riyaa
– It comes from the word
ra’aa
meaning to see, to behold, to view. Thus the word
riyaa
means showing
off, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically
riyaa
means to perform
acts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than
Allah.
The Arabic word
shirk
is the opposite of
tawheed
,
Allah’s oneness, and is more inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.  It means
associating Allah with other deities.
Shirk
is to associate others with
Allah in certain aspects designated as unique to Him and exclusively His in the
Quran and
Sunnah
.
There is no issue upon which Islam is so strict
as the one of monotheism (
tawheed
). Associating partners with God (
shirk
)
is the deadliest sin, the greatest violation with which the Lord of the heavens
and the earth may be defied.  Death in the state of
shirk
permanently severs
a person from divine grace:
“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner be set with
Him (i.e.  the sin of
shirk
), and forgives all besides that to whom he
pleases.” (Quran 4:48)
Shirk
has many forms, some of which will
be discussed below.
The Greater
Shirk
Acts which fall under this category of
shirk
are regarded as unforgivable. Allah will not forgive them unless one repents.
“Verily, Allah does not forgive
shirk
, but He
forgives other than that to whom He pleases”
This category contradicts the very purpose of
creation, as expressed in Allah’s statement:
“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship
Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)
In this category of
shirk
, acts of
worship are directed to beings
other than
Allah or
alongside
Him,
as is their rewards.  Allah gives an example of this type in the Quran, in His saying:
“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah,
being sincerely obedient to Him, but when he brings them safe to the land, lo,
they commit
shirk
with Him.” (Quran 29:65)
The Quran stresses in many verses that Allah
does not share His powers with any partner.  It warns those who believe their
idols will intercede for them that they, together with the idols, will become
fuel for Hellfire on the Day of Judgment.
The greater
shirk
includes invoking or
supplicating to a false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides
Allah.  Christians pray to a man who they believe to share divinity with Allah,
the Prophet of Allah Jesus, peace be upon him.  Catholics direct certain types
of worship to saints, angels, and Mary, which they regard as “veneration”. All
these things are regarded as
shirk
.
It is also considered
shirk
to pray to
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, or to
graves of holy men.
Believing in the legislation of others, whether
governments or religious leaders in opposition to the clear teachings of Islam is
also a major form of
shirk
, as Allah says:
“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their
rabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)
They took them as lords besides Allah not by directly
praying to them, but by willfully accepting their changing the lawful into
prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave them
the authority that only Allah has - to legislate in divine law.
Another form of major
shirk
is giving any
creation a portion of divine love reserved for Allah.
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others
besides Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But
those who believe love Allah (more than anything else)...” (Quran 2:165)
Lesser Forms of
Shirk
Swearing by other than Allah and carrying out
religious acts for worldly gain, like showing off or to win favors are two of
the lesser forms of
shirk
.  Allah’s Messenger said:
“The thing I fear for you the most is ‘lesser
shirk
.’ The companions asked ‘Oh!  Messenger of Allah, what is “lesser
shirk
?”
 He replied showing off, for surely Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection
when people are receiving their rewards, ‘Go to those for whom you were showing
off in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.’” (
Ahmad
,
at-Tabarani
,
al-Baihaqi
)

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
Belief in messengers is a required article of Islamic
faith.
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down
to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers.  Each one believes in Allah,
His Angels, His Books, and His messengers.  (They say,) ‘We make no distinction
between one another of His messengers’” (Quran 2:285)
Allah conveys His message to humanity through messengers. 
They form a link between the humans and the heavens, in the sense that Allah
has chosen them to deliver His message to humanity.  Divine messages were not
conveyed to mankind except through the messengers. It is the system of
communication between the Creator and the created.  Allah does not send the angels
to every single individual, nor does He ‘open the skies’ so people can climb up
to receive the message.  His way of communication is through human messengers who
receive the message through the angels. Allah only sent men as prophets and messengers.
No angels were sent with a message to mankind. He, the Exalted, says:
‘And they say, “Why was there not sent down to him an angel?
But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they
would not be reprieved. And if We had made him [i.e. the Messenger] an angel,
We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with
that in which they cover themselves.’ (6:8-9)
What Does the Belief in the Messengers Entail?
Faith in messengers is to firmly believe Allah chose
morally upright men to bear His message and pass it on to humanity.  Blessed
were those who followed them, wretched were those who refused to obey.  They
faithfully delivered the message, without hiding, altering, or corrupting it.  Rejecting
a messenger is rejecting the One who sent him.  Disobeying a messenger is
disobeying the One who commanded to obey him.
Disbelieving in one messenger is like disbelieving in
all the messengers. In the following verse, Allah, the Exalted, says that the
people of Noah disbelieved in all the messengers, even though they were
commanded only to follow Noah:
‘The people of Noah disbelieved in the messengers.’
(Quran 26:105)
More specifically, belief in messengers means:
(1)  Allah sent to every nation a prophet from
amongst them, to call them to worship Allah alone and to shun false gods.
“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our messengers whom We sent
before you: ‘Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most
Merciful (that is Allah)?’” (Quran 43:45)
They did not add or omit anything from the Divine
Message.
“Are the messengers charged with anything but to convey
clearly the Message?” (Quran 16:35)
(2)  Belief in those have been specifically
mentioned, such as Muhammad, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Noah, peace be upon them
all.  We hold a general belief in those not mentioned by name as Allah says:
“And indeed, We have sent messengers before you (O Muhammad); of
some of them We have related to you their story.  And of some We have not
related to you their story” (Quran 40:78)
We believe the final messenger was our Prophet Muhammad
and there is no prophet or messenger after him as Allah has said in the Quran:
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the
Messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.  And Allah is Ever All‑Aware
of everything.” (Quran 33:40)
The Prophet stated categorically:
“There will be no prophet after me.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Previous prophets were sent with laws and commandments
specific to that people in that time. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings
of Allah be upon him, however was sent with a message applicable for all time,
people and places; thus, there is no need for more prophets to come. Another
important reason is that some nations were sent more than one prophet due to the
changes they introduced into the religion. Since God has promised that the
teachings of Prophet Muhammad will never undergo change and will always be preserved
in the original language in their primary sources – the Quran and Sunnah, there
is no need for another prophet.  In the cases of earlier prophets, scriptures were
lost or their message became corrupted to the point that truth was hardly
distinguishable from falsehood.  The message of Prophet Muhammad is clear and
preserved till the end of times.

Belief in Scriptures,https://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/15/belief-in-scriptures,"Islam acknowledges the Quran to be the ‘only’ revealed
scripture which has remained in its original form, despite this, it does not

·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and
Articles of Faith (2 parts).
Objectives
·To understand the purpose of revealing of
scriptures.
·To learn what the ‘Belief in Scriptures’
entails.
·To distinguish between two matters: the
original
Torah, Gospel, and Pslams and the
present day
Bible.
·To appreciate that the Quran is indeed different
from other scriptures in many respects.
Belief in Scriptures is the third article of Islamic
faith.
First, let us look at why they were revealed.
(1)  The scripture revealed to a prophet is a point
of reference to learn the religion and obligations towards Allah and fellow
human beings.  Allah guides human beings by revealing Divine Scriptures through
which they realize the purpose of their creation.
(2)  By referring to it religious disputes and
differences between its followers could be settled.
(3)  The scriptures serve to keep the religion safe
from corruption and deterioration at least for some time after the death of a prophet.
However, the Quran revealed to our Prophet remains safe from corruption till
the end of the time. Allah, the Exalted, says:
‘Indeed, it is We who sent down the message and
indeed, We will be its guardian.’ (15:9)
(4)In
order that Allah’s conclusive argument brought by the messengers against human
beings remains after their death.
“Messengers
as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that humankind should
have no plea against Allah after the messengers. And Allah is Ever All
Powerful, All Wise.” (Quran 4:165)
No one
can plea that the prophets and their messages are no longer in existence as
long as the scriptures are present.
Belief in scriptures entails:
(i)   Allah truly revealed them.
(ii)  Belief in the names of certain scriptures.
(iii) Belief that they contain the truth. As for
the scriptures prior to the Quran, since they have been changed, we believe in
the
original
scriptures that were revealed to the prophets.
(iv) Belief that the Quran is a witness over them
and confirms them. The truth remains one and the same, and thus the Quran
confirms the truth which was in them. As for the laws, the Quran has abrogated
the previous scriptures.
First, a Muslim firmly believes that Divine Scriptures
were revealed by Allah to His messengers to guide mankind.  Muslims believe the
Quran is not the only spoken Word of Allah, but that Allah also spoke to
prophets before Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon
him.
“…and to Moses Allah spoke directly.” (Quran 4:164)
Allah describes true believers are those who:
“…believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad) and
what has been sent down before you.” (Quran 2:4)
The most important and central message of
all
scriptures was to worship Allah alone.
“And we sent never a messenger before you except that we
revealed to him, saying, ‘there is no God but I so worship Me.” (Quran 21:25)
Second, we believe in the scriptures mentioned in the Quran:
(i)   the Quran itself, revealed to Prophet
Muhammad.
(ii)  the Torah (
Taurah
in Arabic) revealed
to Prophet Moses (different from the Old Testament read today).
(iii) the Gospel (
Injeel
in Arabic) revealed
to Prophet Jesus (different from the New Testament read in churches today).
(iv) the Psalms (
Zabur
in Arabic) of David.
(v)  The scriptures (
Suhuf
in Arabic) of
Moses and Abraham.
We have a general belief that there were other
scriptures revealed by Allah whose names and specifics are not known to us.
Thus we cannot definitely affirm that scriptures of other religions prior to
Muhammad other than those mentioned were revealed from Allah.
Third, Muslims believe whatever is true in them and has
not been altered or corrupted in the previous scriptures.  This point will be
elaborated below so it becomes clear and no confusion remains.
Fourth, belief that Allah revealed the Quran as a
witness over the previous scriptures and to confirm them, as Allah says:
“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran)
in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and trustworthy in
highness and a witness over it (old Scriptures)” (Quran 5:48)
Meaning the Quran confirms whatever is true in previous
scriptures and rejects whatever alterations and changes human hands have made
in them, and that the laws brought by the Quran overrule and abrogate any laws brought
by the previous religions.
Original Scriptures & the Bible
We must distinguish between two matters: the
original
Torah, Gospel, and Pslams and the
present day
Bible.  We believe the
originals
were Allah’s revelation, but the
present day
Bible does
not
have
the exact original scripture.
No scripture exists today in the original language it
was revealed in, except the Quran.  The Bible was not revealed in English.  Different
books of today’s Bible are translations of translations and different versions
exist.  These multiple translations were done by people whose knowledge or
honesty is not known.  As a result, some Bibles are bigger than others and "

·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and
Articles of Faith (2 parts).
Objectives
·To learn what the Islamic belief in angels
entails.
·To familiarize oneself with the true reality
of angels as described in Islam.
·To learn about the number, names, abilities
and tasks of angels.
·To appreciate that belief in the angels does

Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief or
Imaan
in Islam.  It means to:
(i)   believe in the reality of angels
(ii)  the names assigned to the angels
(iii) the tasks and abilities of angels in heavens
and earth.
Reality of Angels
Angels are not ‘good forces of nature’, hologram images,
or illusions.  Neither are angels like a fat cherubic baby with a halo on its
head as often depicted in Christian illustrations.  They are real, created but are
generally hidden from our senses.  They have no divine qualities and are not
God’s associates running different districts of the universe.  Also, they are
not objects to be worshipped or prayed to as they do not intercede for us at
our request, nor do they deliver our prayers to God. 
They all submit to God and carry out His commands.  There are no fallen
angels; they are not divided into ‘good’ and ‘evil’ angels.  Human beings do
not become angels after death.
Angels were created from light before human beings.  The
angels are beautiful beings with wings as described in the Quran.
Angels form different hierarchies and orders in the
sense they are of different size, status, and merit.  The best were those
present at the battle of Badr who fought between the Prophet and the Meccan
pagans.
They are of great size.  The greatest of them is Gabriel. 
Our Prophet actually saw him in his original form.  He had six hundred wings and
blocked the horizon.  Jewels, pearls, and rubies fell from his wings, in a form
only Allah knows about .  Also, the attendants of God’s Throne are among the
greatest angels.  They love the believers and beseech Allah to forgive them
their sins.  They carry the Throne of Allah, about whom the Prophet said:
“I have been given permission to speak about one of
the angels of Allah that carry the Throne.  The distance between his ear-lobes
and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.” (
Abu Daud
)
They do not eat or drink.  When Abraham placed a calf in
front of the visiting angels who brought him the good news of a son, they
refused to eat:
“He said, ‘Will you not eat?’  (When they did not eat), he
conceived a fear of them.  They said: ‘Fear not,’ and they gave him glad
tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.” (Quran 51:26-28)
The angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and
worshipping Allah:
“They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.” (Quran 21:20)
The Number of Angels
How many angels there are?  Only Allah knows.
Al-Bayt
al-Ma’moor
is a sacred house in the heavens above the
Kabah
, the
black cubical sacred house in Mecca.  Every day seventy thousand angels visit
it and leave, never returning to it again, another group coming after them.
[1]
The Messenger of Allah said:
“Hell will be brought forth that day by means of
seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand
angels.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
The Names of Angels
We are required to believe in the names of the angels
that have been mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah.  They include:
Gabriel (
Jibreel
in Arabic), Michael (
Mikaa’eel
),
Israfeel
,
Malik
- the gatekeeper of Hell,
Munkar
and
Nakeer
,
and
Haarut
and
Maarut
and others.
The names Raphael and Azra’eel are not furnished in
Islamic texts.  Of the above, only Gabriel and Michael are mentioned in the
Bible.
Angelic Abilities
The angels have great powers given to them by Allah.
They have the ability to take on different forms other
than their own.  At the moment of Jesus’ conception, Allah sent Gabriel to Mary
in the form of a man, as Allah says in the Quran:
“…Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as
a man in all respects.” (Quran 19:17)
Angels also came to Abraham in human form, and he did
not know that they were angels until they told him so.  Similarly, angels came
to Lot to deliver him from danger in the form of young men with beautiful faces. 
Gabriel used to come to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, in different forms.  Sometimes he would appear in the form of one
of his handsome disciples, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin.
Angels have the ability to take human forms in some
circumstances involving common people, such as the ones who came to the man who
killed a hundred people and those who came to the blind, the bald and the leper.
The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of
light; the angels are able to travel much faster than thi"

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
Simply stated, there will be a Day when
God will resurrect and gather the first and the last of His creation and judge
everyone justly. People will enter their final abode, Hell or Paradise.
(A) Belief in Events of the Grave
Muslims believe that after a person
dies, the second, intermediate phase of life begins. Many events will take
place in this new “world.”
One of the first events is the “trial”
of the grave - everyone will be questioned by angels about their religion,
prophet, and Lord.
Second, a Muslim should also believe in
the punishment and the bliss of the grave. Basically a Muslim must believe in
the details of the events that will take place in the grave as they have come
in the Qur’an and
Sunnah
.
(B) Events of the Day of Judgment
After the duration of this earth is
over, Allah will command a great angel named
Israfeel
to blow the
Trumpet. At the first blowing, all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth
will fall unconscious, except those spared by God. The earth will be flattened
and the mountains turned into dust.
The skies will rain for forty days,
people will be resurrected into their original bodies from their graves,
thereby entering the third and final phase of life.
Israfeel
will blow the Trumpet for the second time upon which people will rise up from
their graves, alive. The disbelievers and the hypocrites will be caught by
surprise and regret, whereas the believers will find it exactly as they were
told.
The angels will drive all human beings
naked, uncircumcised, and bare-footed to the Great Plain of Gathering called
Hashr
.
The first one to be dressed on that Day will be Abraham. At the Great Plain of
Gathering, a re-created sun will shine close to their heads, and they will
sweat according to their deeds. Some people will be sheltered under the shade
of God’s Magnificent Throne.
When the conditions will become
unbearable, people will request God to allow the Prophets and the Messengers to
intercede on their behalf to save them from distress. All prophets will excuse themselves,
until Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, will
be allowed to intercede and thus Judgment will begin.
The Balances
The balances will be set and the deeds
of men will be weighed. These balances will be real. God will give the deeds of
His creatures a material existence with weight. Good deeds will be placed in
one pan and the evil deeds will be placed in the other, as Allah has informed
in the Qur’an.
The Records
Disclosure of the Records of the deeds
performed in this life will follow. The person who will receive his record in
his right hand will have an easy reckoning. He will happily go back to his
family. However, the person who will receive his record in his left hand would
wish he were dead as he will be thrown into the Fire. He will be full of
regrets as will wish that he were not handed his Record or that he had not
known it.
Then Allah will judge His creation.
They will be reminded and informed of their good and evil deeds. The faithful
will acknowledge their sins and be forgiven. The disbelievers will have no good
deeds to declare because an unbeliever is rewarded for his good deeds in this
life. Some scholars are of the opinion that the punishment of an unbeliever may
be reduced in lieu of his good deeds, except the punishment of the great sin of
disbelief.
The Prophet’s Pond
Every prophet will have a pond, but the
Pond of our Prophet will be the largest, sweetest, and with the largest number
of visitors. Its water will be sweeter than honey and whiter than milk; its
utensils will be as numerous as the stars; and anyone who quenches his thirst
once from it will never thirst again.
The
Siraat
The
Siraat
is a real bridge that
will be established over Hell extending between Paradise and the Fire. Anyone
who is steadfast on God’s religion in this life will find it easy to pass it.
It will be thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword! People will pass over
it as fast as the blinking of an eye, lightening, wind, fast moving horses,
running camels, or at a normal walking pace. Some will barely crawl over it.
They will be grabbed by iron hooks and thrust into the Fire. The one who
crosses the
Siraat
will get into Paradise.
Those who cross itwill be
assembled at a place between Paradise and Hell. They will get their mutual
debts settled and then allowed to enter Paradise.

Articles of Faith (2 parts).

down by Islam with regards to belief in divine decree (
Qadr
).
·To learn the first two components that the
belief in divine decree entails, i-e Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive and
complete and that Allah has recorded everything in the Preserved Tablet.
Arabic Terms
·
Qadr
– divine decree.
·
Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
- the Preserved
Tablet.
The sixth and last article of Islamic faith is
belief in divine decree (
Qadr
in Arabic).  The divine decree (
Qadr
)
is an extremely important article of faith, and people of various faiths have
differed among themselves concerning this issue for a long time.
The divine decree is Allah’s ‘hidden mystery’
whose depths are inaccessible for human beings to fathom.  A Muslim should
learn the correct belief regarding the divine decree and stick to the advice of
the Prophet:
“When the divine decree (
Qadr
) is
mentioned, take to silence.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
At the same time, we have been given enough
information about this subject in order for us to be at peace with it, even if
we may not know its intricacies. For this reason, it is a compulsory aspect of
faith, and emphasizing the importance of this belief, Ibn Umar, the famous
Companion of Prophet Muhammad, once swore and said of those who rejected it, ‘If
one of them were to spend gold equal to Mount Uhad in the way of Allah, it will
never be accepted by Allah from them, unless they believe in the divine decree
.
’
Ubada bin Samit, a Companion of the Prophet, was
on his death bed when his son visited him and asked,
‘O Father, give me advice so I may hold to it.’
Ubada said,
‘Sit down.  O my son, you shall never taste
faith, and shall not reach the reality of the knowledge of Allah until you have
faith in the divine decree, the good of it and the evil of it.’
So I said,
‘O my father, how do I know what is the good of the
divine decree and the evil of it?’
He said,
‘Know that what afflicted you, could never have missed
you; and what missed you, could never have afflicted you.  O my son, I heard
the Prophet of Allah say that the first thing Allah created was the Pen.  He
said to it, ‘Write’.  So it wrote everything that would take place till the Day
of Judgment.  O my son, if you die while not believing in this, then you will
enter the Fire.’
Ad-Daylami says:
“I went to Ubayy bin Ka’b and told him that I had
some doubts regarding the divine decree, so tell me something so that perchance
Allah makes it leave my heart.  He said, ‘If Allah were to punish the
inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, He would punish them and He would not
be unjust to them; and if He were to show Mercy to them, it would be better for
them than their deeds.  And if you were to spend gold the like of Mount Uhad,
it will not be accepted by Allah until you had faith in the divine decree.  And
know that what afflicted you could never have missed you, and what missed you
could never have afflicted you.’”
So he went to Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud who told him
the same thing.  So he went to Hudthaifah bin al-Yaman
[1]
who told him the same thing.  He went to Zayd bin Thabit who also told him the
same thing.
[2]
What is this faith in the divine decree (
Qadr
)
that these great Companions considered as salvation from the Fire?  What
exactly does one have to believe in?
(1)  Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive
and complete.
(2)  Allah has recorded everything in the
Preserved Tablet.
(3)  Allah’s Will always comes to pass, and
His Ability is perfect.
(4)  Allah created everything.
(1)    Allah’s Foreknowledge is All Inclusive and
Complete
The first necessary component is to believe in Allah’s
infallible foreknowledge.  Allah knows what the creatures will do, encompassing
everything by His knowledge.  He knows all that exists, in entirety and
totality, by virtue of His ancient and eternal foreknowledge.  It is the same
to Him whether it is related to His Actions or the acts of His slaves.  He
knows their state, obedience and disobedience, sustenance, life span, successes
and failures, and all their movements.  Before He created them, and even before
He created the heavens and the earth, Allah knew exactly who will enter Paradise and who will abide in Hell.
“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or
in the heavens.” (Quran 3:5)
“Do you not know that Allah knows all that occurs in
heaven and on earth?” (Quran 22:70)
Whoever refuses it denies Allah’s perfection,
because the opposite of knowledge is either ignorance or forgetfulness.  It
would mean Allah would have been mistaken in His foreknowledge of future
events; He would no longer be Omniscient.  Both are deficiencies which Allah is
free of.  When Pharaoh asked Moses:
“(Pharaoh said:) ‘What about the generations of old?’
(Moses) said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord,
in a Record.  My Lord is neither unaware nor He forgets’” (Quran 20:51, 52)

Unlike
the descriptions of the devil in Christian doctrine,
Shaytan
is not a
fallen angel; rather he is a
Jinn
who can think, reason and has free
will. Allah allowed him to reside amongst the Angels, but because of his pride
and arrogance that you can read about in the story of Prophet Adam on the
website
www.islamreligion.com
, he despairs
of ever knowing Allah’s mercy and has vowed not to inhabit the depths of Hell
alone. Satan’s wish is to take as many human beings with him to the Hellfire as
he can. Make no mistake about it; Satan is humankind’s mortal enemy. He is
cunning, crafty and supremely arrogant. Quran warns us of his enmity over and
over.
“O children of Adam.  Let not
Shaytan
deceive you...”
(Quran 7:27)
“Surely
Shaytan
is an enemy to you so take him as an
enemy...” (Quran 35:6)
“...And whoever takes
Shaytan
as a protector or helper
instead of Allah, has surely suffered a manifest loss.” (Quran 4:119)
It is important to understand that even Satan himself
recognises the Oneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped. Allah has
informed us that the promises of Satan are nothing but deceptions and lies, and
Satan concurs, for he can offer nothing.
“And
Shaytan
will say when the matter has
been decided: ""Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too
promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I
called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves...”
(Quran 14:22)
Every
act of disobedience that is hated by Allah is loved by
Shaytan
, he loves
immorality and sin.  He whispers into the ears of the believers, he
disrupts prayer and the remembrance of Allah. One of Islam’s greatest scholars,
Ibn ul Qayyim, may God have mercy on him, said: “One of his (Satan’s) plots is
that he always bewitches people’s minds until they are deceived, he makes
attractive to the mind that which will harm it”.
Satan
has
wide-ranging
experience in the field of deception; he has tricks and temptations and he
whispers relentlessly. Satan is able to pinch and poke, implanting thoughts and
desires. However Allah has not left humankind defenseless. He has provided us
with weapons and one of the greatest is information.
Satan is our
mortal enemy and in order to combat his tricks and illusions we need to know
him well. The long term goal of Satan is to deprive as many people as possible
of Paradise and to lead them to Hell.  To achieve this aim he has set many
short term goals. Being aware of these goals means we are able to arm ourselves
with weapons of defence.
Short Term Goals
1.To cause people to commit the great sin of
shirk
. Everyone
who worships something other than Allah, be it an idol, a statue, the sun, the
moon, a person or a principle, is in essence worshipping Satan.
[1]
2.To encourage people to commit sins and acts of disobedience. When
Satan despairs of ever being worshipped he is content with being obeyed in
matters that seem insignificant.
[2]
He loves immorality and sin because it has a direct effect on a person’s religious
commitment.
3.To prevent people from doing good deeds. Satan not only causes
people to commit sin and acts of disobedience, he is also content with
preventing them from doing acts of good.  Satan is patient; he lays in wait,
filling our minds with doubts, and superstitions. When a person is planning on
doing a good deed or action, he whispers to them to avoid it and plants small
nagging doubts in their mind.
4.To damage acts of worship. If Satan is not able to prevent
people from obeying Allah and performing righteous actions, he strives to
corrupt their acts of worship. When a person is praying he whispers and
distracts him. Satan’s desire is to prevent a person from taking their reward
for praying with
khushoo
and eventually to lead him or her away from
Allah altogether.
5.
To cause mental and physical harm.In addition to causing
believers to commit acts of
shirk
, Satan also aims to cause physical and
mental harm. For instance he sends bad dreams to cause a person distress and
fear. He disturbs people from the time they are born right up until the moment
of death. In their final moments, he continues his whispering and harassment to
prevent a person from calling on Allah and confirming their belief in God "

– The Oneness and Uniqueness
of Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and in His
right to be worshipped.
People who practice these
‘arts’ are often called  fortune-tellers, soothsayers, foreseers, augurs,
oracles, astrologers and palmists. They often claim the knowledge of the future
and use various methods and mediums from which they claim to extract their
information, like reading tea-leaves, drawing lines, writing numbers,
palm-reading, casting horoscopes, crystal ball gazing, rattling bones, and
throwing sticks.
Do they truly know what they claim?
1.    Some of them have no real knowledge.  They go
through a series of meaningless rituals and then make calculated general
guesses.  Some of their guesses may coincide with the truth.  People tend to remember
the few predictions that come true and forget about the many which do not.
2.    Another group has contact with the
Jinn
. 
It usually involves the grave sin of
shirk
, and those involved tend to
be more accurate in their information.
Role of
Jinn
The evil
Jinn
can often be summoned by performing
sacrilegious acts forbidden in the religion to aid their human partners in sin
and disbelief.  Once contact with the
Jinn
is made by fortune-tellers,
the
Jinn
may inform them of certain events in the future.  The Prophet,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, described how the
Jinn
gather information about the future.   He related that the
Jinn
were
able to travel to the lower reaches of the heavens and listen in on some of the
information about the future, which the angels pass among themselves.   They
would then return to the earth and feed the information to their human contacts. 
(
Bukhari
).  From this it is clear that the
Jinn
do
not
have knowledge of the unseen, rather they steal words that they hear from the
angels; in fact, the angels themselves do not have any knowledge of that until
Allah tells them of it.
The
Jinn
are also able to inform their human
contact of the future through another channel.  When someone comes to a
fortune-teller, the fortune-teller’s Jinn gets information from the man’s
Qareen
(the
jinn
assigned to every human being) of what plans he had made prior
to his coming.  So the fortune-teller is able to tell him that he will do this
or that, or go here or there.  By this method, the real fortune-teller is also
able to learn about a stranger’s past in vivid detail.  He is able to tell a
total stranger of his parents’ names, where he was born, and his childhood.
Visiting Fortune-tellers
The Prophet laid down principles which clearly forbade
any form of visitation of fortune-tellers.  He said:
“The prayer of whoever approaches a fortune-teller
and asks him about anything will not be accepted for 40 days and nights.” (Muslim)
The punishment is for simply approaching a
fortune-teller and asking him questions out of curiosity.
Belief in Fortune-tellers
Anyone who visits a fortune-teller
believing
that
he knows the unseen and the future has committed
kufr
(disbelief).  The
Prophet said:
“Whosoever approaches a fortune-teller and believes
what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.” (Abu
Dawud)
Such a belief assigns to creation some of Allah’s
attributes with regard to the knowledge of the unseen and the future.
The same applies to anyone who reads the books and
writings of fortune-tellers, listens to them on the Internet, radio, or the TV.
All the various methods used around the world by
oracles, fortune-tellers, and the likes, are forbidden to Muslims.
Palm-reading, I-Ching, fortune cookies, tea leaves as
well as Zodiacal signs and Bio-rhythm computer programs, all claim to inform
those who believe in them about their future.   However, Allah has stated in no
uncertain terms that He alone knows the future:
“Indeed, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone.  It is
He who sends down the rain and knows the contents of the wombs.   No one knows
what he will earn tomorrow nor in which land he will die, but Allah is
all-knowing and aware.”(Quran 31:34)

Astrology is the study of the relationship between the
movements of the stars and their influence on people and events.
Astrology has dramatically spread in recent years.  Books,

Belief in Divine Decree (part 2 of 2),https://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/40/belief-in-divine-decree-part-2,"If everything has been predestined by God, how

·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and
Articles of Faith (2 parts).
Objectives
·To learn the second two components that
belief in divine decree entails, i-e everything happens by the Will of Allah and
His Ability is perfect, and that Allah is the One who created everything.
·To clarify and dispel the confusion
regarding the question of freedom of will.
Arabic Terms
·
Qadr
– divine decree.
(3)    Allah’s Will Passes, and His Ability is Perfect
Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, and whatever
Allah does not will does not happen.  Nothing occurs in the heavens or on the earth
without the Will of Allah.  Hence, whatever is in the universe occurs by the
Will of Allah, be it a divine act or actions of the creation:
“Had He so willed, he would indeed have guided you
all.” (Quran 6:149)
If we were to say that something occurs in
existence without Allah willing it, that would mean that things can occur
without the Will of Allah, and that would be a shortcoming in Allah’s power and
will. Rather, everything that occurs can only be if Allah wills it. If He did
not will it to occur, it could have never come into being.
Likewise the actions of the creation occur by
the Will of Allah:
“And you do not will except that Allah wills – Lord of
the worlds.” (Quran 81:29)
No one can do anything except if Allah wills it
to be, had He willed that they do not take place, they would not have occurred.
(4)    Allah Created Everything
“He has created everything, and has measured it
exactly according to its own measurement.”
“For it is He who creates everything and determines
its nature in accordance with (His own) design.” (Quran 25:2)
This includes our characteristics and our deeds.
The human beings are created by Allah and so are
the actions and statements that result from them.  This is because the actions
and the statements of a person are his characteristics; if the person is a
creation, then so are his characteristics a creation of Allah.
“While Allah has created you and what you do.” (Quran 37:96)
We are given the physical ability and a choice. 
Our abilities like intelligence and memory differ just like our characteristics
like height, weight, and color.  Also, we are given a will and have a choice.
If one of them does not exist, the act would not
be performed.  The One who has created the choice and the ability is Allah, the
Creator of the cause and the effect.  Since Allah has created both, the ability
and the choice in us, hence the acts that we perform are also created by Allah.
Human Freedom of Will
Islamic belief in the divine decree (
Qadr
),
every human act both in material and spiritual life is predestined, keeps human
liberty intact without denying divine interference in human affairs.  It does
not undermine the principle of man’s moral freedom and responsibility.  Man is
not a helpless creature borne along by destiny.  It is incorrect to believe the
action of fate is blind, arbitrary, and relentless.
All is known, but freedom is also granted.
Man is responsible for his acts.  Lethargic
nations and individuals indolent to ordinary affairs of life are to blame
themselves, not Allah.  Man is bound to obey the moral law; and he will receive
merited punishment or reward as he violates or observes that law.  However, if such
is so, man must have it in his power to break or keep the law.  Allah would not
hold us responsible for something unless we were capable of doing it:
“Allah does not burden any human being with more than
he is well able to bear.” (Quran 2:286)
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as
you can.” (Quran 64:16)
Everyone knows the difference between being
compelled to do something and being free; having the choice of doing it, between
a gun put to one’s head and being free in making decisions.
Some people mistakenly imagine the divine decree
of each individual’s future life is so rigorously predetermined in all its
details by Allah that his own volitions or desires have no power to alter the
course of events.  It defeats common sense to reject faith or commit a sin even
before knowing whether or not it was destined! Everyone has the ability to
choose between righteousness and evil, so how can a person willfully choose the
road to perdition and use the divine decree (
Qadr
) as an excuse?  It is
more appropriate to walk on the blessed path and attribute it to one’s destiny. 
Allah knows from eternity with infallible certainty who will be saved and
doomed, while Allah has this infallible foreknowledge, we, on our part, cannot
have an absolutely certain assurance as to how we will end.  The Prophet, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, spoke the truth when he said:
“Seek what is beneficial to you, and ask
Allah for help.  Do not lose hope, and if something were to afflict you, do not
say ‘If I had done so and so’, because saying ‘If’ opens the doors for the
devil.”
“If he is from the successful ones, then
the deeds of the successful ones are made easy for him.” (

featherless arrows to predict situations.  It was prevalent in pre Islamic
Arabia (includes such things as drawing lots, and trying to predict the future).
The means used by Shaytan to misguide people
Making lies and deceptions
appear attractive
.
Shaytan
makes falsehood appear in the guise of
truth and truth appear in the guise of falsehood.  He does this by planting
doubts in people’s mind in exactly the same way as he tempted our Father and
Mother Adam and Eve.  Whispers, doubts and delusions are all part of his bag of
tricks.  Nowadays we see unlawful activities being practiced by many; they are
made to appear attractive and are given names that draw a person towards it.
God has given us a great line of defense; once we equip ourselves with the
knowledge of the laws of Islam, this will unveil the plots of Satan and make it
clear to us his intent.
Tempting people to extremism or
negligence.
If Satan finds a person is serious and cautious, always trying
to do the right thing, he tempts him to strive to excess.  He whispers, do not
sleep when others sleep, do not break your fast when others do and so on.  If
Shaytan sees that a person is lazy or prone to look for the easy way he will
tempt him to be indifferent or negligent.  He encourages procrastination and
laziness.  To protect oneself from this, one should stay close to the Sunnah of
Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him.
Making false promises.
Quran
stresses this evil ploy several times with great emphasis.
“
Shaytan
makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and
Shaytan's
promises are nothing but deceptions.”(Quran 4:120)
Satan fills people’s
heads with vain desires and wishes and keeps them busy working on false dreams
and rewards.  This distracts them from the more important things and working
for the Hereafter.  He calls humankind to sin and transgression yet he claims
to be giving sincere advice.
Gradually misleading people.
Satan makes minor sins appear to be nothing until they are piled high upon
one another.  Whenever Satan tricks a person into committing a sin, he leads
him straight on to another sin, and then another and each time the sins become
greater until finally he causes a person to commit the greatest sin of all,
disbelieving in Allah, or ascribing partners to Him.
Causing people to forget what is
in their best interest.  Human beings are forgetful.  It is a trait that is in all
of us and Our creator knows this very well.
“And indeed We made a covenant
with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found on his part no firm will-power.”
(Quran 20:115)
Satan takes this a step further by whispering until a
person forgets exactly what is good for him and what things will lead to sin.  One
example where this could happen is where the religion of Allah is being mocked
in a light-hearted way. Allah cautions us not to take part in such
conversations. He says:
“And when you see those who engage in a false conversation
about Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till
they turn to another topic.  And if Satan causes you to forget, then after the
remembrance sit not you in the company of the wrongdoing people.” (Quran 6:68)
Making people afraid of his
allies.
Another way Satan misguides people is to make them afraid of his (Satan’s)
troops and allies.  He has surrounded himself with evil minions, jinn and human
beings.  He instills the thoughts that they are powerful and fearsome, and if
not obeyed they can harm us.
“It is only
Shaytan
that suggests to you the fear of
his supporters and friends; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true)
believers.” (Quran3:175)
Satan
misguides a
person through what he loves and desires.
Satan finds out what we love or
desire and uses it against us.  He also passes this information on to his
helpers and they attack us with the very things we are attached to.  How often
are our prayers disturbed by thoughts of our children or spouse? Are we guilty
of shopping and delaying our prayer? Satan senses what we like and then sets
about to twist our thoughts.
By instilling doubts.
Shaytan
does not want anyone to turn to Allah in repentance, regretting (past mistakes)
and turning towards what is right and good.  Instead he wants to divert people
away from Allah by using many kinds of temptations and baseless arguments.  He instills
doubts to make a person feel anxious and uncertain.
Through alcohol, gambling,
idolatry, witchcraft and fortunetelling.
Although Allah warns us against
these practices, human beings are weak and Satan takes advantage of this by
making these practices look attractive or worthwhile.  He encourages people to
engage in these pra"

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
The significance of dreams
A dream
is a series of thoughts, images and sensations that occur in the mind whilst a
person is asleep.  Dreams are a universal human experience and the dreamer has
very little control over the content.  Our experiences in dreams have very lifelike
qualities and can be extremely vivid and often bizarre.  Some people report
very emotional experiences during dreams and frightening or upsetting dreams
are often referred to as nightmares.  Throughout the history of humankind
people have tried to interpret their dreams and many people believe they
contain important messages or symbols.  There are many superstitions and
beliefs associated with dreams and Islam has cleared up many misconceptions
involving dreams and their interpretation.
The scholars of Islam say that while dreams can be
meaningful, not all dreams should be considered important.  Ibn Siren is
considered the Islamic world’s foremost expert on dream interpretation and he
calls it a difficult science that should be treated with the utmost care.  The importance
of a dream is usually determined by the impression it makes on the dreamer,
however most dreams have no real value and thus no need for interpretation.
The three types of dreams
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, told us that there are three types of dreams
[1]
. 
A true dream (sometimes called a good dream) that comes to us from Allah, a bad
or frightening dream that comes from the
Shaytan
and the third is a
dream that comes from a person’s experiences and thoughts.  Each one should be
managed differently.
Prophet Muhammad said that if anyone has a dream that he
likes then it is from Allah.  He should therefore thank Allah for it and
narrate it to others
[2]
.   The Prophet went
further and said that if a person has a good dream, he should expect good
things to happen and only narrate the dream to people that he likes
[3]
. 
An example of this in the Quran is when Prophet Yusuf narrated to his father the
dream he had about the sun, the moon and the stars prostrating themselves to
him.  His father, Prophet Yaqub told Yusuf not to relate the dream to his
brothers.
“Remember when Yusuf said to his father: ‘O my father! Verily,
I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon - I saw them
prostrating themselves to me.’ He (the father) said, ‘O my son! Relate not your
vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.’…” (Quran
12: 4 & 5)
Frightening or disturbing dreams are from
Shaytan
and are nothing more than his attempts to scare and terrify us.  Prophet
Muhammad tells us that theses dreams will not harm a person in anyway.  Thus if
a person has a bad dream or nightmare he should spit dryly (no saliva should be
ejected) to his left three times and seek refuge from
Shaytan
with Allah
[4]
. 
He also recommended turning over
[5]
.
The third type of dream is one that does not fit into
either the good or bad category.   These dreams come from what a person has
been thinking or worrying about or from the experiences, events and fears
stored in the memory and the subconscious.   These dreams are of no consequence
and there is no interpretation for them.
Rules of dream interpretation
It is the opinion of most Islamic scholars that dreams
should be interpreted only by someone that is qualified to do so.  The reason
for this is that the interpretation of dreams can be problematic.  Take for
instance a simple thing such as knowing whether the dream you had was about you
or someone else or even someone connected to someone else.  A companion of
Prophet Muhammad’s saw in a dream the great enemy of Islam Abu Jahl becoming
Muslim and pledging allegiance to the Prophet.  This did not happen; it was Abu
Jahl’s son who sometime later converted to Islam and vowed allegiance.  Symbol’s
in dreams are also problematic because they mean different things to different
people.
We must be careful not to rely too much on dreams or
believe that they are filled with hidden meanings and symbols.  However there
are some dreams that are easy to interpret.  If Prophet Muhammad appears in a
dream and looks as he is described in the
Sunnah
then we can be sure that
this is a true dream, one from Allah and full of good tidings.  The Prophet
said that whoever sees him in a dream has indeed seen the truth
[6]
.
In regards to interpreting dreams as an answer to an
Istikarah
prayer
[7]
,
then this is an incorrect practice.  Allah does not answer this prayer through dreams. "

- A creation of Allah that was

as spirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.
·
Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
The “jinn” are a separate creation of Allah like the
human beings and angels.  They can think like human beings and choose the path
of good or evil, but, unlike human beings, the
jinn
are created from fire
(Quran 15:27, 55:15).  Also, the
jinn
are generally invisible to human
beings (Quran 7: 27) and have some special abilities that human beings simply
do not have.
Believing in
jinn
is not optional.  Since they
are mentioned in the Quran and in the Prophet’s
Sunnah
, a Muslim is
required to believe in their existence and whatever information we find about
them in the two Islamic sources.
Life of the
Jinn
The
jinn
live on earth like human beings do, but
they are found more often in ruins and impure places like toilets and cemeteries. 
They love to sit between the shade and sunlight.
All
jinn
are not equal.  Among them are good
jinn
and among them are evil ones.  Allah mentions in the Quran what the
jinn
said about themselves:
“There are among us some that are righteous, and some the
contrary.  We follow divergent paths.” (Quran 72:11)
There are Muslim and non-Muslim
jinn
.
“And among us are Muslims and among us are disbelievers (who
have deviated from the Right Path).  And whosoever has embraced Islam, then
such have sought the Right Path.” (Quran 72:14)
The
jinn
eat and drink, sometimes with us.  It is
easy to keep them away from eating and drinking with us as we will learn later. 
 They also marry and have children.  Allah has mentioned the children of the
jinn
in the Quran, “...Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors rather
than Me?...” (Quran 18:50)
Jinn
do not live forever, they do die.  The
Prophet used to say in one of his prayers,
“I seek refuge with Your Glory,
there is no true God other than You, the One Who never dies, and the humans and
the
jinn
die.”
(
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
The
jinn
can take the shape of snakes, black
cats, black dogs, and sometime they can assume human form.
The
jinn
also have riding animals as mentioned in
the Quran:
“And incite [to senselessness] whoever you can among them with
your voice and assault them with your horses…” (Quran 17:64)
Abilities of the
Jinn
Compared to human beings, the
jinn
have some
special abilities. One, they can travel very fast.  Allah tells us in the
Quran:
""
lfreet
of the
jinn
said, “I will bring it
to you before you can rise from your place.  Surely, I am strong and trustworthy
for such work.” (Quran 27:39)
They can reach the skies as they are quoted to say in
the Quran:
“And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled
with stern guards and flaming fires.“ (Quran 72:8)
They can take different shapes as mentioned earlier.  The
evil
jinn
– the devils – can possess the human body.  They can also
whisper thoughts and influence human beings:
“From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in
the hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one’s heart after one
remembers Allah).” (Quran 114:4)
Jinn
’s Weaknesses
Even though the evil
jinn
– the devils – have
special abilities, a believer is protected by Allah.  The devils cannot harm a
righteous Muslim by Allah’s permission.
“Surely, My (faithful) slaves - over them you have no power; and
your Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)
The following are some examples of their limited powers:
1.    They fear some believers.
“Surely, My (faithful) slaves – over them you have no power,
and your Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)
“The believer emaciates his devil in the same way
that one of you weakens his camel during travel.” (
Musnad
)
2.    The Prophet said that if we cover our plates
and say ‘
Bismillah
,’ the devils cannot take off the cover.  Similarly,
they cannot enter a house if we close the door saying ‘
Bismillah
.’
“If the man enters his house and mentions the name
of Allah upon entering it and upon eating therein, Satan says, ‘There is no
lodging for you here and no meal here.’ But if the man enters his house and
neglects to mention the name of Allah upon entering it, Satan says, ‘I have
found lodging for you.’ And if he does not mention Allah’s name upon eating his
meal, Satan says, ‘I have found lodging and a meal.’ (
Saheeh Muslim, Musnad
)
3.    They can take different forms, but they can
not take the form of Prophet Muhammad.  The Prophet said,
“Whoever sees me in a dream will have indeed seen
me, for Satan cannot mimic my appearance.” Abu ‘Abdullah said, “Ibn Sirin said,
‘Only if he sees the Prophet in his (real) shape.’” (

Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
We learned in the previous lesson that some
jinn
are good and some are evil. Allah has given them the ability to become
believers or disbelievers. The evil
jinn
are known as devils or
shayateen
in Arabic. The leader of the devils is known as Satan or
Iblees
in
Arabic. He has a very ugly appearance and has two horns.
The Story of
Iblees
Satan used to worship Allah with the angels before he
became arrogant. He chose the evil path in life, knowing it would bring him
punishment. Allah created Adam and ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam.
Satan used to worship Allah with the angels, so he was also addressed to
prostrate himself as well but he refused Allah’s order out of arrogance. As a result,
Satan was cast out of Paradise. He made a promise to Allah that he will mislead
the children of Adam if Allah allowed him to live till the Day of Judgment.
Thus, he became the greatest enemy of man. He saw that Adam was the cause for his
expulsion from Heaven and the reason why Allah cast His curse upon him.
Mission of Satan and the Devils
Satan, or
Iblees
, is the Commander in Chief of
the battle against the earthly human beings. He lays the strategy of this
battle against human beings, dispatches his soldiers, and then reviews their
performance. He praises those who accomplish his mission. The Prophet of Allah
has told us,
“
Iblees
sets his throne on the water. From there,
he sends out his troops to tempt mankind. The one whom he regards as closest to
him is the one who causes the greatest temptation. One of them returns to him
and says, ‘I stayed with so and so and did not leave him until he did such and
such,’ and he is told, ‘You have done nothing.’ Then one comes and reports, ‘I
did not leave him until he separated from his wife.’
Iblees
then brings
him near to him and says, ‘How fine are you!’
[1]
He has soldiers among the
jinn
, known as devils,
and among human beings. Among his soldiers from the
jinn
is the
qareen
,
the devil that accompanies every human being.
The ultimate goal of Satan is to take human beings with
him to Hellfire and keep them from entering Paradise. He does this by getting
people to worship others besides Allah. If he cannot do that, then he leads
them to sin and to disobey Allah. He tries to block people from doing good
deeds. If he cannot do that, then he will do his best to ruin the acts of
worship so the person will not receive any reward for them.
One of the means by which Satan misleads people is
sorcery. Sorcerers can sometimes perform acts to please the devils who in turn
do their bidding. Sorcery is sometimes used to create a separation between
husband and wife (Quran 2:102). Sorcery is of two types, some of it is an
illusion and some is real. Real sorcery can cause separation between spouses
and cause other harms.
Protection Against Satan and the Devils
1.    The greatest means of protecting oneself
against the devil is by sticking to the Quran and
Sunnah
and by living
according to Islam’s teachings. Allah has said in the Quran,
“O you who believe, enter into Islam completely and do not
follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an open enemy to you.” (Quran
2:208)
2.    Seeking protection with Allah.  Actually
turning to Allah and asking Him for protection is one of the best ways to be
safe from Satan.  Allah teaches us in the Quran the words of protection that
can be translated as,
And say, ‘My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the whisperings
of the devils and I seek refuge with You, My Lord, in case they come close to
me.’” (Quran 23:97-98)
3.    Place your children and property under
Allah’s care.  Allah’s Messenger used to seek protection for his grand children
with these words:
“U’eedhu-kuma bi kalimaa-til-laahit-taamah min
kulli shaytaanin wa haama wa min kulli aynin laamah.”
“I commend you two to the protection of the perfect
words of Allah, from every devil and vermin, and from every evil eye.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
)
4.    The best words to seek Allah’s protection.
The last two chapters of the Quran,
Surah
al-Falaq and
Surah
an-Naas, are the best words to seek protection (
Sunan
Nasai
).

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
What drives us?  What makes us do the things we
do?  What makes us happy?
Many people will answer maximizing pleasure and
minimizing pain is the ultimate key to human happiness.
If so, how come people can be happy while in
pain and unhappy while experiencing pleasure?  If pleasure is not the only
motivating force that drives us, what does?  What desires must we fulfill to
live a happy life?
For most of those who see happiness in the carnal,
rather than the spiritual, it is pretty basic: desire to avoid pain and
anxiety, desire to spend time with relatives, desire to eat, desire for sexual
gratification, desire for companionship, and desire for recognition to name a
few.
Life for such can be toilsome, provoking the
plain query; what is it really aiming for?  In their quest for happiness, all
too often people fall short of achieving any kind of inner peace.  We think
that by always reaching higher and accomplishing more - more money, a better
body, the perfect mate - we will automatically be happy.  That is an illusion. 
People get caught up in chasing the materialistic dream under the illusion
money can buy happiness until they discover the limits of materialism.  Impressing
the neighbors and envy of possessions leaves us devoid of passion and depth in
our lives, leading to the Modern Man’s Paradox:  Spiritual hunger in an age of
plenty.
What is the paradox?  Simply put, it is this: As
members of certain materialistic societies have grown richer, they have grown
less content with their lives.  No society in the history of the world has ever
enjoyed the standard of living known today in these societies: Incomes are up,
prices are stable, unemployment is down, life expectancy is rising; they enjoy
more freedom and opportunity than ever before.  Even their poor live well by
world standards.  Yet in America, for example, since 1960, the divorce rate has
doubled, teen suicide has tripled, violent crime has quadrupled, the prison
population has quintupled, and some estimates put the incidence of depression
in the year 2000 at ten times what it was in the year 1900.  Americans are less
happy today than they were 40 years ago, despite the fact that they make 2.5
times as much money.  Our bellies may be filled, but we are left spiritually
hungry.
To find out what really drives human behavior,
two kinds of happiness must be distinguished: feel-good happiness and
value-based happiness.  Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure.  When
we joke around or eat our favorite food, we experience feel-good happiness.  This
type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time.
Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives
have meaning and fulfill the larger purpose of our existence by connecting us
to Allah.  It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our
deeper purpose and values.  Living a God-conscious life rooted in the values of
the Quran and
Sunnah
, a Muslim is driven - beyond sensual pleasures - by
the desire to make it to Paradise and to be safe from Hell after death.
Islamic values that take a person towards Paradise and away from Hell are the most significant factors in motivating a Muslim’s
behavior and in contributing to his or her sense of happiness. The desire to achieve
 Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all
other desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on
wealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of
making it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of
devotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on
pleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One
must remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.
To be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams
and realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!
Ultimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate
goal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. 
Paradise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of
God, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence
of pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is
an abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel
the least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally
realized.

·To learn about some of the joys that Paradise
holds.
·To appreciate that the greatest joy will be
seeing Allah in Paradise.
The Joys of Paradise
Those who enter Paradise will do so in their
most perfect, beautiful form.  Their hearts will be one.  They will neither
spit, nor blow their noses, or defecate.  They will remain young forever,
strong and potent without the inconveniences of body hair.
The worldly pleasures pretty much fade in the
face of heavenly delights
.
The pleasures of this world are
fleeting and short-lived, for ‘…short is the enjoyment of this world,’ whereas
the joys of Paradise will be unending, as ‘…the provision is eternal.’
The fine clothes, delicious foods, soothing
drinks, ornate jewels, and grand palaces in Paradise are far superior to what
is in this world.  The ‘real estate’ of Paradise is described by the Prophet to
be better than the whole world!
Paradise is free of any pollutants, foul odors,
pain, or discomfort.  The hearts and speech will be pure.  No one will be
offended or insulted.
The delicious, ripe fruits of Paradise will be
within easy reach, ready for its residents to pick whatever fruit one desires. 
Any food or drink will be available on demand.  Paradise has seas of water,
wine, milk, and honey from which rivers will flow out.  You simply take your
pick!  It has fountains scented with camphor and ginger, and shady valleys.  The
wine will not cause hangovers.  It is “delight for those who drink”, bringing
neither drunkenness
[1]
nor rousing
folly or quarrelling.
The inhabitants of Paradise will be served in
gold and silver goblets and dishes.  Their finest silk clothes will be
decorated with gold, silver, and pearls…better than any man-made garment!  The
scent of Musk will emanate from their bodies..  Their palaces will distinguished
by refined elegance and be fully furnished.  They will be able to sit and
recline in their gardens.  The beautiful bright colored couches will be lined
with silk brocade.  Eye catching cushions and splendid carpets will add style
and luxury.  A cozy place most people can simply dream of in this world, and  tranquil
spot away from distractions;  peaceful, comfortable, and richly decorated.
The faithful, who ‘will be served by immortal youths,
with cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine;’ exquisite banquets
served in priceless vessels.
The faithful will visit one another and reunite
with family and friends who made it to Paradise.  All wishes will be fulfilled,
some in the strangest ways.  The Messenger of Allah said:
“If the believer in Paradise wishes for a
child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in
an instant.” (
Al-Tirmidhi
)
Naturally, running after worldly pleasures at
the cost of heavenly delights will be a cause of much sorrow for people who
will enter Hell.
Spouses & Intimacy in Paradise
Just as some people can’t perceive colors, so we
may be soul-blind and soul-deaf.  The soul’s yearnings simply don’t get through
to consciousness; or if they do, we try to numb ourselves to them with
medications or frenzied activities.  The resulting alienation within our very
hearts bears its own loneliness.  The soul wants to be attached and involved,
because it is through such intimacy that it is nourished, initiated, and
deepened.  The faithful will enjoy earthly and heavenly spouses in Paradise
to satisfy the soul’s cravings for companionship and intimacy.  All the
urgencies of the soul – the feeling of longing, the ache of desire for a
beautiful, compatible partner, and the urgency to visit old friends – will be
met.  The select will rejoice in the company of the parents, spouses and
children who were believers.
The faithful will be clothed in the richest
silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns
set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, and pillows. In order
to enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,
and vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise
“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most
able to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and
strength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose
their youth.”
The faithful will enter Paradise in the best and
most perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their
eternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.
The faithful will enjoy specially crafted
maidens, or
houris
, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of
mortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,
and inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public
view in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of
gratification.
Vision of Allah
In heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly
and distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through "

Belief in the Day of Judgment
(also known as the Day of Resurrection and the Last Day and in Arabic
Yom al-Qiyyamah
)
is one of the six pillars of the Islamic faith.  This means that it is a
concept that a Muslim is required to believe and understand.  Basically Muslims
believe that there will come a day when the universe as we know it will be
destroyed and the dead will be resurrected to face Allah, the Almighty to be
judged according to their deeds in this life.  The ultimate goal is to be
accepted into a never ending paradise.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, they are
dwellers of Paradise, they dwell therein forever.   (Quran 2:82)
Many people wait and look forward to this momentous Day with
a mixture of fear and anticipation.  Others believe it is something  far off that
does not concern them and still others look for the signs of the coming of this
Day.
Surah
21 of the Quran acknowledges the thoughtlessness of many
when it begins,
“Draws near for humankind their reckoning, while they turn
away in heedlessness.” (Quran 21:1)
Countless books and articles have been written and
videos made of the signs of the Day of Judgment without knowing exactly what to
believe and what not to believe.  The aim of this and the following lesson is
to set out the signs of the Day of Judgment in an informal and easily
understood way.  Two important points to bear in mind whenever reading or
researching about the Day of Judgment are as follows.  Firstly, the knowledge
of the signs, trials and tribulations associated with the Day of Judgement must
be derived from the Quran and the authentic
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad. 
And secondly, nobody knows when the hour
[1]
will occur.
“Verily Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour…”
(Quran 31:34)
Humankind is only able to look for the signs.
The Prophet said, “The Hour will come when leaders are
oppressors, when people believe in the stars and reject
al-Qadr
(divine decree)
[2]
, when a trust
becomes a way of making a profit, when people give
Sadaqah
reluctantly, when adultery becomes widespread - when this happens, then your
people will perish.“
Minor signs
Minor signs of the Day of Judgment are those signs that
may occur a long time before the actual Day.  They happen in the course of
daily world events, they are numerous and often go pass unnoticed, even
occurring repeatedly.   Some commentators have estimated that there are more
than 100 minor signs of the Day of Judgment.  Contemplating the minor signs of
the Day of Judgement should serve to remind believers that Allah has
foreknowledge of everything that is occurring or will occur in the future.  Allah’s
knowledge is vast and superior and He is aware of all that we do, see or think. 
We will list some of the more well-known minor signs and ask you to consider
whether or not these signs are happening around you or have happened in the
past.
·Time will pass rapidly, good deeds will
decrease, miserliness will be thrown (in the hearts of the people), afflictions
will appear and there will be much ‘Al-Harj.” They said, “O Allah’s Apostle!
What is “Al-Harj?” He said, “Killing! Killing!”
·The common appearance of lewd acts, working
to bring about lewd acts, the cutting off of the ties of relationship and the
trusting of deceivers.
·The disappearance of knowledge and the
appearance of ignorance.
·Wealth will be in abundance; so abundant
that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his
Zakah
,
and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be
offered) will say, ‘I am not in need of it.’
·The people compete with one another in
constructing high buildings.
·A man when passing by a grave of someone
will say, ‘Would that I was in his place’.
·Two parties of Muslims will confront each
other and there is a large-scale massacre amongst them and the claim of both of
them is the same.
·People will establish ties with strangers
and sever relations with their near and dear ones.
·Earthquakes will increase.
·Any gain is shared out only among the rich,
with no benefit to the poor.
·A trust becomes a means of making a profit.
·Paying
Zakah
becomes a burden.
·Men obey their wives and disobey their
mothers; and treat their friends kindly whilst shunning their father"

Iqamah
– This word refers to the
second call to prayer that is given immediately before the prayer begins.
The major signs of the Day of
Judgment are those events that will occur shortly before the Day begins.  They
are extraordinary and supernatural events and do not occur repeatedly.  These
events are the precursor to the actual blowing of the trumpet when life as we
know it will cease to exist.
The appearance of the Mahdi
A man from the descendants of the Prophet Mohammad will
appear and the religion of Allah will prevail.  The Mahdi will take control of
the land (or the earth) and it will be filled with justice, wrongdoing and
oppression will no longer exist.  It is said in an authentic
hadith
that
the Mahdi’s name will be like the name of Prophet Muhammad and his father’s
name will be like the Prophet’s father’s name.  He will be a descendant of
Fatimah, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad and he will appear in the East.
The Dajjaal (The Antichrist)
This is a man from the sons of Adam.  His features are
mentioned in authentic
ahadith
; he will have a ruddy complexion and
curly hair, and will be one-eyed, with his right eye looking like a floating
grape.  Between his eyes will be written the letters “kaaf-fa-ra“ (in unjoined
letters) or “
kaafir
” (disbeliever), which every Muslim, literate or
illiterate, will be able to read.  He will also be the last of his line,
sterile with no children.
The
fitnah
(trial, tribulation) of the Dajjaal
will be the greatest
fitnah
ever because of the power Allah will permit
him to have.   He will work great miracles both amazing and confusing.  He will
have a paradise and a hell, but his paradise will in fact be a hell, and vice
versa.  He will have rivers of water and mountains of bread.  He will command
the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth
its produce, and it will bring forth its produce.
The destruction of the Dajjaal will come at the hands of
Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus), “The Dajjaal will emerge among my nation… and Allah
will send Isa ibn Maryam… and he will pursue him and destroy him.”
[1]
The descent of Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary)
After the Dajjaal has appeared and caused
fitnah
throughout
the land, Allah will send Isa ibn Maryam, who will descend to the earth at a
white minaret in the East of Damascus, Syria, resting his hands on the wings of
two angels.  He will descend at the time when the
iqamah
for prayer is
being given, and he will pray behind the leader of that group.  Quran commentator
Ibn Kathir sums up several
ahadith
about the descent of Isa ibn Maryam
when he says “Isa ibn Maryam will descend before the Day of Judgement as a just
leader and fair ruler”.
Yajooj and Majooj (Gog and Magog)
Yajooj and Majooj are human beings, descended from Adam
and Hawa (Eve).  According to the descriptions in the
sunnah
they appear
to belong to the Turkic-Mongol race, with small eyes, small, flat noses and
wide faces.  Their appearance at the end of time is one of the signs of the
Hour, “Until, when Yajooj and Majooj are let loose (from their barrier), and
they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise (Day of Resurrection)
shall draw near (to fulfilment)…”
(Quran 21: 96 & 97)
The swallowing up of the earth
This means that a place is swallowed up in the earth and
disappears into it, as is described in the Quran, “So We caused the earth to
swallow him and his dwelling place…”
(Quran 28:81)
Three of these
events will occur.
It is said that three huge landslides or earthquakes
(tsunami) will happen, one in the East, one in the West and one in the Arabian
Peninsula.
The smoke
Another of the major signs of the Hour will be the
appearance of “the smoke”.  “Then watch for the Day when the sky will bring a
visible smoke. Covering the people; this is a painful torment.”
(Quran 44:10
& 11)
The smoke will affect both the believers and the disbelievers. 
The believers will be affected as if suffering from a cold while the disbelievers
will be rendered unconscious.
The rising of the sun from the West
“The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from
the West, and when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, but
that will be w"

Meaning
In the simplest of words, “intercession” means to act as
a mediator on behalf of someone to get them some benefit or ward off harm from
them.
Intercession on the Day of Resurrection is of two types:
1.Accepted Intercession: This is intercession which is proven in
the texts of
Shariah
. More details will be given below.
2.Rejected Intercession: This is intercession which according to
the texts of the Quran and
Sunnah
is invalid and ineffective as will be explained
in Part 2.
There are two types of Accepted Intercession that will
take place in the Hereafter:
A. Intercession Exclusive to the Prophet
The first type is an exclusive intercession that which
will be granted only to Prophet Muhammad and no one else will share it with
him. It is of various kinds:
1.The Greatest Intercession also known as
maqam-mahmood
or
the ‘station of praise and glory.’ The earlier and later generations will ask
the Prophet to intercede for them with their Lord so that He might relieve them
of the horrors of the Day of Judgement. This is the ‘station of praise and
glory’ which Allah has promised to him in the Quran:
“And in some parts of the night (also) offer the prayer with
it (i.e. recite the Quran in the prayer) as an additional prayer for you (O
Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to
maqam-mahmood
.” (Quran
17:79)
The Prophet Muhammad will intercede for all of mankind
so that the reckoning can begin. In a narration it states that mankind will be
distressed and anxious and will reach a point where they can no longer bear the
lengthy wait and will say, “Who will intercede for us with our Lord so that He
will pass judgement among His slaves?”  So people will come to the prophets,
each of whom will say, “I am not suitable for this position,” until they come
to our Prophet, who will say, “I am able to do it.” So he will intercede for
them that judgement may be passed.
This intercession belongs exclusively to the Prophet
Muhammad.
There are many other reports that speak of this
intercession: “The people will fall on their knees on the Day of Resurrection,
each nation following its prophet, saying, ‘O So and so, intercede!’ until
intercession is granted to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him). On that Day Allah will resurrect him to a station of praise and
glory.”
[1]
2.Intercession of the Prophet Muhammad that the believers be
granted permission to enter Paradise.
The Messenger of Allah said: “I will come to the gate of
Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The
gatekeeper will say, ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say, ‘I was
commanded not to open it for anyone before you.’”
[2]
According to another report narrated by Muslim, “I will
be the first one to intercede concerning Paradise.”
3.Intercession of Prophet Muhammad for his paternal uncle Abu
Talib, so that the torment of the Fire be reduced for him. This applies only in
the case of the Prophet and his paternal uncle Abu Talib.
Once, Abu Talib was mentioned in the presence of the
Messenger of Allah. He said, “Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the
Day of Resurrection, and he will be placed in a shallow part of the Fire which
will come up to his ankles and cause his brain to boil.”
[3]
4.Intercession that some people of his
Ummah
may enter
Paradise without being brought to account.
This kind of intercession was mentioned by some of the
scholars, who quoted as evidence the lengthy hadith which states:
“Then it will be said, ‘O Muhammad, raise you head; ask,
it will be given to you; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ So I
will raise my head and say, ‘My
Ummah
, O Lord; my
Ummah
, O Lord;
my
Ummah
, O Lord.’ It will be said, ‘Admit those among your
Ummah
who are  not to be brought to account through the right-hand gate of Paradise.
They will share the other gates with the people of other nations.’”

Conditions of Intercession
One of the most important matters to understand is that
Allah and Allah alone ‘owns’ intercession.  No human being ‘owns’ intercession.
Intercession in the Hereafter will only happen if the
following conditions are met:
1. Allah must approve of the person for
whom
intercession is made.
“…and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is
pleased” (Quran 21:28)
One for whom intercession is made must be a believer in
Tawheed
because Allah is not pleased with the
mushrikoon
(polytheists).
.
It was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who will be the most
blessed of people by your intercession of the Day of Resurrection?’ The
Messenger of Allah said:
“O Abu Hurayrah, I thought that no one would ask me
about this
hadith
before you because I have seen how keen you are to
learn
hadith
.  The people who will be most blessed by my intercession on
the Day of Resurrection are those who say
La ilaha illa Allah
sincerely
from the heart.’”
2.  Allah must give permission to intercede.
“Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His
Permission?” (Quran 2:255)
3.  Allah must approve of the
intercessor
.
“…whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has
given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with” (Quran 53:26)
Rejected Intercession
The Rejected Intercession is one that
does not meet
the conditions
required for permission from Allah or His being pleased
(with the intercessor or the one for whom intercession is made), such as the
intercession which the people of
shirk
believe that their gods will be
able to do for them.  Many of them only worship their gods because they believe
that they will intercede for them with Allah, and that they are middle men
between them and Allah.  Allah says:
“Surely, the religion is for Allah only.  And those who take
protectors besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near
to Allah.’ Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they
differ.  Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever” (Quran
39:9)
Allah tells us that this kind of intercession is
ineffective and of no benefit:
“So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to
them” (Quran 74:48)
“And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not benefit
another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be
taken from him nor will they be helped.” (Quran 2:48)
“O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided
for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship,
nor intercession.  And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.” (Quran
2:254)
Hence, Allah did not accept the intercession of His
Khaleel
[1]
Ibrahim for his father Azar who was a pagan.  The Prophet said:
“Ibrahim will meet his father on the Day of
Resurrection, and Azar’s face will be dark and covered with dust.  Ibrahim will
say to him, ‘Did I not tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will say, ‘Today
I will not disobey you.'’ Ibrahim will say, ‘O Lord! You promised me not to
disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me
than cursing and dishonoring my father?’ Then Allah will say, ‘I have forbidden
Paradise to the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrahim, what is
beneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a
dhabh
(an
animal,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown into the
Fire.”
[2]
Wisdom of Intercession
The point of intercession is to honor the person
interceding.  It is Allah’s way of making the person stand out in front of His
creation.  That is the reason why Prophet Muhammad and the prophets will be
allowed to intercede as detailed above.
Furthermore, intercession should not make a person
complacent about sins.  A person must never think that he can rely on
intercession and sin all he wants!  For, he is not guaranteed that Allah will
allow someone to intercede for him.  Furthermore, his sins might lead him into
outright disbelief in which case no one’s intercession will benefit him.  Lastly,
he might receive punishment before he is interceded for and released.

Rakah
- unit of prayer.
Before we can examine the
events that Allah says will happen on the Day of Judgement we must ask
ourselves just when that Day will be.  And we are not the first generation to
ask that question.  Prophet Muhammad was asked many times by many people about
when this Day would arrive.  The answer now, even though we have made
remarkable advances in all forms of knowledge, particularly technology and
science, is still the same.  Allah alone knows when the hour that starts the
Day of Judgement will be.  When the angel Gabriel came to the Prophet in the
guise of a well-dressed man, one of the questions he asked was about the Hour. 
Prophet Muhammad answered that, “The one questioned about it knows no better
than the questioner.”
“Men ask you of the Hour, Say the knowledge of it is with
Allah only, what can convey to you that may be the Hour is near.” (Quran 33:63)
“Verily, the Hour is coming and My Will is to keep it hidden...”
(Quran 20:15)
Allah is concealing the date of the Day of Judgement
from us.  This verse alone should indicate to us that this is nothing less than
a momentous occasion of gargantuan proportions.  Although we do not know when
the Day of Judgement will be, Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (may the mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon him) have described in detail what will happen
on that Day.  In this and the following two lessons we will describe the events
of the Day of Judgement as they are described to us in the Quran and the
authentic
a
hadith
.
Blowing the Trumpet.
The Day of Judgment will come upon humankind suddenly.   No
matter how well informed or interested someone is in the signs that will precede
it, its commencement will come as a shock.  The trumpet will be blown and the
people will hear a sound so horrendous that the mountains and the earth itself
will crumble to dust.
“And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast, and the
earth and the mountains are removed from their places, and crushed with a single
crushing, then on that Day shall the (Great) Event befall.” (Quran 69:13-15)
Allah says that it will be a single shout, a long
continuous sound that will not cease until everything has perished
(Quran
38:15)
.  It will then be followed by a second blowing of the trumpet.  Behold,
Allah tells us that everyone who has ever lived will find themselves standing,
staring, and shocked by the events.
“And the trumpet will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens
and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills.  Then it
will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on!” (Quran
39:68)
The Standing
The trumpet is blown, the earth is rolled up like a
scroll and the dead rise.  Bones and body parts join together, brains begin to
work.  Truly humankind has been returned to Allah.  All of humankind were dead,
those who died before the blowing of the trumpet and those who died in the
cataclysmic event that levelled the earth to a plane.  The Day of Judgement has
begun.  People stand in groups, staring ahead.
“Every soul will taste death.  Then to Us will you be returned”
(Quran 29:57)
“ Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes.  [We
are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips!” (Quran 75:3-4)
Once the initial shock of being returned to life begins
to wear off, the reality of the situation begins to set in.  The veil of the
physical world has been removed.  The deeds we did are set out for us to see.
“So
whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.  And whoever does an atom’s
weight of evil will see it.”
(Quran 99:7, 8)
Another promise of
Allah’s fulfilled.  Some people are happy with their situation others begin to
tremble in fear.
A person’s deeds will determine their length of the
standing but all people waiting will be  barefoot, naked, and uncircumcised.
Ahadith
tell us that this standing in fear and trepidation could be as long as 50,000
years
[1]
but for a
pious person it might be as little as the time it takes to pray two
rakahs
of prayer.  The people waiting will be frightened, their hearts beating like
drums in their chests and ears.  They will run about as if in a drunken state
and care nothing about anyone but themselves.  Parents, spouses and children
will be long forgotten.  Gripped by fear they will begin to question their
situation.
“He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind,
while I had sight (before)?’ [Allah] will say, ‘This is how it is: Our signs came
unto you, but you disregarded them, and thus will you this Day be forgotten.’”
(Quran 20:125)
Prophet Muhammad informs us that on the Day of Judgement
the sun will be bought near to humankind.  The sun would only be a mile away
and the peopl"

Waiting for what is to come.
On the Day of Judgement, after the
trumpet has been blown and the bodies of all humanity have been resurrected the
people stand on a wide open plane waiting for the judgment to begin.  They will
be distressed and their hearts remain filled with fear and remorse.  They will
be confused and in utter disbelief.   Allah tells us that this will be a time,
“When
sight is confounded, and the moon is eclipsed (hidden from view), and the sun
and the moon are brought together.” (Quran 75:7-9)
.  The people are
gathered under an eerie light and will be made to wait.  This is a day when the
heavens will be rent asunder and the
“…and the angels will be sent down, a
grand descent.”
(Quran 25:25)
The angels are sent down in rows, a
grand descent as Quran describes it.  Both the people and the angels stand in
rows waiting for the judgement and time is not behaving as the people expect.  The
standing seems interminable, will it ever end?
“And the angels will be on its sides, and
eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.  On that
Day you will be brought to judgement and none of your secrets will remain
hidden.” (Quran 69: 17-18)
On this Day even those whose light shines
through their faces will fear to stand before Allah and those who are shaded by
the grace of Allah remain fearful of the momentous occasion.  The people’s
distress on this Day of Reckoning will become so intense that they will run to
various prophets begging for their intercession and ask Allah to begin the
judgment.
The Prophets
[1]
The people will be gathered together in
groups or individually, caring nothing for those around them.  “Who will help
us!” they cry and turn to the prophets.  They will rush to Adam, the father of
humanity and beg for his intercession on their behalf but Adam is also afraid. 
They will say, “Please Adam you are the one to whom the angels prostrated”, but
Adam, peace be upon him, will reply “Myself myself” and he tells the people that
his Lord is angry like never before, go to Prophet Ibrahim.
The people will go to Ibrahim and beg, “You
are the one who is beloved by Allah, please ask Him to start judgment”.  Ibrahim
will reply just as Adam did, “Myself, myself.  Today my Lord is angry like
never before, go to Musa”.  Then they will go to Prophet Musa, begging for the
judgment to start.  In mental and physical pain, sweat dripping down their
bodies, hearts thumping, the people will continue in the same vein and Musa
will send them to Prophet Isa.  Each Prophet is fearful of Allah and concerned
about his own punishment.
The people will then surge to Prophet Isa
begging for his help.  “You were created by Allah’s command; you talked to people
from the cradle, intercede for us before your Lord!” Prophet Isa will respond
in exactly the same way as the others.  Even though he is the slave of Allah,
and even though he ascended to Allah after his time on earth, Prophet Isa too
will be concerned for his own judgment.   “Myself, myself.  Today my Lord is
angry like never before so go to Muhammad, the final prophet”.
The people will rush to Prophet
Muhammad, and say to him, “you are the last of the prophets and our final hope,
please ask Allah to start judgment!”  He replies, “I’ll go, I’ll go”.
What happens next can be found in an authentic
hadith
.   Prophet Muhammad goes to his Lord, Allah.  “Then I will ask my
Lord for permission and He will give me permission, and He will inspire me with
words of praise with which I will praise Him, words that I do not know now.  So
I will praise Him with those words of praise and I will fall down prostrate
before Him.  He will say, ‘O Muhammad! Raise your head; ask, for it will be
given to you, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.’ I will
raise my head and say, ‘My
Ummah
, O Lord! My
Ummah
, O Lord!’ …”
[2]
This is what is known as the greatest
intercession, it is
al-maqaam al-mahmood
, Prophet Muhammad
intercedes for the people that Allah might relieve them of the horrors and
begin the judgement.
“...  so that your Lord may raise you to
Maqaam
Mahmood
(a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on
the Day of Resurrection)” (Quran 17:79)
Hell and Paradise are bought close.
Before Judgement commences however,
Hell must be bought forth.  The angels and all of humanity are standing,
waiting, becoming increasingly distressed, worried only about themselves,
pleading for help and Hell is brought close.  The people are already distressed
to the point of hysteria but those who a"

Your new everlasting life is about to begin.  This is
the Day of Judgment.  All of humanity will be judged by Allah according to
their beliefs and deeds. This is the culmination of the message of all the
prophets.  Worship One God and know that you will one day be accountable for
all that you say and do. This day has arrived. It is a shock, all of humanity are
standing together in awe. What happens now?
“Verily, We have warned you of a near torment, the Day when
man will see that (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth, and the
disbeliever will say: ‘Woe to me! Would that I were dust!’"" (Quran 78:40)
The Scales of Justice
The scales of justice sometimes referred to as the
balances or the scale of deeds will be set up and each deed will be weighed and
tallied.
No deed even an atom’s weight will be overlooked whether
it be the backbiting that was forgotten or the kind word that was said without
thinking.
“Whoever brings a good deed shall be rewarded ten times the
like of it, and he that does evil shall only be rewarded the like of it, and
they shall not be wronged.” (Quran 6:160).
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, also reminded us of the mercy of Allah. He said, ‘There is nothing
that will be placed in the Balance that will weigh more heavily than a good conduct.
The one who has a good conduct will attain thereby the status of one who fasts
and prays (a great deal).’
[1]
The Book of Deeds
""‘…Woe to us! what sort of book is this that leaves
neither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!’ and
they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no
one with injustice. (Quran 18:49)
Each person will be given a book in either their right
or left hand. Everything we do in this world has been recorded by angels. The
good and the bad, things we have forgotten or never given a thought to, it is
all recorded and Allah might choose to question us about each and every word.
Those who are given the book in their right hand will begin to relax and feel
happy and honoured.
“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right
hand, He surely, will receive an easy reckoning, And will return to his family
in joy!” But whosoever is given his Record behind his back He will invoke (for
his) destruction, And he shall enter a blazing Fire”(Quran 84:7-12)
Sadly though, many will receive their book in their
left hand or behind their back. And the fear rises.
The Accounting
The first thing that each person will be questioned
about is his prayer.Prayer is what is known as one of the rights we owe
to Allah. Each person will be asked about the quality of their prayers. This is
confirmed and reinforced by the words of Prophet Muhammad.
It is recorded in an authentic
hadith
that
Prophet Muhammad said, “The first thing the people will be held accountable for
on the Day of Judgment is prayer, Allah will say to His angels (even though He
already knows), ‘Look at my slave’s prayers. Were they complete or not?’ If
they were complete it will be written as complete. If they were not fully
complete Allah will say: ‘See if my slave has voluntary prayers’, if he has
them Allah will say, ‘Complete the shortage in his obligatory prayers with his
voluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same
manner.”
[2]
The words of Prophet Muhammad help us to paint a very
clear picture in our minds of what will happen to us when we stand before Allah
on the Day of Accounting. He also said, “The son of Adam will be questioned by
Allah about five things: how he lived his life, and how he utilized his youth, by
what means did he earn his wealth, how did he spend his wealth, and what did he
do with his knowledge.”
[3]
We should be grateful that we are able to prepare
ourselves adequately before the great Day occurs, as we even know the type of
questions that we will be asked and the types of behavior that we will be
questioned about.  The good believer prepares for this difficult event, so that
he or she will not be among those whose body parts testify against them.
""On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their
feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.” (Quran 24:24)
“And they will say to their skin, ‘Why did you bear witness
against us?’ They"

The grave is the abode of the
body after death and death is something we will all experience.  There is no
denying this or hiding from it.  Death will come to each and every one of us.  Some
will die earlier in their lifespan than others, according to the will of Allah
but everyone who lives will die at his appointed time, whether he is amongst
the pious or wicked.  Therefore it is important that each and every one of us
understands what will happen after we die.  We die and we are buried but that
is not the end, on the contrary it is just the beginning.
“Every soul shall taste death...” (Quran 3:185)
The prophets of Allah called their people to worship One
God, Allah the Almighty, and they also taught the people to believe in life
after death.  It was thought of as an extremely important concept, so much so
that failure to believe in it rendered all beliefs meaningless.  In accordance
with this, one of the 'pillars of faith' is belief in life after death.  This
life is often referred to as the Hereafter, and the first stage of the Hereafter
is life in the grave.
In an authentic
hadith
Prophet Muhammad said, “The
grave is the first stage of the Hereafter …”
[1]
With this in mind it is important to remember that this worldly life is a
series of trials and tests that determine our place in the Hereafter.  All
actions are recorded and they form the basis of any punishment or reward a
person is destined to receive.
“This is because of that (evil) which your hands have sent
before you.  And certainly, Allah is never unjust to (His) slaves.” (Quran 3:182)
“This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit
because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world).” (Quran 43:72)
Life in the grave is often referred to as life in the
Barzakh
.
Barzakh
literally means an obstacle, hindrance or
something that separates one thing from another such as this following
description in the Quran:
“He has let loosed the two seas (the salt water and the sweet)
meeting together. Between them is a barrier (
Barzakh
), which none of
them can transgress.” (Quran 55:19-20)
As such it is a barrier that cannot be crossed except by
the permission of Allah.  In the context of life and death,
Barzakh
is the
period between a person's death and his resurrection on Judgment Day.  The very
nature of life in the
Barzakh
is a matter of the
ghayb
and thus its
details are known to Allah alone.  However Allah did reveal some matters of the
ghayb
to Prophet Muhammad and he in turn conveyed those things to us.
After any burial Prophet Muhammad would remind his
companions to ask forgiveness for their brother or sister, and to ask Allah
that they remain steadfast at the time of questioning.
[2]
This was
because Prophet Muhammad said that what comes after the burial could be very
difficult indeed.   After informing his
sahabi
that the grave is the
first stage of the Hereafter, Prophet Muhammad said, “…if one finds salvation
(at this stage) the succeeding (stages) become easy for him, and if he does not
find salvation in it, what follows this stage is very hard upon him.” Prophet
Muhammad’s beloved wife Aisha recalls that the Prophet used to regularly seek
refuge with Allah from the torment and tribulations of the grave.
[3]
And it is
understood by the scholars of Islam that the tribulations refer to the
questioning.
Thus it would be pertinent for us to follow his example
and seek refuge with Allah from being punished in the grave.  Prophet Muhammad himself,
in a relatively long but very descriptive and informative
hadith
explains
very clearly what will happen before the questioning.  It was a subject that
the
sahabah
were very interested in and they describe themselves as
sitting like birds, meaning they were quiet and still, when listening to
Prophet Muhammad talk about the life in the grave.

“
When the believing
slave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to
him angels with white faces like the sun, and they sit around him as far as the
eye can see.  They bring with them shrouds from Jannah (Heavenly Abode) and
perfumes from Jannah.  Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and
he says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure.’
Then it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a water-skin.  When
he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant bef"

·To understand the nature of the questions
asked in the grave.
Arabic Terms:
·
Hadith
- (plural – ahadith) is a
piece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, and his companions.
The scene for the disbelievers
is very different.  The angels come to a disbeliever “…with dark faces,
bringing sackcloth, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see.  Then
the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O evil soul, come
forth to the wrath of Allah and His anger.’  Then his soul disperses inside his
body, and then comes out cutting the veins and nerves, like a skewer passing
through wet wool.  When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an
instant before they take it and put it in that sackcloth, and there comes from
it a stench like the foulest stench of a dead body on the face of the earth.  Then
they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is
this evil soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so’, calling
him by the worst names by which he was known in this world, until they reach
the lowest heaven.  They ask for it to be opened to them and it is not opened.”
 Then Allah records his place as being in the lowest depths of hell.
Once the soul has been reunited with the body, the dead
person is visited in their grave by two angels.   In an authentic
hadith
Prophet Muhammad tells us that these angels are black and blue and named Munkar
and Nakeer.  The angels will ask three questions that will affirm a person’s
faith and at the same time lay bare their piousness or wickedness.  This is a
very important stage because it sets the scene for the whole of a person’s life
in the Hereafter.  The angels ask who is your Lord, what is your religion and
who is your Prophet? Or as in some
ahadith
it is said that the question
will be who is this man who was sent amongst you?  As you can see these
questions concern matters of faith
.
If a person answers, my Lord is
Allah, my religion is Islam, my prophet is Muhammad … a voice calls out from
heaven, “My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and
clothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.” If the deceased
does not know the correct answer to the questions, then a voice calls out from
heaven, “Prepare for him a bed from Hell and clothe him from Hell, and open for
him a gate to Hell.  ”
The questioning confirms exactly what a person has
understood since the moment of death.  Good really will be rewarded and evil
will be punished.  And thus the believer is immediately rewarded with an
opening that appears in his grave.  Through the opening the person can see the
grandeur and bounties waiting for him in Paradise.  His good deeds will come to
him in the form of a well-dressed, handsome , finely perfumed man.  The grave
will be widened as far as the eye can see, it will be well-lit and filled with
greenery; he will long to tell his family of his good fortune.  The believer
will sleep peacefully in his grave.  Prophet Muhammad mentioned in a
hadith
that the believer will be told to look at his place in the Hellfire and
understand that it has been exchanged for a place in Paradise.  “So he will
look at them both.  Then his grave will be widened for him to a distance of
seventy cubits, and it will be filled with greenery until the Day of
Resurrection”.
In contrast, grave of the disobedient will be filled
with darkness.  The disbeliever’s punishment begins with his bad deeds taking
the form of a repulsive looking man and an opening through which he can see the
ugliness of Hell.
Reward and punishment are mighty motivators and the
thought of spending an unspecified amount of time being punished even before
the Day of Judgment arrives is a fearful thing.
The Prophet said “When any one of you dies, he is shown
his eternal abode every morning and evening.  If he is one of the people of
Paradise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the
people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is
your abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”
Imagine hearing those words.  This is your abode until
Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.  This is a moment that could
either be filled with joy or despair for the time may be long or short, as
Allah wills.  We have been warned and events of that day have been clearly set
out for us.  Those of us who are wise will take heed."

On the Day of Judgment the sun will
be brought low.  Prophet Muhammad informed us that, “The sun will get closer to
the earth until it is only a mile away and the people will perspire according
to the level of their deeds…”.
[1]
The people will be standing together, fearful and suffering from the effects
of the heat.  For a lucky few the suffering will last what feels like seconds,
for others they will begin to feel as if they have been standing in the
scorching rays of the sun for half a lifetime or more.  The lessons entitled “Events
on the Day of Judgement”
[2]
describe in more detail what people will
experience on that Day.   It mentions briefly that there are seven kinds of
people who will be in the shade; the shade of the Throne of Allah.  In these
lessons we will examine these groups of people in more detail.
Prophet Muhammad would talk to his followers about the
Day of Judgment.  He wanted them, and us who follow him today, to be prepared
for what is to come.  In a famous and much quoted
hadith
he reminded us
of the boundless mercy of Allah and seven types of people who would stand
serenely in the shade on the Day of Judgement.
“Allah will give shade to seven [people] on the Day when
there will be no shade other than His (Throne's) shade:  A just ruler; a youth
who grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the
mosques; two who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for that and parting
upon that; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for illegal
intercourse), but responds by saying, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in
charity and hides it, such that his left hand does not know what his right hand
gives in charity; and finally  a man who remembered Allah in private and wept.”
[3]
Before we continue, it is worth mentioning that in most
circumstances when ‘man’ is mentioned both in the Quran and
ahadith
it
refers to both men and women; except where women or men are addressed
separately and specifically.
1.A just ruler.
Justice is a fundamental concept in Islam, along with
tolerance, forgiveness and respect.   Justice means to give every person the
rights he is entitled to believer or non-believer, relative or stranger, friend
or enemy.  This is a concept that every Muslim must apply, not only the ruler. 
God emphasizes justice, and Islam condemns all forms of injustice and
oppression.
“…And do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being
just.  Be just; that is nearer to righteousness”.    (Quran: 5:8)
“…And God wills no injustice to the worlds.” (Quran 3:108)
Being just can put the ruler under a lot of pressure, he
must be careful of his own intentions and actions and he also bears some responsibility
for the actions taken under his authority.
2.A youth who grew up in the worship of Allah.
It is the youth who are the most energetic and
enthusiastic.  They have a zest for life and look to the future, planning and
laying foundations for a long and fruitful life.  Their liveliness and zeal are
great blessings from Allah and those who use this time wisely to gain knowledge
of Allah and perform acts that they may not be able to perform later in life
will be rewarded.  Amongst those rewards is to be shaded on the Day when there
is no shade.  Youthfulness however is also the time when a person is most
vulnerable to the temptations of life and the tricks of
Shaytan
.  There
are many worldly distractions specifically marketed to the young, so they must
keep their eyes on the prize and not be deluded by all that glitters and has no
substance.
We are reminded of this in another
hadith
where Prophet
Muhammad says, “Take advantage of five matters before five other matters: your
youth
before you become old; and your health, before you fall sick; and your wealth,
before you become poor; and your free time before you become busy; and your
life, before your death.”
[4]
3.A man whose heart is attached to the mosques.
Once again there are great rewards for praying in the
mosque.  In various
ahadith
we are reminded of this.  For a man praying
in the mosque has 27 times more reward than praying in the home.
[5]
Prophet
Muhammad said that a person… “does not take a step towards the mosque except
that because of it, he is raised by one rank and one sin is removed from him.  Then
when he prays, the angels do not ceas"

5.    A man who is called by a woman of beauty
and position (for illegal intercourse), but responds by saying, ‘I fear Allah’.
Please note that, as explained in
lesson 1, the same reward is given to a woman who is tempted by a man but
rebukes him saying, “I fear Allah”.  This world is full of temptations and
especially now, in the 21
st
century we are assaulted almost
constantly.  Our dependence on technology forces us to make hard choices.  We
can choose to be led around by the nose by
Shaytan
and his minions or we
can choose righteousness.  The attraction of one gender to the other is an age
old problem, an age old temptation, and many people have been lured into
destruction by failing to resist a thing of beauty.  This is why we find the
rewards for restraint mentioned so often in the
aayaat
(verses) of the
Quran and why Prophet Muhammad warned his
Ummah
about the danger of not
learning self-control.
“But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and
restrained himself from impure evil desires, and lusts. Verily, Paradise will
be his abode.” (Quran 79:40-41)
People enter Paradise, due generally to their
taqwa
of Allah, full respect and obedience to the commands of Allah, and based on
their good conduct.  Most however enter the Hellfire because of the ill use of
the mouth and private parts”.
[1]
Something that is guaranteed to strengthen our resolve
to stay well away from the temptation of the opposite gender is ‘fear of Allah’.
Taqwa
is the word often used to define the concept of fear of Allah.  Prophet
Yusuf (Joseph) was a man with
taqwa
.  It is said that he will be one of
the leaders of the people shaded by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  His way of
dealing with the temptation of the seductress that was his employer’s wife is a
fine example for all of us.  When he found himself tempted by her beauty he
sought refuge with Allah.
“Indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her
desire had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.   Thus, it was that We might
turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse.   Surely, he was one of
Our chosen, guided slaves.” (Quran 12:24)
6.    A man who gives in charity and hides it,
such that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity.
Charity in Islam takes two forms:
zakah
, compulsory
charity and
sadaqah
, voluntary charity.
Zakah
holds such a high
position that throughout the Quran it is often coupled with prayer.  Islam
places great emphasis on the need to give
sadaqah
and
zakah
and
it places great emphasis and great reward on giving these two forms of charity
in secret.  To give in secret preserves the dignity of those who receive and it
also prevents the giver from seeking praise and acknowledgment.  Islam tells us
that giving in secret is by far the superior way but that should not detract
from giving publicly which is also a very desirous and rewardable act however
deliberately drawing attention to one’s charitable deeds is a very undesirable
quality.
Wealth is something that Allah can give to us at any time;
however He can also take it away without even a moment’s notice.  We all know
people that have plunged into bankruptcy overnight.  Because of the high
position charity holds in Islam it is important that we spend our wealth in the
way of Allah before we do not have the means to do so.
The likeness of those who spend their money for Allah’s sake,
is as the likeness of a grain (of corn), it grows seven ears, every single ear
has a hundred grains, and God multiplies (increases the reward) for whom He
wills, and Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All Knower.  (Quran
2:261)
7.    A man who remembers Allah in private and
weeps.
Prophet Muhammad said, “There are two eyes which will
not be touched by the fire, an eye which weeps out of fear of Allah and an eye
that stays alert throughout the night guarding for the sake of Allah”.
[2]
In the first type are those people whose eyes overflow
with tears when they remember Allah.  They weep when they contemplate the sins
that"

Honors of Adam
Allah favored Adam (Quran 3:33) over
other people with some great qualities:
1.Adam was the father of all human beings.  Allah chose him to be
the father of all human beings as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said, “All of you are the children of Adam and Adam was
created from soil.”
[1]
2.Allah created Adam with His Hands.  Addressing Satan, Allah
said, “What prevented you from prostrating yourself to the one whom I created
with both My hands?” (Quran 38:75).
3.Allah created the soul breathed into Adam.  Allah had His angel,
Gabriel, breathe life into him (Quran 15:29, 38:72).
4.Allah had the angels prostrate to Adam (Quran 15:29, 38:72).
5.Allah gave him great amount of knowledge, surpassing what He
gave to the angels (Quran 2:31).
6.Allah gave him residence in Paradise along with his wife, Eve,
and allowed them to enjoy there (Quran 2:35).
7.Adam was the first Prophet to human beings.  Prophet Muhammad said,
“…Adam was a Prophet and received revelation.”
[2]
8.Adam shared one religion with all other Prophets and called to
the same religion, Islam.  They all invited to belief in Allah and worshipping
Allah alone (Quran 21:25, 16:36).
Creation of Adam
Allah told the angels that He was planning to establish
a ‘khalifah’
[3]
on
Earth.  ‘Khalifah’ is a person who is succeeded by others.  They immediately
understood that it would not be Adam alone who will live on Earth, but rather,
it would be a long chain of human beings, many of them will be wicked:
“And (mention, O Muhammad), when your Lord said to the angels,
‘Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.’ They said, ‘Will
You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we
declare Your praise and sanctify You?’ Allah said, ‘Indeed, I know that which
you do not know.’” (Quran 2:31)
The question by the angels was not meant to question
Allah’s wisdom or a result of envy or hatred for humans.  They simply wanted to
understand the purpose of Adam’s creation.  Allah’s response tells us that in
His perfect knowledge, He knew things about Adam that the angels could not
imagine.
The angels feared that Adam was unworthy of becoming a
khalifah
on Earth, Allah
proved to them that it was incorrect and the new creation can surpass them in
knowledge.  The Quran 2:31-33 recounts that Allah taught Adam names of all
created things that the angels did not know.  Allah emphasized to them that
their knowledge is limited and they could only know what He taught them.  When
Adam defeated the angels in the ‘contest of knowledge,’ he earned their respect. 
Thus, they rushed to prostrate to Adam when commanded by Allah.
More On the Creation of Adam
Allah tells us in the Quran 20:55 and 30:20 that He
created us from soil.  Allah gathered different types and colors of soil from
which Adam was to be created.  The Prophet said, ‘Indeed, Adam was created from
three types of solids: black, white, and red.’
[4]
The soil gathered for Adam’s creation was then turned
into clay as mentioned in the Quran 6:2.  The clay was sticky (Quran 37:11).  After
Adam’s clay dried, it became sort of like pottery, making a sound when tapped
(Quran 15:26).
After forming Adam’s clay, Allah fashioned it and set it
in Paradise for a certain duration before He gave it life.  “Satan started
circling the clay, examining its nature.  When he realized it was hollow, he
thought, ‘I’ll conquer this, for it is a creation that cannot hold together.’
‘Cannot hold together’ means that he cannot control himself against desires.
Adam was much larger in size than what human beings are today. 
The Prophet said, ‘Allah created Adam sixty cubits tall, then mankind kept
getting shorter until (it reached a stable height) now.’ (Bukhari, Muslim)
Thus, human beings did not go through stages of evolution.
In several verses of the Quran (2:117, 3:47, 6:73,
16:40, 19:35, 36:82.  40:68), Allah indicates that He brings into existence
with a mere word or command.  Sometimes, instead of fulfilling His command
directly, Allah creates means for fulfilling them.  For people, Allah sends
angels to breathe life into them.  In the case of Adam and Jesus, Allah sent Gabriel
to breathe life into them (Quran 15:29, 38:72).
Life was blown into Adam on Friday.  The Prophet said,
‘Indeed, among your best days is Friday.  On it, Adam was created, and on it he
died.  Also, on it will be the Blow of the Horn and the Shock causing every"

Adam’s Wife
Soon after creating Adam, Allah created his wife, Hawwa
or Eve.  From them, Allah brought forth all human beings (Quran 49:13).  Hawwa
was created from Adam’s rib.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, said, “Take good care of women, because the (first) woman was
created from a bent rib (of Adam), and the most curved part of a rib is its
upper end.  If you insist on straightening it, you will break it and if you
leave it, it will remain bent.  So take good care of women.” (Bukhari)
Adam’s Children
After creating Adam, Allah extracted all his descendants
from his backbone (Quran 7:172).  The Prophet  said, “When Allah created Adam,
He wiped his back, dropping from it every person of Adam’s offspring He would
create until Resurrection Day.”
[1]
Allah Commands Angels to Prostrate to Adam
Allah commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam after He
blew life into Adam.  Allah said to them,
“So when I have proportioned him (Adam) and breathed into him
My soul, fall down before him in prostration.” (Quran 15:29, 38:72)
After giving life to Adam, Allah issued the command to
the angels to prostrate before Adam,
“(Note) when We told the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves before
Adam.’” (Quran 2:34, 17:61, 18:50, 20:116)
When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam,
Satan (or
Iblees
in Arabic) was among them.  The angels immediately
prostrated, but
Iblees
refused (Quran 2:34, 20:116, 15:30-31).  His
first sin was disobeying Allah’s command of prostration.
Iblees
was
never an angel (Quran 18:50); he was a
jinn
but lived among the angels. 
Instead of showing remorse and repenting for his behavior, Allah says,
“So they (the angels) prostrated themselves, except for
Iblees
,
who refused, was arrogant, and (thus) became of the disbelievers.” (Quran 2:34)
Allah gave him a chance to repent; however,
Iblees
went deeper into disobedience and rebellion.  To justify his arrogance, Satan
said that he was better than Adam because fire is better than clay.
Allah expelled
Iblees
from Paradise as punishment.
Iblees
recognized that he deserved immediate
punishment for his outright disbelief and disobedience, but he requested that
his punishment be postponed until Judgement Day.  Allah granted his request for
a great wisdom.
Iblees
announced his evil plan to mislead humanity. 
He announced boastfully to Allah,
“(
Iblees
) said, ‘Because You have put me in error, I
will surely lie in ambush for them (humans) along Your straight path.  I will
then surely assault them from before them and from behind them and from their
right and from their left, and You will find most of them ungrateful (to
You).’” (Quran 7:16-17)
Iblees
blamed Allah for his misfortune, even
though Allah did not take away his freedom of choice.  Allah’s wisdom dictated
that
Iblees
be the trial ‘machine’ for human beings and he was given
extraordinary powers over human beings, but it’s limitation is that he will not
be able to subdue Allah’s true servants.
Allah permitted
Iblees
to pursue his plan.  Once he has
completed his evil scheme, he will abide in Hell with his followers from the
jinn
and human beings (Quran 7:18).
Adam and Hawwa in Paradise
Allah let Adam and Eve dwell in Paradise, the best
residence.  He gave them permission to enjoy its bounties without restriction. 
However, Allah prohibited them from eating one specific fruit,
“We said, ‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and
eat therefrom in abundance from wherever you wish.  But do not approach this
very tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.’” (Quran 2:35)
Soon after Adam and Hawwa started living in Paradise,
Satan unleashed his cunning deception on them.  The two were innocent and did

their innocence to his advantage.  Satan suggested to them that they could be
like the angels or live eternally in Paradise.  Adam and Hawwa were overcome
with desire and fell into Satan’s trick and ate from the forbidden tree.  As
soon as they did, their private parts became exposed (Quran 2:36).An
immediate outcome of disobedience is the stripping away of the spiritual

Nuh
– Arabic name for Prophet Noah.
The name Noah is familiar to all three monotheistic
faiths prevalent in the world today, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In Islam
the story of Prophet Noah and the flood is very similar to what is found in the
Bible, however the Quran tends to go into greater detail.   When this is
combined with the stories told in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad we are
able to build up a better picture of the life of Prophet Nuh and learn some
very valuable lessons that are as relevant today as they were all those years
ago.
Prophet Nuh lived in a time very similar to our own.  Sin
and lawlessness had seemingly overtaken the people.  Righteous people seemed
very few and those who adhered to the religion of their ancestor Adam were weak
and often oppressed.  It sounds a little bit like the world we live in today
where those who profess belief in God are often ridiculed and belittled and committing
sin is thought of as fun.
Nuh was a charismatic speaker and enthralled the people
with stories of the creation and the mysteries of the universe, however when he
tried to warn his people of a just yet terrible punishment they became angry
and resentful.  These were the first people who had deviated from the true
religion yet when Nuh warned them of the punishment of Allah, his words fell on
deaf ears.  Despite ridicule and mockery Nuh continued, for a period of 950
years, to call his people back to the worship of the one true God.
Lesson 1
Do not ever give up.
Do not ever abandon or cut yourself off from family or
friends because of their disbelief, because Allah only knows when your words or
actions might flip the switch that leads them to the path of salvation.
We all know the story of the flood.   It was told in
almost every ancient civilisation and as mentioned already, forms part of the
religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Allah instructed Nuh to build an
ark and passed judgement on the disbelievers in the form of a flood.   It is a
story quite often thought of as a child’s story, but this story has many layers
of meaning and is relevant for adults. Allah, the Exalted, says:
“And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our
Inspiration and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are
surely to be drowned.” (Quran11:37)
When the water started to fall from the sky and gush
from the earth, for this was no ordinary storm, Allah commanded Nuh to enter
the ark with his family, the believers and a pair of every known animal, bird
or insect.  The disbelievers watched incredulously, still jeering and mocking,
but the words stuck in their throats when the water began to rise, and rise,
and rise.
Lesson 2
There is no power and strength except from Allah.  He is the All-Powerful. 
If He decrees a thing, nothing can prevent it.
While worldly might, strength or respect might seem of
consequence, the reality is that we are weak and needy; what little control we
have over our world and our affairs pales in comparison to the might and
majesty of Allah.
Nuh’s wife did not join him on the ark, for she had
never really believed in the message he had been preaching for so long.   Neither
did his eldest son, an idol worshiper who preferred to climb the highest
mountain he could find, but the water kept rising and rising.  Prophet Nuh
could see his son being overtaken by the waves of water and cried out to him to
embark the ark.   But his son refused, and he drowned.
“And Nuh called out to his son, who had separated himself
(apart), ‘O my son!  Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.’  The son
replied, ‘I will betake myself to a mountain; it will save me from the water.’ 
Nuh said: ‘Today there is no refuge from Allah’s command, except for those on
whom He has mercy.’  And a wave came in between them so he (the son) was among
the drowned.” (Quran 11:42-43)
The examples of Nuh’s interactions with his idolatrous
son and non-believing wife confirm the previous lessons and add a third lesson.
Lesson 3
We choose what we want to believe and how we want to act.
Although we are undoubtedly born with an innate need to
connect with Allah, our spiritual identity is not a forgone conclusion.  We all
reach an age when we can choose our faith, no matter what religion we were born
into.  Once chosen we then live with the consequences of that decision.
On his deathbed Nuh called his remaining sons to his
side and counseled them.
‘Indeed I would give you far reaching advice.  I charge
you to believe that there is no true god but Allah and that if the seven
heavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale and the words “there
is no true god but Allah “ were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the
former.  I warn you against associating partners with God and against arrogance.”

The large majority of Nuh’s people rejected his message,
but the message survives in t"

Dictionary.com defines a miracle as an effect
or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or
natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause.  Islam however
attributes these extraordinary events to the power of Allah.  A miracle is an astonishing
act that can only come about due to direct intervention from Allah Himself.  They
are events brought about by, connected to, or performed by prophets.  Miracles
are not magic, nor are they events bought about by righteous people.  Magic is
by definition a trick or an illusion; whereas, the sometimes unexplained events
brought about by learned righteous people are called
karamat
.
God sent prophets primarily to guide humankind.   They
were humans of outstanding character that the people could emulate and look to
for direction.   They were not gods, demi-gods or saints; they were human
beings charged with a difficult task.   They at times possessed exceptional
characteristics and qualities because they had to face unanticipated trials and
tribulations in order to spread their message to worship Allah Alone.
In order to support His prophets Allah sometimes gave
them extraordinary power.  The Arabic word for miracle is
mu’jizah
meaning
something unique that cannot be resisted.  The miracles granted to the prophets
were not only unique, they were  also pertinent and understandable to the
people to whom they were sent.  When they saw a miracle they knew that it could
not have been performed by an ordinary man.
In the time of Prophet Moses magic and sorcery were very
common in the land of Egypt therefore Moses’ miracles, such as the staff
turning into a serpent and his hand glowing, appealed to the people he was sent
to guide.  Prophet Moses’ encounter with the magicians at Pharaoh’s court
explains the difference between magic and miracles.  When the magicians whose
serpents were a result of trickery and illusion (magic) saw Moses produce a
real serpent they knew at once that it was a miracle.  That is why they fell
down and prostrated to Allah despite knowing that Pharaoh would have them put
to death.
At the time of Jesus, the Israelites were very
knowledgeable in the field of medicine thus  Prophet Jesus’ miracles included
returning sight to the blind, healing lepers and raising the dead.
“And you heal those born blind and the lepers by My leave.   And
behold!  You bring forth the dead by My leave.” (Quran 5:10)
A miracle performed by Allah at the request of Prophet
Jesus explains why Islam says that there are two types of miracles.  Jesus
asked Allah to provide him and his disciples with a table of food.  This event
is discussed in
Surah
5 of the Quran entitled Al-Maidah (The Table Spread). 
It is an example of a miracle performed at the request, or suggestion of the
people, in order to test the truth of the message.
“Jesus, son of Mary!  Can your Lord send down to us a table
spread (with food) from heaven?” (Quran 5:112)
The disciples wanted to spread the message of Jesus by
proclaiming the miracles they witnessed with their own eyes.  Another example
of this type of miracle is when Prophet Saleh’s people requested he bring out
from behind the mountain a she-camel and her offspring.
“We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did
her wrong.” (Quran 17:59)
The second type of miracle occurs without suggestion.  It
includes anything similar to what happened when the tree trunk cried and longed
for Prophet Muhammad.   The
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad contains many
other miracles such as water flowing from his (Prophet Muhammad’s) fingers and
trees deliberating shading him.  Prophet (King) Solomon’s life was also filled
with miracles and wonder.  His kingdom and his abilities were beyond the
capabilities of a human thus clearly showing that God provided him with
miracles that made him stand out among others and confirmed his nobility and
prophethood.   His army consisted of battalions of men,
jinn
and birds.

Ibrahim
- the Arabic word for
Abraham.
·
Shaytan
- sometimes spelled
Shaitan
or
Shaytaan
.  It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to
denote the devil or
Satan
, the personification of evil.
Prophet Ibrahim was a
Prophet of Allah and he has the honour of being described by Allah as
Khalil-Allah
which means the
one whom God chose for His love.
Throughout various chapters of the Quran Ibrahim is
praised as a paradigm of righteousness.  He was a man whose character is an example
to all believers; he was kind, forbearing, brave and trustworthy. Allah
describes him as such, He says:
Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly
obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who
associate others with Allah. (He was) thankful for His (Allah's) Graces. He
(Allah) chose him and guided him to a Straight Path. And We gave him good in
this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. (Quran
16: 120-122)
Lesson 1
Parents can learn from their children and elders can learn
from the youth.
Knowledge and understanding is not necessarily something
that comes with age and just because a person is older does not mean that he or
she is someone to emulate. The way Prophet Ibrahim interacted with his father
is a very good example of a child respecting his parent yet rejecting his (the
parent’s) ways and lifestyle.
And (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father, Azar: “Do you
take idols as gods? Verily, I see you and your people in manifest error!” (Quran
6: 74)
Ibrahim’s father Azar was a sculptor of idols, so from a
young age Ibrahim was aware that idols were nothing more than pieces of wood or
stone – inanimate objects that could extend no benefit or harm. He found it
extraordinary that people would worship them as gods!
Ibrahim tried to convince his father that his practice
of idol worship was wrong and ultimately useless. He  spoke to him in a gentle
voice, using kind words, and he tried to warn him of the dangers inherent in
worshipping idols, but his father only became annoyed and then angry.
When he said to his father: ""O my father! Why do you
worship that which cannot hear or see and cannot avail you in anything? O my
father! Verily! I have received knowledge that you have not received, so follow
me. I will guide you to a Straight Path. O my father, do not worship Satan.
Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient. O my father,
indeed I fear that you will be punished by the Most Merciful and would be a
companion to Satan in Hellfire."" He (the father) said: ""Do you reject
my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop this, I will indeed stone you. So get
away from me safely before I punish you."" (Quran 19: 42-46)
The child feared that his father would be lost and fall
into the clutches of
Shaytan
. He was wise beyond his years yet Ibrahim’s
father did not listen perhaps rejecting the fact that his child could guide and
teach him. Ibrahim did not lose his temper but instead responded to his
father’s threatening attitude with respect and wisdom.
[Abraham] said, ""Peace be upon you. I will implore my
Lord to forgive you. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me. And I shall turn away
from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allah. I will call upon my Lord
and it may well be that, in calling on my Lord, I will not be disappointed.” (Quran
19:47-48)
Lesson 2
Islam is logical.
From the perspective of Islam Prophet Ibrahim is not
considered to be either Jewish or a Christian; he is a Prophet who submitted to
Allah and thus is a Muslim. God tells us in the Quran that from an early age Prophet
Ibrahim felt compelled to find the One God Who was worthy of worship. He
realized that the idols his people worshipped, that were carved and sculptured
by his father were nothing but wood and stone. He knew instinctively that the
sun, moon and stars were not gods of any sort. Islam tells us that worshipping
Allah is the only logical conclusion that a person who examines the evidence,
can come to.  This is exactly what Ibrahim did. First he asked the wooden idols
to respond when he spoke to them and he then destroyed them. They could not speak
or protect themselves. Next he looked to the heavens and tried to find an
answer.
So when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star.
He said, ""This is my lord!"" But when it was no longer visible, he
said, ""I do not like those that disappear!"" When he saw the moon
rising, he said: ""This is my lord."" But when it was no longer visible,
he said: ""Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the people who
went astray."" When he saw the sun rising, he said: ""This is my lord.
This is greater."" But when it set, he said: ""O my people! I disown
all "
Glimpses from the Life of Prophet Lot,https://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/166/glimpses-from-life-of-prophet-lot,Events from the life of Prophet Lot.,Level 5 - Type:  Written Lesson - By  Aisha Stacey (© 2012 NewMuslims.com),Published on 03 Dec 2012 - Last modified on 17 Apr 2013,Printed: 439 - Emailed: 0 - Viewed: 46159 (daily average: ),Islamic Beliefs,https://www.newmuslims.com/category/131/islamic-beliefs,,,"Objective:
·To examine several events and learn valuable
lessons applicable in the 21st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Lut
- the Arabic name of Prophet Lot.
Many stories in the Quran
demonstrate the nature of Allah, some sections teach us about Paradise and Hell
and still other parts of Quran teach us lessons. These lessons are as relevant
today as they were in the time Quran was revealed or even further back in the
history of humankind.  The story of Prophet Lot in both the Bible and the Quran
are remarkably similar. The story of Prophet Lut is one that is particularly
pertinent to the 21st century yet people usually remember very little of the
story.
The story of Lut has over the centuries been reduced to
a morality tale, a parable warning people not to practice homosexuality. 
Usually all we hear is that Lut was a man of Allah living in the town of Sodom whose
people practiced the unnatural act of homosexuality, Allah called such
behaviour an abomination and destroyed the town but not before saving Lut and most
of his family.  However Lut’s story is much more than that, it is a story
filled with lessons for humankind. Let us take a glimpse into his life and see
what messages we are able to find and learn from it.
Lesson 1
Allah destroyed Sodom for crimes and sins we see around us
and accept every day.
We live in a world where murder is common, drugs are
readily available and young girls fall pregnant outside of the bonds of
marriage. Identities are stolen, sinful acts are called fun, and some streets
are unsafe to walk down even in the middle of the day. Paedophilia is rampant,
as is child pornography and human trafficking.  Degenerate lifestyles are
accepted and thought of as normal. Alcohol is easily available even to underage
children and is responsible for many of society’s ills. The people of Prophet
Lut lived in a society very similar to our own.
The town of Sodom was corrupt through and through. The
majority of people had no shame and considered sinful acts to be fun and
frivolity. Sodom was a party town, criminals and criminal activity abounded,
and those passing through the town risked robbery and physical abuse. Rape was
considered normal, homosexuality was considered fun and travellers expecting
hospitality usually got more than they bargained for. Sodom was the equivalent
of the district we avoid at night, perhaps even the suburb police will not
respond to in an emergency.
Lesson 2
To invite people to the truth with wisdom and kind words.
“Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom  and fair
preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better...” (Quran 16:125)
Allah sent Prophet Lot to this town with the message to
worship Allah alone.  He asked them to fear Allah and mend their evil ways
saying,
“Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?  Verily!  I am a trustworthy
Messenger to you.  So fear Allah and obey me” (Quran 26:161 - 163).
Lot
spoke using mild words; he condemned the actions not the people themselves and
encouraged them to seek forgiveness. There is surely a lesson for us in this.
Lot spoke mildly to people Allah described as evil and disobedient, thus we
should remember this when we are confronted with the evil acts people in the 21
st
century think of as fun. Condemn the act, not the person.  This was also the
way of Prophet Muhammad; he too would speak harshly about the action, not about
the person who did the action.
Lesson 3
Allah is the All-Seeing.
Sadly however, in Sodom, Lut’s words fell on deaf ears
because the people were content with their corrupt ways and had no desire to
curb them.  The people of Sodom committed their sins openly and had no shame,
they cared not whether anyone saw their sinful actions so it did not bother
them that Allah was watching. No matter whether we try to disguise or hide our
sins Allah sees everything, nothing can be hidden from the Almighty. Thus if we
are ashamed of our actions and wish that Allah did not witness our behaviour it
is  probably time to rethink,  and  find a way to act that is more pleasing to Allah.
Lesson 4
Believers should be hospitable.
When the angels came into the town of Sodom they
appeared to the people as very attractive male travellers. The first person they
spoke to was one of Lut’s daughters. She was afraid for them and asked that
they wait for her father in order for him to see them to safety. When Lut met
the strangers he could not convince them to bypass the town so he tried to keep
them safe in his own home.  Lut did not know that his guests were angels sent
by Allah, yet he feared for them more than his own safety. When the men of
Sodom rioted outside his house, demanding that the strangers be delivered into
their hands, Lut opposed them.
The goodness in hospitality comes from giving for no
other reason than to please Allah. The person you help may never be in a
position to help you and in some cases he may even bring you harm, however in
Islam hospitality is a triangular relationship between the host, the stranger

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Yusuf and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply
to our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Yusuf
- the Arabic name for Prophet Joseph.
·
Yaqub
– the Arabic name for Prophet Jacob.
·
Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
·
Sabr
- patience and it comes from a
root word meaning to stop, detain,  or refrain.
·
Sabr Jameel
– beautiful patience.
·
Fitnah
- an Arabic word that does not
translate easily into English.   It means a time of trial or tribulation,
particularly a situation that prevents one from worshipping God correctly, or
causes acts of disobedience or disbelief.
The Quran explains the concept of Allah, it explains in
detail what is permissible and what is forbidden, it explains the basics of good
manners and morals, and gives rulings about worship.   It describes Paradise
and Hell and tells stories about the Prophets and our righteous predecessors.  Stories
in the Quran are usually told in small bite size pieces and revealed over
several
surahs
; the story of Prophet Yusuf however
is told in one
surah
from beginning to end.   Although Prophet Yusuf is
mentioned in several places throughout the Quran, this one
surah
,
surah
12 is his complete story and experience.
The essence of
surah
Yusuf is patience,
sabr
in the face of adversity.
Sabr
means accepting what is beyond our
control, something that ProphetYusuf learned from a very young age.   In
times of stress and anxiety, being able to surrender to the will of God is a
relief beyond measure, Yusuf faced hardships first hand, but he did not accept,
sit back and let life pass him by.  He strove to please Allah in all aspects of
his life.   Renowned Islamic scholar Ibnul Qayyim told us that
sabr
means
having the ability to stop ourselves from despairing, to refrain from
complaining, and to control ourselves in times of sadness and worry.  He also was
able to derive 1000 lessons from
surah
Yusuf.
However in this article we will take a glimpse into the
life of Prophet Yusufand examine just three extremely important lessons.
Lesson 1
Allah alone has control over all affairs.
As a young teenager Prophet Yusuf was cast into a well
by his brothers who were jealous of him, and was later picked up by a caravan
and then sold into slavery.  For a more detailed story about the life of
Prophet Yusuf, please see:
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1790/viewall/
His older brothers were jealous of Yusuf’s bond with
their elderly father so they convinced their father to allow Yusuf to accompany
them for fun and games, but their intention was to kill him. One amongst them
however felt the error of their ways and suggested that rather than killing
Yusuf
,
they should cast him into a well.  When found by some passing traveller he
would be sold into slavery, thus rendering him as good as dead to the family.  They
also believed, in their blindness, that the absence of Yusuf would remove him
from their father’s thoughts.
Allah had other plans, so while the brothers
congratulated themselves, He established Yusuf  in the land of Egypt in order
to teach him wisdom and understanding.  The pain and suffering Yusuf felt being
separated from his father and the frightening ordeal of being sold into slavery
were trials designed to mould Yusuf’s character.  They were Yusuf’s first steps
on the ladder to greatness and they established him as a Prophet of Allah.  The
plots and plans of the treacherous brothers were inconsequential.
Lesson 2
True
sabr
is a key to the gates of Paradise.
When Yusuf’s brothers returned to their father and told
him Yusuf had been taken by a wolf, Yaqub’sheart constricted in pain
and fear.  He knew his sons were lying but he had no option except to face that
fear with complete submission to Allah.   He turned to Allah with hope and
patience.  This type of
sabr
is what Islam calls
sabr jameel -
beautiful
sabr
.
“Nay, but your own selves have made up a tale.   So (for me)
patience is most fitting.   And it is God (Alone) Whose help can be sought
against that which you assert.” (Quran 12:18)
Throughout the many years until Yaqub saw his dear son Yusuf
again, he never gave up hope.  At one time when his sons asked if he would
weep
forever
he replied that he only complained of his grief and sadness to Allah,
and that he knew, due to his total reliance on Allah, things that they did not
know.
Lesson 3
Complete trust in Allah must be practiced consistently, in
all situations, good, bad, easy, or difficult.
If we accept that we are no more than slaves of Allah,
put on this earth, to be tried, tested and tempted, life can take on a
completely new meaning.   Both Yusuf and his father Yaqub recognized that God
was the one thing in their lives they could totally rely on.
During his time in the house of one of the top Ministers
of Egypt Yusuf was forced to fend of the sexual advances of his
benefactor/master’s wife.  Yusuf called out to Allah for help.  He said,
“O my Lord"

Prophets of Allah are filled with lessons.  Some lessons are as applicable
today as they were in the era in which they were experienced.  The Prophets
came with lessons to be learned and understood, messages, and laws.  Sometimes
the laws changed to accommodate a particular time and place but the main
message that they conveyed was the same.  They instructed their peoples to
worship God alone, and not associate anything or anyone in worship with Him.  The
stories of the lives of the prophets emphasize this basic doctrine of Islam
that God is One.
The story of Prophet Ayub is a little different from the
others that we know.  Through his story, we are able to view humankind’s
struggle on a more personal level.  Allah does not tell us about Job’s methods
of preaching or how his people reacted to his warnings and admonitions.   God
does not tell us about the fate of Ayub’s people.   Instead, He tells us about Ayub’s
sabr
.   He (the Almighty) praises Job by saying,
“Truly!  We found
him patient.   How excellent a slave!  Verily, he was ever oft returning in
repentance to Us!” (Quran 38:44)
Lesson 1
To have
sabr
At this point you are probably thinking that all the
Prophets we have discussed so far in this series of lessons have demonstrated
sabr
and of course you would be correct.   It is one of the most important lessons
to learn and to practice.  However Allah, the Most-Wise uses Prophet Ayub’s story
to touch on some areas that otherwise might be overlooked in the study of the
Prophets of Allah and their patience.  Ayub’s story is one of
sabr
, no
doubt about that, however not patience for minutes, hours, or even days.  Prophet
Ayub was patient for years, literally, with not even the smallest break.  The
scholars differ about just how many years but it seems that seven is the
minimum number of years.  Prophet Ayub bore all difficulties with patience.  To
learn more about Prophet Ayub’s suffering and unwavering patience, please see:
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2721/
Lesson 2
Is our sincerity and worship of Allah dependent upon His
blessings on us?
Happiness and afflictions are both tests from Allah.  We
face trials and we experience triumphs.  If we remember Allah in our times of triumph,
will we still worship with sincerity when we are faced with loss or suffering. 
This is just what
Shaytan
intends to find out when he suggests that
Allah removes Ayub’s blessings of wealth, health and family.   Job was
committed to daily prayer and would frequently thank Allah for blessings He had
bestowed on him but
Shaytan
was convinced that Ayubwould turn
away from his Lord when he was faced with intense suffering, illness and
distress.  Allah knew his faithful slave would never turn away from his faith
so He allowed
Shaytan
to afflict Ayub with many calamities one after the
other.
Allah makes it very clear that children and wealth are
merely adornments of this brief life and that He will test us through our love
for them.
Wealth and children are the attractions of this worldly life,
but lasting good works have a better reward with your Lord and give better
grounds for hope.  (Quran 18:46)
He can take the adornments of life away from us as
easily as He can provide them for us, thus we should never rely on this worldly
life, or feel secure.  In the story of Ayub, Allah teaches us that worldly
treasures are ultimately worthless; so never allow the adornments of this
material life to take over your heart nor lose sight of what is important. Do
not give preference to the material realm and put aside your worship and
reverence to your Creator.
Lesson 3
Nothing happens without the Will of Allah.
Allah used the life of Prophet Ayub to teach
Shaytan
a lesson.   It is a lesson that we too can take benefit from.  The lesson is
that Allah is the controller of all affairs.  Human beings,
Jinn
or
Shaytan
can plot, or simply make plans, but none of them will come to fruition
without the permission of Allah.  When you read a more complete story of
Prophet Ayub you will notice that
Shaytan
knew this and sought
permission to test Prophet Ayub.
Prophet Ayub understood that whatever calamities befell
him, they were happening with the permission of Allah.  He also had complete
trust in the Mercy of Allah knowing that if he loved and trusted Allah even
more in the t"

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Musa and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply
to our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Musa
- the Arabic word for Moses.
·
Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a direct
connection between the believer and Allah.  More specifically, in Islam it
refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
On a dark night in the
shadow of Mt. Tur, Allah conferred Prophethood on Musa and engaged him in a
short but remarkable conversation.  It was a conversation that taught Musa
lessons about himself, about his world, about the nature of humankind and about
the nature of Allah.  To this day it continues to teach important lessons to
humankind.  On a daily basis, the words of the Quran change lives.  The lessons
learned in the story of Musa are as relevant today as they were thousands of
years ago.
The story of Musa teaches us the importance of trusting Allah;
it demonstrates that Allah’s plans will overcome any triumph, test, or trial,
and it shows us that there is no relief from the torments of this world except with
remembrance and through seeking nearness to Allah.  Reading and studying the
life of Musa reveals that Allah can replace weakness with strength and failure
with victory; and that Allah supports the righteous from sources we can barely
imagine.
Egypt in the lifetime of Musa was the known world’s
superpower.  Wealth and power were in the hands of very few, and the lives and
lifestyles of the majority were of very little consequence.  The political
situation was in some ways similar to the political world of the 21st century. 
In a time when the young people of the world are used as cannon fodder for the
political and military games of the most powerful, the story of Musa is
particularly pertinent.  It teaches us how to obey the commands of Allah and it
teaches us how to survive in a world where religion is less important than
power and acquisition.
To read more detailed information about the life of
Prophet Musa go to:
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/3366/viewall/
Lesson 1
Establish the
salah.
Musa had extraordinary strength of character, even as a
relatively young man he had developed the ability to persevere even in the direst
circumstances.  He had fled Egypt under the threat of death, trudged across the
desert and found a new life in a new land but later circumstances pulled him
back to the land of his birth.  In the dark of the night, in the shadow of a
mountain the light of a fire drew Musa into an amazing dialogue.  Imagine his
shock and surprise when he found himself engaged in a conversation with Allah,
the Al-Mighty.  After commanding that Musa removes his shoes, Allah reminded
him of humankind’s obligation to Him.
“Verily!  I am Allah!  none has the right to be worshipped but
I, so worship Me, and establish prayer (
salah
) for My Remembrance.  (Quran
20: 14)
In this conversation
salah
was prescribed upon Musa
and his followers.
Salah
was also prescribed upon Prophet Muhammad and
his followers in much the same way.  Allah establishes a direct connection
between Himself and Musa before He revealed Musa’s mission to the court of the
pharaoh of Egypt.  Before Allah commands Musa to face his biggest fear He says,
worship Me and remember Me, because I am able to replace weakness with strength
and failure with victory; I will support you from sources unimaginable.
Salah
forges a connection between Allah and the person who prays and it means that
one is never far from the protection of Allah.  In this day and age when our
fears about the future tend to overwhelm us, an unbreakable bond is a thing of
comfort and joy.
Lesson 2
Allah hears our prayer and supplication.
Musawas a man of honour.  Even after walking
across the Egyptian desert exhausted and dehydrated he was able to put the
needs of others before his own.  Instead of sinking down in the shade of a tree
at a desert oasis he helped two young women who were trying to water their
flock of sheep.  However, when his task was finished he sat down heavily and
appealed to Allah for help.  He said, “O Lord, whatever good you can bestow on
me, I am surely in need of it”.  Before his supplication was finished, the help
from Allah was on its way.   Musa was probably hoping for a slice of bread or a
handful of dates but instead Allah gave him safety, provisions and a family.  A
person must never despair of Allah hearing his prayer and supplication.   We
are never alone, just as Musawas not alone when he fled from his land leaving
behind everything.
Lesson 3
If a person accepts that there is no true god but Allah no
sin is unforgiveable.
One part of the story of Musa that has intrigued people
for centuries is the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of the Egyptians. 
When Pharaoh had power, wealth, good health and strength he refused to
acknowledge Allah.  He denied the signs and ridiculed, belittled and threatened

·Sunnah - The word Sunnah has several
meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally
accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.
Prophet Abraham, known as Ibrahim in Arabic, was born
around 2,000 years before Jesus close to Ur, 200 miles from Baghdad.  The young
Ibrahim questioned the religion surrounding him.
Like those around him, his father Azar was an idol
worshipper, possibly even a sculptor of them; hence Abraham’s first call was
directed to him.  Born with a child’s uncorrupted belief that the world has a
Lord, Ibrahim was instinctively aware of the truth about Him.
“And mention in the Book (the Quran) Abraham, indeed he was a
man of truth, a Prophet.”
Ibrahim began questioning his father’s idol-worship,
“When he said to his father: O my father!  Why do you worship
that which neither hears, not nor sees, nor can avail you in anything?  O my
father!  Lo!  There has come to me of knowledge that which came not to you.  So
follow me, and I will lead you on a right path.  O my father!  Worship not
Satan.  Lo!  Satan is a rebel to the Beneficent.  O my father!  Lo!  I fear
lest a punishment from the Beneficent should overtake you so that you become a
comrade of Satan.”
[1]
“Do you take idols as gods?” (Quran 6:74)
The reply from his father was natural rejection of a
challenge by another not only much younger than him, but also his offspring, a
challenge made against years of tradition and norm.
He (the father) said:
“Do you reject my gods, O Abraham?  If you do not stop, I will indeed stone
you.  So get away from me safely before I punish you.” (Quran 19:46)
Ibrahim stayed firm in his stance on misdirected worship
of his father and those that surrounded him.  In his rejection of idolatry Ibrahim
began his spiritual journey to the Lord of the Worlds.  Contemplating on the
universe shifted his attention from the creation to the Creator, and with it
came the opportunity to further his call that the only deity which deserved
worship was God, Almighty.  The Quran tells us:
“When the night grew dark upon him, he beheld a star, and
said, ‘This is my Lord!’  But when it set, he said: ‘I love not things that
set.’” (Quran 6:76)
Ibrahim had presented the example of the stars to them, so
incomprehensible to them as to be seen as something greater than man with
attributes of various powers he has not.  But in the setting of the stars Ibrahim
saw their inability to appear as they desired, but rather only at night.
Another example of something even greater is a heavenly
body more beautiful, and larger, visible in daytime as well!  However, the
horizon cut off its majesty:
“And when he saw the moon rising up, he exclaimed: ‘This is my
Lord.’  But when it set, he said: ‘Unless my Lord guides me, I surely shall
become one of the folk who are astray.’” (Quran 6:77)
Then as his culminating example, he brought forth to
contemplate something even bigger, one of the most powerful objects of
creation, without which life itself was an impossibility.
And when he saw the sun rising, he cried: “This is my Lord!  This
is greater!”  But when the sun set, he said, “O my people!  Surely I am free
from that which you associate with God. Verily, I have turned my face towards
Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, away from idolatry, and I am not
of those who associate others with God.” (Quran 6:78)
Thus Ibrahim proved to his satisfaction and the
consternation of his peers that the Lord of the worlds was not to be found in
the creations that their idols represented, but was, rather, the entity who
created them and everything which they could see and perceive; that the Lord
does not necessarily need to be seen in order to be worshipped.  He is an
All-Able Lord, not bound by limitations as the creations found in this world are.
“And We verily gave Ibrahim of old his proper course.”
[2]
However, despite these proofs his people still argued
with him.
[3]
They
said:
“Nay, but we found our wise fathers acting in this way.”
[4]
He denied that one’s ancestors are necessarily right, or
that we should slavishly follow their customs, by saying:
“Verily you and your fathers were in plain error.”
His message was simple:
“Worship God, and keep your duty to Him; that is better for
you if you did but know.  You worship instead of God only idols, and you only
invent a lie.  Lo!  Those whom you worship instead of God own no provision for
you.  So seek your provision from God, and worship Him, and give thanks to Him,
(for) to Him you will be brought back.”
[5]
Then the time came when preaching had to be accompanied
with physical action.  Ibrahim planned a bold and decisive blow at idolatry, a
plan which had hinted involved their idols,
“And, by God, I shall circumvent your idols after you have
gone away and turned your backs.” (Quran 21:57)

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Jesus (Isa).
·To understand that Jesus never called
himself God.
·To understand that converting to Islam does
not mean giving up belief in Jesus.
Arabic Terms:
·
Isa
– The Arabic name for Jesus.  A
full explanation can be found here
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1447/
·
Sunnah
- The word Sunnah generally means
whatever was reported of what the Prophet said, did, or approved of.
·
Al-Fatihah
– The opening chapter of
the Quran.
·
Injeel
– the Arabic word meaning Gospel,
in this case referring to the gospels of Jesus, before they were adulterated or
altered over time.

In Islam,
Isa
is a loved and
esteemed man, a Prophet and Messenger calling his people to the worship of the
One True God.  Muslims and Christians share some very similar beliefs about Isa.
 A full description can be found in this article,
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1412/
and in other articles on the  same website.  However
Muslims and Christians are worlds apart in one major detail.   Muslims do not
believe that Isais God, or that he is the son of God, or that he is
part of a Trinity.
Lesson 1
Muslims love Isa too
The status of Prophet Isa in Islam
sometimes becomes problematic for many Christians converting to Islam.  Often
it is difficult for them to reconcile old spiritual beliefs for their newly
adopted ones.  The first important lesson that we can learn by glimpsing into
the life of Prophet Isais that he remains a very important person.  One
who loves Prophet Isa can embrace Islam without having to stop loving him.  In
Islam, loving all prophets and messengers is a key Tenet of Faith.
Prophet Isa is
such an influential figure among both Muslims and Christians that it is
possible for Muslims and Christians across the globe to build bridges of understanding,
tolerance, and shared values through their love for this prophet.
Lesson 2
Isa never referred
to himself as God
In both the Christian Gospels, what
Muslims refer to as the
Injeel
, and in the sources of Islam, Isa never
called himself God (Allah) or taught that he was anything other than a Prophet or
Messenger from Allah to the people of Israel.
Isa
taught his followers to
pray to God only, not to himself.  Nor did he indicate that anyone should pray
in his name.
The first of the ten commandments
revealed to Prophet Moses (Musa) was Deuteronomy:4, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord
our God is one Lord”.  This was reiterated and endorsed by Isa in the Gospel of
Mark (12:28 & 29).  “And one of the scribes came, and … asked him, which is
the first commandment of all? And Isa answered him, ‘The first of all the
commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.’“
In the Quran, Prophet Isa says,
“… ‘I
have come to you with wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the
(points) on which you dispute.  Therefore, fear Allah and obey me. Indeed,
Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.  This is a straight path.’”
(Quran 43:63)
In the words from the King James Bible,
when one of Isa’s disciples asked him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught
his disciples.” He replied, “When you pray, say: ‘Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is
in heaven.  Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us the wrong we have
done as we forgive those who wrong us.  Subject us not to the trial but deliver
us from the evil one.’“ (Luke 11:1-4, Matthew 6:9-13)
Isa was
teaching his followers what Christianity refers to as “The Lord’s Prayer”, a
prayer that Christians esteem in much the same way as Muslims think of the
opening chapter of Quran,
Al-Fatihah
.
Lesson 3
A brotherly bond exists between Prophets Isa
and Muhammad
Like Isa son of Mary, the Prophet
Muhammad came to confirm the message of all the Prophets before him; he called
the people to worship the One God.  In his
Sunnah
Prophet Muhammad
refers to the relationship that exists between all of the prophets of Allah as
a brotherhood. But when he spoke about Prophet Isa, he said:
“I am nearest
to the son of Mary in this world and the Hereafter.  There is no prophet
between him and me.
“
[1]
He also said,
“Whoever testifies
that there in none worthy of being worshipped but God, Who has no partner, and
that Muhammad is His slave and Prophet, and that Jesus is the Slave of God, His
Prophet, and His word
[2]
which
He bestowed in Mary and a spirit created from Him; and that Paradise (Heaven)
is true, and that the Hellfire is true, God will eventually admit him into
Paradise, according to his deeds.”
[3]
God says in the Quran:
“Jesus, Son
of Mary, is only a Messenger of Allah, and a fulfilment of His command, 'Be',
which He conveyed to Mary, and he is a soul from Him, like the souls of the
rest of humans.”
[4]

inequalities and injustices in their respec"

After years of unsuccessful preaching and anguish at the
probable fate of his father in the Hereafter, tenderhearted Ibrahim kept his
promise to pray for his father.  It was a promise Allah rejected in the end (Quran
9:113-114).  When Ibrahim left behind Harran and the idolaters, he provided and
example for us.  Allah recommends part and warns against part of what he announced:
“Indeed there is for you a good example in Ibrahim and those
with him, when they said to their people: ‘We are clear of you and of that
which you serve besides Allah.  We disbelieve in you and there has arisen
enmity and hatred between us and you forever until you believe in Allah alone’
- except for the saying of Ibrahim to his father, ‘I will surely ask forgiveness
for you, but I have not (power to do) for you anything against Allah.’”
[1]
Ibrahim migrated to Egypt, where he met the Pharaoh.  Sarah,
a beautiful and and charming woman, attracted the attention of the Pharaoh.  When
asked about his relationship with Sarah, Ibrahim replied that she was his
sister - he meant his sister in faith.  Through her, a statement was about to
be made to the Egyptians to submit to Allah.  Thinking she was available for
his use, the Pharaoh quickly summoned Sarah who, on Ibrahim’s instructions,
kept quiet about her relationship with him.  Sarah, however, was a chaste
woman, and she turned to Allah in prayer.  The moment Pharaoh reached for
Sarah, his upper body paralyzed.  He cried to Sarah in distress, promising to
release her if she would release him!  She, however, simply prayed to Allah for
his release, to demonstrate that only He has the power, if He wills, to protect
her.  Only after a failed third attempt did he finally let her go.  Sarah
returned to Ibrahim, accompanied by Hagar, a gift from Pharaoh to propitiate one
so protected by Allah.  She had delivered a powerful message to the pagan
Egyptians, yet still the Pharaoh misdirected his propitiation, which should
have been directed towards Allah.
Loaded with gifts, Ibrahim returned to Palestine.  Yet Sarah
and Ibrahim continued to be childless, despite divine promises that he will
have many descendants.  Driven by altruism, Sarah suggested that Ibrahim take
Hagar, her handmaiden, as a second wife to bear him a child on her behalf.  While
in Palestine, Ibrahim married Hagar who bore him a son, Ishmael.
While Ishmael was still nursing, Ibrahim was commanded
by Allah to take Hagar and Ishmael to a barren valley of Bakka 700 miles
southeast of Hebron.  In later times it would be called Mecca.  Ibrahim left
them there with a skin of water and leather bag full of dates.  As Ibrahim
began walking away leaving them behind, Hagar became anxious about what was
happening.  Ibrahim did not look back.  Hagar chased him,
‘O Ibrahim, where
are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company
we can enjoy, nor is there anything here?’
Ibrahim hurried his pace.  Finally,
Hagar asked,
‘Has Allah asked you to do so?’  Suddenly, Ibrahim stopped,
turned back and said, ‘Yes!’
Feeling a degree of comfort in this answer,
Hagar asked,
‘O Ibrahim, to whom are you leaving us?’  ‘I am leaving you to
Allah’s care,’
Ibrahim replied.  Hagar submitted to her Lord,
‘I am
satisfied to be with Allah!’
[2]
She
traced her way back to little Ishmael.  Ibrahim left with prayers for his wife
and child, which he prayed when he was out of sight.
Soon, the water and dates were gone and Hagar’s
desperation increased.  Unable to quench her thirst or to breastfeed her little
baby, Hagar began searching for water.  She began climbing the rocky incline of
a nearby hill.  ‘Maybe there is a caravan passing by,’ she thought to herself. 
She ran between the two hills of Safa and Marwa seven times looking for signs
of water, and then she heard a voice.  Looking down in the valley, she saw someone
standing next to Ishmael.  It was the angel Gabriel,  who hit the ground next
to the baby with his heel as she came rushing down the hill, and water came
gushing out.  It was a miracle!  Hagar tried to make a basin around it to keep
to from flowing out and filled her skin.
‘Do not be afraid of being
neglected,’ the angel said, ‘for t"

While the majority of Muslims share the same fundamental
beliefs, with 1.62 billion adherents –close to a quarter of planet Earth’s
population
[1]
– distributed over the far stretches of the continents and among 49 countries
where Muslims are a majority and a history of more than a thousand years, all people
who call themselves Muslims are not exactly the same.  There are sometimes
significant religious differences between them.  In the following two lessons, we
will cover the following points in more detail:
Do the existence of sects mean that Islamic teachings
(contained in Quran and
Sunnah
) mandate them? The answer is no.  What is
important is to realize that unlike other religions, Allah has taken upon
Himself to protect Islam - the last revelation and the most complete religion
of God to humanity.  You will not find any promise from God in the Bible or
almost any other religious text that He will protect it.  On the other hand,
you do find two important promises from God in the Quran:
“God has completed His religion of Islam” (Quran 5:3)
God will protect and safeguard His religion form change (Quran
15:9)
The existence of sects is due to reasons whose
discussion is beyond this lesson.
All Sects are Not Equal: An Analogy of Circles
An analogy can better explain the issue of sects.  The
Quran and
Sunnah
sit at the center around which there are many circles. 
Some Muslims will lie within a circle, but others will lie outside of it.  In
other words, some Muslims will be closer to the center, others may be distant. 
Then, think of a red circle which is so far from the center that anyone who
lies outside of that red circle is not even considered a Muslim.  The radius of
the circle is a measure of how “deviant” the sect is.
In other words, the most “deviant” sects, one can call
them cults, will be outside of the red circle.  They will be the ones that have
the most serious conflict with the established Islamic beliefs and practices.  Examples
would be Ahmadis, Bahais, and the Druze.
Sects Are Confusing, Who Do I Follow?
What becomes confusing is that with the existence of
different sects, who does a new Muslim follow, especially when most sects claim
to follow the Quran and
Sunnah
.  What is a new Muslim to do? How does he
or she determine who is right and who is wrong? In simple words, how does a new
Muslim avoid confusion? Let us break down the answer to this question in a few
points:
First
, if we go back to the Quran and
Sunnah
,
we will find the answer to this question.  You see, the Quran and
Sunnah
are texts; some will try to take the Quran alone, separating it from the
Sunnah
(Prophetic traditions). They would then interpret the Quran they way they like.
The only way to properly understand the Quran is by going back to the Prophetic
traditions and to understand both in light of the understanding of the people
who were present at the time of revelation.  These texts were revealed in their
time, many of the texts were addressed to them
[2]
,
and they had the best teacher (the Prophet of Allah) to explain to them anything
that needed explanation.  Let us see what the Prophet said regarding this
matter,
“The best of people is my generation, then those who
come after them, then those who come after them.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh
Muslim)
The Prophet distinguished the first three generation of
Muslims to be the “best.” If they are the “best” according to the Prophet of
Islam, then it makes sense that we understand and practice Islam the way the
“best” people understood and practiced Islam.
Second
, it is important to know that the first
generation of Islam is known as the generation of the “
Sahabah
.” The
word “
sahabah
” means “companions” in Arabic.  Its singular is “
sahabi
,”
which means a “companion.” The second and third generation also have names, but
“
sahabah
” is the most important term to know for now.
Third
, it is important that one not judge for
himself who is Muslim and who is not. When one lacks the proper knowledge,
issues such as this should be left to the scholars. There are some sects that
do have good and bad incorporated into their beliefs. Take Sufis
[3]
as an example.

Signs of Deviant Sects
While there is no easy way to tell who belongs
to what sect, the following are some guidelines that warrant caution:
1.Disregard for proofs and evidences based on the Quran and
Sunnah.
2.Speaking badly about the
sahabah
(companions) of the
Prophet.
3.Following personal desires and putting them ahead of the Quran
and
Sunnah
.
4.Not paying attention to Islamic Monotheism and hating those who
do.
5.Creating division among the Muslims.
6.Rejecting the teachings (
Sunnah
) of the Prophet Muhammad,
claiming the Quran is sufficient.
7.Putting another person (usually the leader of the sect) at the
same level of Prophet Muhammad in terms of love, respect, and obedience.
8.Hating the scholars of Islam.
Examples of Sects Influential in the West
As mentioned earlier, not all sects are equal. Even
within a sect, there are sub sects that vary greatly in their teachings.
Keeping this in mind, below is a brief discussion of some sects:
1.Ahmadis
[1]
Ahmadis or Qadiyanis are a missionary-oriented sect of Indian
origin, founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1839-1908). The Qadiyanis currently have
a presence in many countries, including most Western countries. Their world
wide numbers are estimated as high as 10 million. Even though their
headquarters are in Pakistan, they have a strong presence in London, UK.
2.Ismailis
Also known as “Sevener Shi'ites.” The Ismailis reject
the Quran and all forms of prayers found in the main Sunni Islamic tradition.
This frees them from obligations such as prayer, fasting, and hajj. They are
mostly located in Pakistan, North-west India and the Chinese province of
Sin-Kiang. The Khojas, a sub-sect, are mainly to be found in Gujarat, India.
There are also Khoja communities in East and South Africa. They are also found
in the Western countries. Most Ismaili businesses put the picture of Prince
Karim Agha Khan, their leader, at a prominent place in their shop.
3.Bahais
[2]
Bahais follow the teaching of Bahaullah ('splendor of
God') (1817-1892). They attract followers by speaking of unity of humanity and
the absolute equality of men and women. Bahais see themselves working towards
the establishment of a world government which will eradicate extremes of wealth
and poverty. The writings of Bahaullah are treated as sacred. It is estimated
that there are between 3 to 4 million Bahais in the world today, spread in most
countries of the world with the largest concentration in India. In Iran the
Bahais remain the largest minority group with about 300,000 adherents. The
international Baha'i center is in Israel.
4.Shias
[3]
Also spelled “Shi’ites.” The “Twelver Shias” believe
that, after the death of the Prophet, the Imamate (the political and religious
leadership of the Muslim community) should have gone to 'Ali - the cousin and
son-in-law of the Prophet - and his descendants as a divine right.
Unlike
the Sunnis, who perform prayers five times a day, the Shi'ites pray three times
a day. The Twelver Shias population in 1980 was estimated to be 73,000,000.
They are dominant in Iran, but are also found in Pakistan, India, Iraq,
Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Syria. There are also small Shia communities
in the West, one of the largest in Dearborn, Michigan.
5.Nation of Islam
[4]
The Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace Muhammad in
Detroit in 1930. The group believes that a person called Fard Muhammad was “God
on earth.” It sees Elijah Muhammad as the ""Messenger of Truth.""
Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad, brought the group closer to
mainstream Sunni Islam. Some dissatisfied members were led by Louis Farrakhan,
who revived the group in 1978 with the same teachings of Elijah. They only
allow people of black ethnicity in and believe they are the original race on
earth. They are especially popular in the prison system in the US.
6.Submitters
Founded by Dr. Rashad Khalifa, an Egyptian computer
scientist. Submitters consider Rashad Khalifa to be a Messenger of God. They
reject two verses of the Quran, preach the “miracle of 19,” and reject the
hadith

Bidah
is an Arabic word that comes from the root
Al-Bada’
meaning to create something without precedence.  In English we would use the
word “innovation”. Before discussing
bidah
in any depth we must
distinguish between two types of
bidah
. The first type is innovation in
the matter of things pertaining to our worldly life. Things like technology,
electricity and transport would come under this category. These things are
permissible and in many cases could even be called desirable. The second type
of innovation pertains to matters of the
deen
. In matters of religion
bidah
is not permissible and it can be dangerous to introduce new things in our
religion. Because of the danger there are many quotations and traditions from
the
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad that point this out.
“Whoever innovates into this affair of ours
something that we have not commanded, it is to be rejected”.
[1]
The best speech is the Book of Allah and the best
guidance and example is that of Muhammad, and the worst of all things are the
newly invented things (in the religion), for every religious innovation is an
error and a misguidance.”
[2]
“…Every religious innovation is a means of
misguidance and every means of misguidance is in the fire.”
[3]
The
deen
of Islam has no need for
bidah
. The
religion of Islam is complete and there is no need to introduce or invent new
matters in the religion. This is confirmed by the Quranic statement
“This
day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and
have chosen for you Islam as your
deen
” (Quran 5:3)
When a person innovates something and adds to the
deen
something that does not already belong to it, he implies that the religion is
lacking and in need of improvement, or the implication is that Allah did not
complete and perfect it His religion. This is clearly not the case as we can
see from the above verse.
Why is it important to avoid
bidah
Whilst Allah does not punish a person who falls into
error due to ignorance we are obligated to educate ourselves to the best of our
ability. The reality is that Allah will not accept an action that does not
fulfil two important conditions. The first condition is that the action be done
with a sincere intention to please Allah almighty. The second is that the
action is done according to what is taught in the Quran and the authentic S
unnah
of Prophet Muhammad. The action must conform to the
Sunnah
and not be in
contradiction to it.
With this in mind let us revisit the meaning of
bidah
.
 Linguistically, it means creating or inventing something new, something
without precedence.  Legally, it is to add something new to the
deen
of
Allah. Even if the action is invented as a way of drawing closer to or
worshipping Allah it still does not become acceptable. It is still a sin.
How do we know if an act of worship is really an act of
bidah
?
On many occasions you will hear it said that Islam is a
religion of informed knowledge. This implies that believers do not take things
on face value. A believer takes the time to learn and understand the details of
the
deen
and he learns to question actions or sayings that are not
presented with clear evidence. If he takes the time to learn Islam a person is
able to recognise what is a
Sunnah
action and what is
bidah
.
The following are six ways to distinguish between a
Sunnah
and a
bidah:
1.An act of worship related to a cause or reason that has not been
legislated:
It is not
permissible to link an act of worship to a cause or reason that has not been
legislated in the Quran or the authentic
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad.  An
example of this would be waking up to pray at night during the seventh day of
the Islamic month of
Rajab
with the belief that Prophet Muhammad
ascended to the heavens on this night. The act of praying in the night is
something that is legislated in Islam with sufficient evidence from the Quran
and
Sunnah
, however when it is linked to this reason it becomes a
bidah
because it is based and constructed upon a reason which is not established from
the
Shariah
.
2.Type of worship:
It is also essential that the act of worship agrees with
the
Shariah
in its type. If a person was to worship Allah with an act of
worship whose t"

How do we know if an act of worship is really an act of
bidah
?
3.  Quantity of worship:
Another way to recognize the difference between a
Sunnah
and a
bidah
is based on the quantity of worship. If a person decided to
pray five
rakahs
of prayer for the
Dhuhr
prayer this would be a
bidah
.
We know that this prayer consists of four
rakahs
; this is what is
legislated and to introduce an extra unit of prayer would be considered an
innovation, a
bidah
.
4.Manner of performance of worship:
Another way of distinguishing between something that
originates in the Quran and the
Sunnah
and an innovation is to look at
the manner of performance. That is, how do we perform the act of worship, is it
in accordance with what the
deen
of Islam teaches, or have we overstepped
the boundaries and added something to a religion that has already been
perfected. An example of this is making ablution before prayer in an incorrect
order, such as beginning with washing the feet instead of finishing with this.
5.Time of worship:
The time we perform an act of worship is also important.
If a worship is performed according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and
the specified time, then it does indeed please our Creator. However if a person
takes it upon himself to change the specified time then that person has fallen
into the sin of
bidah
. For example, sacrificing sheep in the month of
Ramadan
with the intention of seeking a reward similar to the reward for sacrificing on
Eid ul-Adha
then this would be considered an innovation.
6.Place of worship:
The place in which the act of worship is performed
should also be in accordance with what has been legislated. If, for example a
person was to make
itikaf
in his home this would not be acceptable. The
place for
itikaf
is the mosque, thus performing it in any other place
would be considered a
bidah
.
A list of common innovations
·Seeking help from the occupants of the grave.
This
bidah
is of particular importance because it also encompasses
shirk
,
the greatest sin in Islam.
·Sitting in groups and saying words of
remembrance of Allah, such as Allahu Akbar, in unison.
·Taking the birthday of the Prophet as an
Eid
.
·Fasting on the fifteenth of the Islamic
month of
Shaban
and spending that night in prayer.
·Celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.
·Reciting Quran to benefit the deceased (this
includes hiring people to recite Quran).
·Wiping over the back of the neck when making
ablution.
·The family of the deceased preparing food
for others who visit.
What is a “good
bidah
”?
On occasions you might hear  of something called a ‘good
bidah
’. According to Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him,
“… there is no such thing in Islam (in the religious sense) as a good
bidah
.”
[1]
The sheikh also emphasised that “…with regard
to ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called
bidah
(innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic
terms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not
the things that the Prophet was warning us against”. In addition to this noted
Islamic scholar Imam Ibn Rajab
[2]
said, “Any words from our righteous predecessors considering something as a good
bidah
were meant in a linguistic sense and not the Islamic sense”.
In conclusion
bidah
is a newly invented belief or
action in the
deen
of Islam by which closeness to Allah is sought but it
is not supported by any authentic proof "

Introduction
Linguistically, theterm
Adhan
means “a
proclamation”, and this is what is meant in the verse of the Quran:
“And a
proclamation
(adhan) from Allah and His
messenger to all people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free
from (all) obligations to the polytheists, and so is His messenger.” (Quran
9:3)
In religious context, the
adhan
is that proclamation
made, consisting of specific “words of remembrance”, the time for an obligatory
salah
has begun. Throughout the Muslim world and in some places in the
West, the caller to prayer announces five times a day from every mosque that it
is time for prayer, to remember Allah, and to put aside all the cares of life
to prepare for the worship of the Giver of Life.  The prayer “God is the
Greatest” resonates through all semblances of civilization, through small towns
to metropolises.
The
adhan
covers all the essentials of the Islamic
faith in a few words:
1.    It begins by proclaiming the greatness of
Allah.
2.    It testifies to Allah’s
tawheed
and
His exclusive right to worship.
3.    It denies
shirk
– the worship of
everything besides Allah.
4.    The
adhan
testifies that Muhammad, may
the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, is the Messenger of Allah.
5.    It mentions belief in one of the greatest
pillars of Islam: the
salah
(ritual prayer).
6.    Invites to the prayer and equates it with
prosperity, salvation and success (in the hereafter)
7.    It affirms the reward for
salah
:
prosperity for one who singles out Allah in
tawheed
, follows His
Messenger, establishes the
salah
and other pillars of Islam.
8.    It implies the loss of one who does not
respond to the
adhan
and does not pray.
History of
Adhan
The
adhan
was prescribed during the first year after
the Prophet migration to Medina.  It was taught in true visions to two
companions and made part of Muslim life by the Prophet himself.  Abdullah ibn
Zaid, a companion of the Prophet, reported:
“When the Prophet was
to order the use of a bell to call the people to prayer, he disliked it because
it resembled the Christian practice.  While I was sleeping, a man came to me carrying
a bell.  I said to him, ‘O slave of Allah, will you sell me that bell?’
He said, ‘What would
you do with it?’
I replied, ‘I would
call the people to prayer with it.’
He responded, ‘Shall I
not guide you to something better than that?’
I said, ‘Certainly.’
He said, ‘You should
say:
Allahu akbar, Allahu
akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar
Ashhadu alla ilaha illal-lah,
ashhadu alla ilaha illal-lah
Ashhadu anna
Muhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah,
ashhadu anna
Muhammadar-Rasool-lal-lah
Hayya ‘alas-salah,
hayyah ‘alas-salah
Hayya ‘alal-falah,
hayya ‘alal-falah
Allahu akbar, Allahu
akbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’
Then he went a short
distance away and said, ‘When you stand for the prayer, say:
Allahu
akbar,
Allahu akbar
Ashhadu alla ilaha
illal-lah
Ashhadu anna
Muhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah
Hayya ‘alas-salah,
hayya ‘alal-falah
Qad qaamatis-salah,
qad qaamatis-salah
Allahu akbar, Allahu
akbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’
When the morning came, I went to the Messenger of
Allah to tell him what I had seen.  He said, ‘Your dream is true, Allah willing. 
Go to Bilal, tell him what you have seen, and tell him to make the call to
prayer, for he has the best voice among you.’ I went to Bilal and told him what
to do, and he made the call to prayer.  ‘Umar was in his house when he heard it. 
He came out with his cloak, saying ‘By the One who has raised you with the
truth, I saw similar to what he saw.’ The Prophet said, ‘All praise is to
Allah.’”
[1]

The
masjid
, translated as
mosque in English, is the heartbeat of the Muslim society in Islam. In the
West, most often Muslims buy land and build a
masjid
on it. Other times,
they buy a church or some other building and convert it into a
masjid
.
Sometimes, they even rent a room, garage, or a basement and use it as makeshift
masjid
.
In all cases, a
masjid
is a place for Muslims where
they meet one another daily to perform the prayers and also to conduct other
acts of worship and activities that are beneficial for the Muslim community.
The most important act of worship done in the
masjid
is the Friday prayer. Five daily prayers are also offered in most of them. Many
masjids
will have a dedicated
imam
, a prayer leader, who will
lead the daily prayers. Some of them do not have a dedicated
imam
, but one
of the attendees will lead the prayer when the prayer time comes. Similarly,
the regular
imam
might also deliver the Friday sermon and lead the
prayers or there might be different speakers who rotate weekly and deliver the
Friday sermon.
Prophet Muhammad taught us that the
masjids
are houses
of Allah and that certain etiquettes and rules should be learned and observed
by every Muslim who attends them.
Following are some of the etiquettes and manners of a
masjid
:
1.    Worship is the first priority. The primary purpose
of going to the
masjid
is to worship the One true Lord of the heavens
and the earth. Everything else is secondary. Many mosques provide gaming and
social events like basketball, community dinners, picnics, etc. They are all
worthwhile, but serve a secondary purpose. The
masjid
is primarily a
place for the worship of Allah and that typically means prayer and reading or
reciting the Quran.
2.    The general rule is that a Muslim should be
clean, wear clean clothes, and not smell bad when he or she comes to the mosque.
He should avoid everything that has an offensive smell like that caused by eating
raw garlic, raw onions, or smoking.
A Muslim should also wear clean clothes and socks when
he comes to the
masjid
. Not only do bad smells bother fellow human
beings, but they also offend the angels who are present. Remember, that a
masjid
is the house of Allah after all.
If a person performs work that makes him sweat or other
bodily odors, then he should take a shower and change clothes before coming to
the
masjid
. It is reported that the Prophet Muhammad said:
""Whoever eats garlic or onion, then he must
keep away from our
masjid
because the angels get offended from what
offends the children of Adam."" (Saheeh Muslim)
3.    A Muslim should enter the
masjid
with
his right foot first, and then say what was reported from Prophet Muhammad:
“
Allah-hum-maf-tah lee abwaaba
rahmatik
.”
“O Allah, open the gates of your Mercy
for me.”
This supplications is optional, however saying it is a
rewarding act.
The Prophet liked to start with his right side in everything.
The famous companion of Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Umar, in imitation of the Prophet
used to step with his right foot first when he entered the
masjid
, and
step out with his left foot first when he walked out of the
masjid.
(
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
).
4.    In order to keep the carpet clean, where people
put their faces, it is appropriate to remove one's shoes before entering the
prayer hall. This goes for children as well, who may drag dirt all over the
carpet - not to mention that they shouldn't be running around inside the prayer
hall.
Many mosques have a rack for shoes that should be
utilized to keep the space clear of shoes in walkways and other spaces. It also
makes it easier to find shoes later on.
5.    A Muslim should greet people by saying “
As-Salamu
Alaikum
” to the people in the
masjid
as he enters it, even if he
sees the people are praying. He does not have to shout it out. Saying it in an
audible voice is enough. The Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say “
As-Salamu
Alaikum
” to the Prophet while he was praying, and he used to reply with a gesture.
There are many reports about that. For example, Suhaib, a Companion of the
Prophet, said: ""I passed by the Messenger of Allah while he was praying
and gave
Salam
to him, (and) he replied to me with a gesture."" (Nasai)
In another instance, Ibn Umar asked Bilal, another
Companion of Prophet Muhammad, ‘How did you see the Prophet reply to the Companions
when they said
Salam
to him while he was engaged in prayer?"" Bilal
said: ""By spreading his palm."" (
Tirmidhi
)

Basics of the voluntary prayers known as
nafl
will be taught in this lesson.
Objectives
·To appreciate the difference between
nafl
and
fard
worship.
·To appreciate the benefits of
nafl
worship.
·To learn about the commonly prayed voluntary
prayers.
Arabic Terms
·
Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha
– the
names of five daily prayers in Islam.
·
Fard
– an obligatory duty.
·
Nafl
– a voluntary act of worship.
·
As-Sunan ar-Rawatib
– the extra
prayers done by the Prophet before and after the daily obligatory prayers.
·
Rakah
- unit of prayer.
·
Tasleem
– the salutation of peace
that ends the prayer.
·
Duha
– name of an optional prayer
done during the daytime.
The first thing to understand is the difference
between what is known as
fard
and what is known as
nafl
.
Fard
is obligatory, it is what Allah requires us to do, and leaving it is a sin and
we will be held accountable for it.  An example is two
rakah
of
Fajr
prayer.
Nafl
literally means ‘extra’.
Nafl
worship is not
required from a Muslim, rather it is up to the individual to offer it.  It is
optional and voluntary.  The Muslim is not sinful for neglecting
nafl
,
but is rewarded for doing it.  Therefore,
nafl
worship is recommended.  Examples
of
nafl
prayers will be covered in this lesson.
A word of advice about the voluntary prayers.   Add them
slowly to your daily, obligatory prayers.  You must first focus on the five
daily, required prayers and make sure you are praying them regularly and on
time.  Add them step by step, do not burn yourself out, and at the same time do
not neglect the voluntary prayers.
Benefit of
Nafl
Prayers
The Prophet said: “The first thing that the people will
be called to account for on the Day of Resurrection will be the prayers.  Our
Lord will say to the angels although He knows better: ‘Look into the prayer (formal
obligatory prayer) of my servant to see if he observed it perfectly or has been
negligent in it.’ So if he observed it perfectly it will be recorded to his
credit, but if he had been negligent in it in any way, Allah would say: ‘See if
My servant has any extra prayers.’ Then if he has any extra prayers, Allah
would say: ‘Make up the deficiency in My servant’s obligatory prayer with his
supererogatory prayers.’ Thereafter all his actions will be examined in like
manner” (Abu Dawud).
Two Types Of
Nafl
Prayers
a)    General
nafl
prayers:  One can pray
them whenever one likes and there does not have to be any reason or cause for
it, neither are they restricted to any given number.   However it should be
noted that the general
nafl
prayers should not be offered at the time
when performing non obligatory prayers is prohibited or disliked.
b)   Specific
nafl
prayers:  These prayers are
associated with a specific reason or cause.
Examples of Commonly Prayed Specific
Nafl
Prayers
As-Sunan ar-Rawatib
(often simply referred to as  ‘
Sunnah
prayers’)
They are voluntary prayers that are associated with the
obligatory prayers and have a specific order and number.  The ones often prayed
are listed below:

The
Messenger of
Allah said:
“Whoever prays twelve
rakah
during the day and night
will have a house built for him in Paradise: four
rakah
before
Dhuhr
and two after it, two
rakah
after
Maghrib
, two
rakah
after
Isha
, and two
rakah
before
Fajr
.” (
Tirmidhi
)
The Prophet said
about the two
rakah
before the obligatory
Fajr
prayer
, “They
are dearer to me than the whole world.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
“The Prophet never left praying four
rakah
before
Dhuhr
and two
rakah
before
Fajr
under any
circumstances.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Witr
Prayer
The Prophet prayed and encouraged others to pray the
Witr
prayer.  It is a
nafl
and highly emphasized optional prayer, and according
to some scholars it is a required prayer.
It is offered after
Isha
prayer and can be prayed
before the time for
Fajr
prayer starts.
It is permissible to perform the
Witr
by:
1.Praying two
rakah
like any other two
rakah
prayer,
concluding them with
tasleem
and then praying one more
rakah
and ending
the prayer with
tasleem
.
2.Praying three
rakah
continually (
without
sitting
after the second
rakah
as in
Magrib
) and then concluding the
prayer with
tasleem.
3.One
rakah
and ending the prayer with
tasleem
.
Tahiyya-tul-Masjid
(Prayer for Entering the Mosque)
It is a prayer in which two
nafl
rakah
are
performed at the time of entering the mosque.  The Messenger said,
“If
anyone of you enters a mosque, he should pray two
rakah
before sitting.”
(
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Salat at-Tawba
(Prayer of Repentance)
Allah’s Messenger
said,
“There is no man who, upon committing a sin, purifies himself and
performs two
rakah
, then asks for forgiveness from Allah, but Allah
forgives him” (
Abu Daud, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah
)

Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a
direct connection between the believer and Allah. More specifically, in Islam
it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
·
Rukn
- (plural:
arkan
)
essential component; a pillar without which something cannot stand.
·
Qiblah
: The direction one faces
during the formal prayers.
·
Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
·
Hadith
-
(plural –

a narrative record of the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his
companions.

Tashahhud
– the saying “

’
abduhu wa
rasuluh
.” in the sitting position of the prayer.
·
Wudoo
– ablution.
·
Wajib
- (plural:
wajibaat
) obligatory.
The scholars categorize different actions and sayings of
the prayer into essential components (
arkan
), obligatory acts (
wajibaat)
,
and recommendations.
The difference between a
rukn
(essential component) and a
wajib
(obligatory act) is that a
rukn
cannot
be waived, whether one omits it deliberately or by mistake,
rather it must be done. A
wajib
(obligatory act) is waived if one
forgets, and it can be compensated for by doing the “prostration of
forgetfulness” (will be discussed later).
In this lesson we will first learn the
arkan
(essential
components).
Essential Components (
Arkan
)
of
Salah
1. Saying ‘
Allahu Akbar
’ at the beginning
The Prophet said to a person who prayed incorrectly, “then
face the
qiblah
and say
Allahu Akbar.
”
[1]
2. Reciting
Surah
al-Fatihah
The Prophet said,  “There is no prayer for someone who
does not recite the Opening of the Book (
Surah
al-Fatihah).”
[2]
3. Standing during obligatory prayers if one is able to do so
Based on the verse,
“and stand for Allah with
devotion.” (Quran 2:238)
Also, the Prophet said, “Pray standing; if you are not
able to; pray sitting, if you are not able to; pray (while lying) on your side.”
[3]
4. Bowing
This is based on the Prophet’s saying to the person who
prayed incorrectly,  “then be at ease until you are at ease in bowing.”
[4]
And remaining in that position until you attain
""calmness.""
Speaking about the importance of this matter, he said, “The
worst people are the thieves who steal part of the prayer.”  He was asked how
this was done, and he replied, “He does not complete his bowings and
prostrations,” or he said, “He does not straighten his back during his bowings
and prostrations.”
[5]
“The prayer of one who does not straighten his back in
his bowings and prostrations is not accomplished.”
[6]
5. Rising up from bowing
This is based on the
hadith
, “then rise till you
are standing straight.” (Bukhari, Muslim)
6. Prostration
This is based on the
hadith
, “then prostrate till
you are at ease in prostration.”
7. Sitting between the two prostrations
This is based on the
hadith
, “then rise up till
you are at ease sitting.”
8. Attaining calmness
A person prayed too fast without attaining calmness. The
Prophet disapproved his speed and said, “you did not pray.”
Attaining calmness means that each body part assumes the
appropriate position before one moves from one position to another.
9. Reciting the final
tashahhud
This will be done in the final sitting of the prayer. The
words of the
tashahhud
were taught by Prophet himself.  Ibn Mas’ud said,
a companion of the Prophet, said, “Before it was made obligatory to say the
tashahhud
,
we used to say, ‘Peace be upon Allah, and peace be upon Gabriel and Michael.’
Then the Messenger of Allah said, ‘Do not say that but say, ‘All compliments
are for Allah…’”
[7]
.
10.   Sitting to recite the final
tashahhud
This will be the final sitting of the prayer.
11. Sending blessings on the Prophet after the final
tashahhud
This is to be done after reciting the final
tashahhud
.
12. Saying ‘
As-Salamu
’
Alaikum
wa-Rahmatullah
’ to conclude the prayer
In an obligatory prayer it has to be said twice, however
in the funeral prayer it is sufficient to say it once.
13. Order
All the “essential components” of salah need to be
performed in the correct order.
Acts That Invalidate the Prayer
There are certain acts that if done, would invalidate
the prayer. What that means is that a person has to start over the prayer from
the beginning.
1. Being certain that you broke the
wudoo
A man complained to the Messenger of Allah about feeling
something  (in his abdomen) in the prayer. The Prophet said, “Do not turn away
(from
salah
) unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.”
[8]
This does not mean you only turn away from
salah
when you hear a sound or notice a smell. As long as you are
sure
you
broke wind and passed gas, your
wudoo
is broken and  you must make it
again and start the prayer from the beginning.
2. Intentionally not performing a
rukn
or prerequisite
of prayer without a valid excuse
This is based on the Prophet saying to the man who did
not pray properly, “Go back and pray for you h"

Etiquette of Calling the
Adhan
(1)  It is recommended for the man calling the
adhan
should be clean from major or minor impurities.
(2)  The
adhan
is given standing and facing the
qiblah
(the direction of the
Kabah
).
(3)      The caller turns with
his head to the right upon saying “Hayya ‘alas-salah” and to the left upon saying
“
Hayya ‘alal-falah
.”
(5)  The index finger is put in the ears.
(6)  The voice is to be raised, even if a man is
alone.  Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, one of the Prophet’s companions, said to one of
his students, “I see that you love the sheep and the desert.  If you are with
your sheep or in the desert, then raise your voice while making the call to
prayer, for any jinn, human or thing within hearing distance of your voice will
be a witness for you on the Day of Resurrection...I heard the Messenger of
Allah say that.”
[4]
(8)  It is better not to speak to a man while he is
calling the
adhan
or
iqamah
.

Collection, London, by Jean-Leon Gerome (1824-1904) a French painter.
Women &
Adhan
Can a woman call the
adhan
around men, or among a
group of Muslim women, or if she is by herself? By the agreement of Muslim
scholars, a Muslim woman is forbidden to call the
adhan
in the company
of men.  Allah has not charged her with calling the worshippers to the mosque. 
However, if she is in a group of Muslim women or by herself, she may call the
adhan
and
iqamah
in a low voice.
Responding to the
Adhan
It is preferred for one who
is reciting the Quran, engaged in
dhikr
(Allah’s remembrance), or
studying, that he stop what he is doing and repeat the
adhan
after the
caller to prayer.  After it is over, one may resume.  A person repeats each
phrase after the

7.    A person must not rush to catch up prayer
that is in progress at entering the
masjid
, because the Prophet forbade
rushing in such a situation. Prophet Muhammad said:
“If the prayer started, then do not join it
running, but join it walking and do it calmly, and pray whatever you caught up
with, and make up for what you missed.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
If a Muslim arrives late to a prayer, he should say “
Allahu
Akbar
” and join the congregation. If a
rakah
was joined after
ruku’
,
then the entire
rakah
needs to be repeated after the prayer. So when the
imam finishes with the prayer then you should stand up and make-up what you
missed.
It is appropriate to join the back row and fill in all
the spaces. If there is no more room, then a new row should start directly
behind the imam, and more latecomers fill out to the right and to the left.
Sisters should begin a new row in front if the row starts in the back.
8.    One should keep quiet during the prayer. During
the congregational prayer, there is no good reason for making a lot of noise
while people are trying to pray, yet conversations can sometimes be heard
during the prayer! Children should be trained to stay near their parent in prayer
if possible, or if not, they should not be brought to the
masjid
to pray.
9.    The Muslim should not distract others praying
in the
masjid
, because a person in prayer is in contact with Allah.
Causing distraction is quite a serious matter - people should not be disturbed
by actions such as reciting the Quran loudly.
10.  The one who enters the
masjid
should
not sit until he prays two
rakahs
. You pray them the same way you pray
the two
rakahs
of the obligatory
Fajr
prayer. The reason you pray
them is to show respect to the
masjid
before sitting down. The Prophet
said:
“When one of you enters the
masjid
, he
should pray two
rakah
before sitting down.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh
Muslim
)
11.   If
an individual is praying outside of the congregation (optional prayers, or obligatory
prayers alone), he should place something in front of him during prayer as a
barrier between himself and the passersby in front of him. It can be a chair, a
wall, or a pillar. He should also come a little close to it as the Prophet used
to do. Prophet Muhammad said:
“If you pray, then pray toward a
sutrah
(barrier) and get close to it.” (
Abu Daud
)
It is not necessary to have a barrier in front of a
person if praying in congregation, except for the
imam
, whose barrier
acts for the congregation.
12.  Muslims are not supposed to walk in front of a
person praying. If a person is praying with a
sutrah
(barrier), let’s
say behind a chair, then you cannot walk between the person and the chair, but
beyond the chair. Prophet Muhammad said: “If one knew (the sin) of passing in
front of one who is praying, he would rather wait for forty than to pass in
front of him.” Abu al-Nadr - one of the
hadith
narrators, said: “I do
not remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years.” (Bukhari,
Muslim)
13.  The Muslim should sit where he finds a place
in the
masjid
. The Muslim should not jump over people or squeeze himself
between two people who are already sitting so as not to bother or harm them. Many
ahadith
of the Prophet convey this meaning.
14.   Instead of chatting and gossiping, it is
better for a Muslim to keep himself busy supplicating and remembering Allah,
because he is considered as if in the prayer as long as he is waiting for the
prayer.
15.  The Muslim should keep the
masjid
clean
and tidy, and fragrant because it is the house of Allah. The Prophet considered
spitting in the
masjid
to be a sin that could be forgiven only if the Muslim
cleans the area. The Prophet of Islam said:
“Spitting in the
masjid
is a sin and its
expiation is to clean it.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
The Companions of the Prophet used to keep the
masjid
clean, like the famous Companion, Ibn Umar, used to put perfume inside the
masjid
when Umar, his father, sat on the pulpit to deliver Friday sermon (Abu Daud). Traditional
incense or modern day sprays and electric devices can be used for the purpose.
16.  The Muslim should not walk out of the
masjid
after the
Adhan
has been given before he prays that prayer with other Muslims
in congregation. Let us say you have prayed
Dhuhr
earlier at home or
another
masjid
, then you go to "

Wajibaat
(Obligatory acts) of
Salah
They are those acts that have to be performed in the prayer.  If a
wajib
act is left
intentionally
, the prayer is invalidated.  However if it is
left
unintentionally
then one must perform the “prostration of
forgetfulness” to make up for it.  This will be covered in more detail in a
later lesson.
The following are the obligations of the prayer:
1.  Saying ‘
Allahu Akbar
’ when moving from one position
to another
The Prophet used to say
Allahu Akbar
every time
he went down or rose.
[1]
2.  Words while bowing (
ruku’
)
To say: ‘
Subha-na Rabbi al-
’
Adheem’
(Exalted and perfect is my Lord,
the Great) once.  To say beyond that is a recommended act.
3.  Words upon standing up from
ruku’
The Prophet said, “When he (the
imam
) says:
Sami
’
-Allahu li-man hamidah
(Allah hears the
one who praises him),
then you all say:
Rabba-na wa lakal-hamd
(To our Lord is all praise and thanks).“ (Agreed upon)
Both these are to be said when you are praying by
yourself.  However when you are praying behind an
imam
then you only say
‘
Rabba-na wa lakal-hamd
’
.
4.  Words while prostrating
To say: ‘
Subha-na
Rabbi al-A’la
’ (Exalted and perfect is my Lord, the All-High) once.  To say
beyond that is a recommended act.
5.  Supplication between two prostrations
To say ‘
Rabbig-fir lee
’ once.  To say beyond that
is a recommended act.
6.  First
Tashahhud
To recite the first
tashahhud.
This takes place
in the first “long sitting” of those prayers which are more than 2 units.
Once, the Prophet forgot the first
tashahhud
, but
he did not repeat the prayer, instead he made up for it with the “prostration
of forgetfulness.” This shows that this is a
wajib
act; if it were an “essential
component”, then the “prostration of forgetfulness” would not have been
sufficient.
7.  Sitting to recite the first
Tashahhud
To sit to recite the first
tashahhud
.
Recommended Acts of Prayer
The following are some of the recommended acts of
prayer:
1.  Opening Supplication
It is only to be said in the first
rakah
.
The most common prayer is the following:
“
Subhaana-kallaa-humma
wa biham-dika, wa tabaa-ra-kasmu-ka, wa ta’aa-laa jad-du-ka, wa laa ilaa-ha
ghay-ruk
.”
(You are Glorified, O
Allah, and Praised; Your Name is blessed; Your Majesty is Exalted, and none has
the right to worshipped but You).  (Abu Daud).
2.  Seeking Refuge in Allah
It is to be said in the first
rakah
by simply
saying,
“
Aa’oodhu billahi
min ash-Shaitan nir-rajim
”
‘I seek refuge with Allah, from the Devil, the Rejected
One.’
3.  Saying ‘
Ameen’
The word ‘
Ameen’
is not part of
Surah
al-Fatihah, but rather a supplication meaning, “O Allah, respond.”
It is to be said after reciting
Surah
al-Fatihah.
The Prophet said, “When the imam says
Ameen
, you
should say
Ameen
.  If this corresponds with when the angels say it, then
he will have all of his previous sins forgiven.”
[2]
4.  Reciting a portion of the Quran after reciting
Surah
al-Fatihah in the first two units
You can recite any portion of the Quran.  For example you
can recite short chapters such as
Surah
al-Ikhlas,
Surah
al-Falaq,
or
Surah
an-Naas.
5.  Supplicating after sending blessings on the Prophet in
the final sitting of the prayer
One can say:
“
Allaahumma innee
’
a’oothu bika min ’athaabil-qabr, wa min
’
athaabi jahannama, wa min fitnatil-mahyaa
wal-mamaati, wa min sharri fitna-til-masee-hid-dajjaal
.”
(O Allah!  I truly seek
refuge with You from the punishment of the grave, and from the punishment of
the Hellfire, and from the trials of living (meaning the trials of this life
and temptations a person faces) and dying (it means either the trial at the
time of death or the punishment of the grave), and from the evil [trials] of
the Anti-Christ.).
[3]
6.  Raising one’s hands
To raise one’s hands when saying the opening
takbir
,
when bowing, and rising from the bowing and when standing from the first “long
sitting” (where one recites the first
tashahhud
).
7.  Putting the right hand over the left upon the chest
To put the right hand over the left upon the chest.

The ritual prayer (
salah
[1]
)
is the heartbeat of Islamic worship, a living expression of Islam.  It keeps a
Muslim in permanent contact with Allah.  The recitation of the Quran, the
sacred scripture of Islam, is an inseparable element of the prayer.  In it, one
finds the purest expression of the essential elements of Islam.  Being a ritual
act of devotion to Allah, it has two faces: the legal prescription and the
spiritual dimension.  We shall discuss the latter in this lesson.
The first duty on a person upon becoming Muslim
is the performance of the prayers. The prayers are obligatory on every Muslim
man and woman five times a day throughout their life once they declare Islam.  The
prayer (
salah
) is the second pillar of Islam, after the two Testimonies. 
Whether one is rich or poor, healthy or sick, traveling or resident, a Muslim
must pray.
[2]
Every
Muslim should learn the rules and regulations of praying correctly and pray
five times a day.  Learning and performing the prayer should be the first
priority of every new Muslim.  If you are new to Islam, incorporating a new
religious practice done in an unfamiliar language may feel strange and intimidating,
but soon with patience and Allah’s help it will become part of your life.  Prayer
to a Muslim is as important as breathing, and  it isn’t as difficult as it may
seem!
The prayer revolves around three supreme
realities in a Muslim’s life: Allah, His Prophet, and the community of
believers.  Allah is constantly praised, glorified, thanked, and remembered in prayer
(
salah
).  A Muslim turns himself inwardly and outwardly to Allah.  The
method of the prayer is that of the Prophet in which he is mentioned as well.  Lastly,
the prayer ties one to the community of the faithful, especially when performed
in the mosque with a local congregation.
The prayer (
salah
) is considered the most
important act of worship prescribed for human beings.  It is the backbone of
religious observance of a Muslim. Without a spine, the human body would
collapse. Similarly, without the prayer a person’s Islamic practice would fall
apart. The Prophet himself compared it to the spine:
“The head of all affairs is Islam, its
spine is the prayer (
salah
)…”
(Al-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)
Emphasizing its importance, the Prophet said:
“Between a person and disbelief is discarding
the prayer (
salah
).”
[3]
What this means is that if a man stops to pray
completely, he slides into disbelief.
There are quite a few other points which emphasize
the importance of the prayer (
salah
), from them the following:
- The Prophet at his death bed advised the
Muslims to pay attention to
salah
.
[4]
- It was the first act of worship made
compulsory on Muslims who were required to observe the prayer while in Mecca
before migration to Medina.  Compulsory charity (
Zakat
[5]
),
fasting, and pilgrimage were made compulsory in Medina.
- The first matter we will be questioned about
on the Day of Judgment is
salah
:
“The first matter which a slave will be
held to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer (
salah
).  If it
is good, all the rest of his deeds become good, but if it is bad, all the rest
of his deeds become bad.”
[6]
- Abraham asked his Lord to give him descendants
who would abide by their prayers:
“My Lord! Cause me and (some) of my offspring to
remain constant in prayer.  And O our Lord!  Accept my supplication” (Quran 14:40)
The Quran is full of commands to pray to
emphasize its importance.  The prayer has been divinely transmitted to us in
two ways.  First, Allah Himself commanded Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, when he ascended into the heavens in a journey
known as the
Mi’raaj
(The Ascension).  The commandment for the prayer (
salah
)
was not brought down by an angel to the Prophet, but the Prophet was taken up
to the heavens, and Allah addressed him directly in its obligation.  Second,
the great angel Gabriel descended to teach the Prophet the five prayers and
their times.

·To understand how the Friday prayer is
conducted and who is required to pray.

Khutbah

·
Khatib

On Fridays, the
Dhuhr
(afternoon
prayer) is replaced with a what is known as
Salat ul-Jumuah
.
Salat
ul-Jumuah
consists of a short sermon and a congregational prayer. The Friday
prayer
cannot
be done at home or prayed individually. That is why
Muslims gather in a central mosque to pray and listen to a sermon, known as
khutbah
in Arabic. It is common for a designated
Imam
(prayer leader) to give
the
khutbah
, but sometimes this is done by invited guests or general members
of a community.
In the West, sermons are mostly delivered
in English, however sometimes they are only in Arabic. In any case, at least
part of the sermon is always in Arabic. The sermon is made of two parts. After
the first part is over, the
khatib
(person delivering the
khutbah
)
takes a short break and sits, and then resumes it. The quality of a sermon
greatly differs depending on the speaker who might be a knowledgeable scholar
of Islam or a lay person. The speaker will praise Allah and then discuss issues
relevant to the Muslim community. Afterwards, the
Imam
will lead the
congregation in a short prayer of two
rakahs
.
Salat ul-Jumuah
(the
sermon and the prayer), usually lasts for an hour or less.
Men Must Pray
Salat ul-Jumuah
The Friday prayer is compulsory and
required from all Muslim
men
. This is based on the Quran in which Allah
says,
“O you who believe, when the call to prayer (
Adhan
)
is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and
leave trade aside. That is better for you, if you did but know.” (Quran 62:9)
Prophet Muhammad has stated very
clearly who is required to pray
Salat ul-Jumuah
and who is exempt:
“The Friday prayer in congregation
is an obligatory duty on every Muslim except four: a slave, a woman, a child,
and a sick person.”
[1]
To be precise, Friday prayer is
required from every Muslim male who has reached puberty. Others can attend it,
but are not sinful if they don’t.
Additionally, Prophet Muhammad has
given a stern warning against missing the Friday prayers. He said,
“People should stop missing Friday
prayers otherwise Allah will put a seal on their hearts and thus they will be
among the heedless.”
[2]
A Muslim man who is sick or travelling
may miss the Friday prayer. A Muslim woman is not required to pray the Friday
prayer, but she is allowed to attend the prayers if she wants to. Most mosques have
separate seating arrangements for women, but some may lack women’s area for
praying the Friday prayer. Also, the women who decide not to attend the
Salat
ul-Jumuah
should offer the regular
Dhuhr
prayer at home.
Wisdom Behind Friday Prayer
1.    The Friday prayer brings
local Muslims together in one place on a fixed day, thereby increasing the
bonds of brotherhood between Muslims.
2.    The purpose of the
khutbah
(sermon) is to educate the Muslims and serves as a weekly reminder about their duties
to Allah and fellow human beings. It warns against sin and disobeying Allah,
and encourages to be good and to obey Allah.
3.    The topics are varied and
often update the Muslims on current affairs and as Muslim what should be their
role.
Virtues of Friday
Friday is a virtuous day with many
special qualities.
1.    Prophet Muhammad said:
“When it is a Friday, the angels
stand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons
coming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of
the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a
camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a
ram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out
(for the Friday prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the
Khutbah
.”
[3]
This narration shows the reward of
coming early to the Friday prayer. The earlier a person arrives, the greater
his reward. The first arrival attains the reward of sacrificing a camel for
Allah, but those who arrive later receive lesser rewards.
2.    He also said:
“The best day on which the sun has
ever risen is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted into
Paradise, and on it he was expelled from it, and the Hour will not be
established except on Friday.”
[4]
The purpose of this narration is to tell
us of the magnificent events that took place on Friday or will take place.

·In the firstlesson, we discussed the
basics of ablution (
wudoo
). In this lesson, we will describe how to
perform ablution in a little more detail, and mention the
ahadith
from
which this method is derived.
Arabic Terms
·
Nafl

·
Hadith
- (plural –
ahadith
) is
a piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
·
Wudoo
– ablution.
The Virtues of Ablution
By the ultimate grace of Allah,
He commands us with certain obligations, and then also rewards us for their
fulfillment. Performing ablution as well has many virtues associated with it,
from forgiveness of sins to it being a mark of recognition on the Day of Judgment.
The following are an example of some of the
ahadith
which mention these
rewards.
(1)  Messenger of Allah,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“When a Muslim or a
believer performs ablution and washes his face, every lesser sin that he
committed as a result of looking washes away with water (or with the last drop
of water). When he washes his hands, every sin that his hands committed washes
away with water (or with the last drop of water). When he washes his feet,
every sin to which he proceeded washes away with water (or with the last drop
of water) until he emerges pure and sin free..” (
Muslim
)
(2)  Messenger of Allah said:
“Shall I inform you (of an
act) by which Allah erases sins and raises degrees?  They (his Companions) said,
‘Certainly, O Messenger of Allah.’  He said, ‘Perfecting the ablution under
difficult circumstances, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for the
(next) prayer after the (last) prayer has been performed.  That is
ribat
[1]
.’” (
Saheeh
Muslim
)
(3)  Messenger of Allah
passed by a grave site and said:
“Peace be upon you, the
abode of the believing people, and soon we as well, if Allah so wills, are
about to join you. I love to see my brothers.”
They (his Companions)
said: “Aren’t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah?”
He said: “You are my
Companions; our brothers are those who have not yet come into the world.”
They said: “O Messenger of
Allah, how would you recognize those persons of your nation [on the Day of
Judgment] who have not yet been born?”
He replied: “Suppose a man
had horses with white blazes on their foreheads and legs among other horses
which were all black. Tell me, would he not recognize his own horses?”
They said: “Certainly, O
Messenger of Allah.”
He said: “They [those who
have not come yet] will come with white faces, arms and legs owing to ablution,
and I will arrive at the Cistern
[2]
before them. Some people will be driven away from my Cistern as a
stray camel is driven away. I will call out: ‘Come, come.’ Then it will be said
(to me): ‘These people changed [the religion by innovating in it] after you,’
and I will say: ‘Be off, be off.’” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
On the Day of Judgment, the
Muslim nation will be distinguished from other nations by the body parts which
they washed for ablution which will be emanating with light:
“My people will be called
to presence on the Day of Judgment with bright faces, arms and legs from the
traces of ablution.” (
al-Bukhari
)
The Method of Performing Ablution
Allah, the Exalted, says
in the Quran:
“O you who believe! When
you intend to offer the prayer, wash your faces and from your hands up to the
elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.” (Quran 5:6)
Prophet Muhammad also said:
“Allah does not accept any
prayer performed without being in a state of purity.”
(Muslim)
The Prophet practically taught
us how to perform ablution, as he was sent to explain the revelation of the
Quran. The following is a step by step guide explaining what exactly is to be
washed and how, gathered from various texts of
hadith
.
(1)  You must have the
intention of purifying yourself from a state of ritual impurity
[3]
.  This means that you
should bring into your mind that you are performing this
wudoo
in order
to enter a state of ritual purity. This intention is in the heart and is
not
to be
uttered.
(2)  Begin with the name
of Allah, by saying ‘
Bismillaah
’.
(3)  Then, wash your hands
three times each. You should always start with the right whenever washing the
body parts..
(4)  Rinse your mouth
three times, swirling the water around inside your mouth (gargling), and then rinse
your nose three times by inhaling some water into your nostrils and blowing the
water out. Use your left hand to remove the water from your nose.
(5)  Wash your face three
times, from the hairline to the jawbone and chin, and from ear to ear.  A man
should wet the hair of his beard because it is part of the face.  If his beard
is thin he has to wash it inside and out, and if it is thick and covers the

When is it Better, but not Required, to Perform
Ghusl
?
There are certain occasions when it is recommended and
rewardable for a Muslim to perform
ghusl
.  Some of them are listed here:
(1)      For the Friday Prayer (
Salat ul-Jumuah
in Arabic).
It is better to perform
ghusl
on Friday
before
Salat ul-Jumuah
.
[1]
The
time extends between Friday dawn and the time of the Friday prayer.  Although it
may not be possible for many to perform
ghusl
right before the prayerdue to work or school, they can do so before they leave in the morning. If
one breaks his
wudoo
after performing
ghusl
, it is sufficient to
make new
wudoo
without bathing again.
(2)      For the Bi-Annual Eid prayers.
A Muslim is encouraged to perform
ghusl
for
Eid
prayers.  Many reports from the Companions have been reported regarding
this matter.
(3)      On entering Mecca.
It is preferable for whoever wants to enter Mecca to perform
ghusl
.
[2]
(4)
Ghusl
after washing a corpse.
Performing
ghusl
is preferred for one who
has washed a corpse.
[3]
Ghusl
for Women
A woman bathes as outlined above, except that if
she has braided hair she does not have to undo it, provided the water can reach
the roots of her hair.
[4]
It
is sufficient for her to pour water over her head three times, making sure that
the water completely reaches the roots of her hair.
Also, nail polish or any other agent which prevents
water from reaching the body parts must be removed at the time of
ghusl
.
[5]
It is preferable for a woman, after performing
ghusl
due to menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding, to take some cotton smeared
with fragrance and wipe her private parts, in order to cleanse herself from the
odor of the menstrual blood.
[6]
Ghusl
is not required in the following
two cases:
(i)   Normal vaginal discharge.  It is
normal for a vagina to be naturally moist with a kind of mucus.  It changes
throughout the monthly cycle in response to the body’s hormone production.  Most
normal young and older women have a white, sticky discharge called leucorrhea,
a liquid quite distinct from orgasmic fluid.  It’s normal for women to get a
little discharge on their clothing.  The secretions can be more inclined to
wetness or dryness, and be more or less thick or viscous.  These secretions may
turn white or yellow when exposed to the air.  Normal vaginal fluids can have a
mild scent, or no aroma at all, and can be clear or milky white when moist,
yellowish in color when dried, and mucus-like or stringy in consistency.  They
can be heavier during mid-cycle, when ovulation occurs, during pregnancy, and
when using birth control pills.
Ghusl
is not required in such cases.
(ii)  Foreplay, thinking about intercourse
and sexual arousal causes veins to dilate.  This swelling creates a “sweating
reaction,” producing a fluid that lubricates the vagina and wets the entrance. 
The combination of vaginal mucus and lubrication makes up women’s sexual
secretions.  It can be white and thin and is
not
followed by feeling of
exhaustion.  This fluid is called
madhiy
in Arabic.
Ghusl
is not
required in this case as well.
A woman is considered sexually impure and must
perform
ghusl
in two cases:
(a)  Insertion of the penis in the vagina,
even if there is no ejaculation, renders both husband and wife sexually impure. 
Both require
ghusl
to resume worship.
(b)  Emission of the vaginal fluid called
maniy
due to wet-dream
[7]
and
female orgasm.
A woman has to do
ghusl
if she
experiences an erotic dream and notices
moisture
when she wakes up.
Also,
ghusl
becomes obligatory when
maniy
is produced after female orgasm due to any other reason for that matter.  Orgasm
is the climax of sexual activity accompanied by vaginal contractions and other
changes in the body, and commonly results from sexual intercourse.
[8]
Certain indicators like smell and color
distinguish
maniy
from normal vaginal discharge.  Women’s
maniy
,
the fluid which requires
ghusl
, is known by several qualities:
(a)  it is released as a result of feeling
sexual pleasure and a woman feels excitement when it is produced.
(b)  it is followed by a feeling of
exhaustion.
(c)  it has a particular odor.
[9]
(d)  it is usually yellow and non-viscous. It
can be white.
The first two qualities are perhaps the most
important indicators. Vaginal discharges described above that do
not
meet

·To learn ten etiquettes and duties on
Friday.
Arabic Terms:
·Salat
ul-Jumuah
- Friday Prayer.
·
Dhuhr
- the afternoon prayer.
·
Khutbah
- sermon.
·
Rakah
- unit of prayer.
·
Imam
- someone who leads the prayer.
·
Adhan
- an Islamic way of calling Muslims to the five
obligatory prayers.
Etiquette and Duties on Friday
1.       Wear Clean Clothes & Smell Good
Prophet Muhammad said,
“Every Muslim should have a ritual bath on Friday and wear his best clothing,
and if he has perfume, he should use it”
[1]
2.       Send Blessings on the Prophet
It is highly recommended to send peace and blessings on
Prophet Muhammad on Fridays as the Prophet said,
“Invoke blessings on me,
many times over, on Friday and the night (preceding it); for whoever does so, I
will be a witness and intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.”
[2]
This is done by simply saying and repeating the words,
“
Allahumma
sal-ly wa sal-lim ‘Ala Muhammad
.”
Repeating these simple words anytime
during Friday brings great blessings as mentioned in the above report form
Prophet Muhammad.
3.       Increase Supplication
A Muslim should increase his supplication to Allah on
Friday because there is a time on Friday when Allah responds and gives whatever
good He is asked for. The Prophet said,
“There is an hour on Friday in which
no Muslim asks during it except that Allah grants him whatever he asks for.”
[3]
One can supplicate in any language he wants. The
etiquettes of supplication have been covered in previous lessons.
4.       Arrive Early at the Mosque
Prophet Muhammad said,
“Whoever takes a bath on
Friday like the one taken to purify oneself from sexual impurity, then he
leaves at the earliest time, then he is like the one who offers a camel; the
one who comes after that is like one who offers a cow; the one who comes after
that is like one who offers a horned ram; the one who comes after that is like
one who offers a chicken; the one who comes after that is like one who offers
an egg. When the
Imam
arrives, the angels are present to listen to the
remembrance (meaning the
khutbah
).”
[4]
If a person comes late, he should not step over people
already sitting in rows, nor separate two people sitting together. He should
also not move another person and take their place. A Muslim should not walk
directly in front of a person praying.
5.       Sit Close to the
Imam
A person must try to arrive early and sit close to the
Imam
delivering the sermon. Sitting closer to the
Imam
is better than sitting
behind in the back rows or reclining next to a wall. If a new Muslim finds it
hard to sit on the floor for half an hour or so, he may sit where ever he feels
comfortable, but he should try to get accustomed to sitting closer to the
Imam
.
6.       Don’t Talk During the
Khutbah
Also, a Muslim should pay attention to the sermon and
not talk during it, even if it is delivered in Arabic. Talking during the
Friday prayer is a serious matter. Prophet Muhammad said,
“If you say to
your friend, ‘Be quiet,’ on Friday when the
Imam
is delivering the
sermon, then you have uttered non-sense.”
[5]
In another narration, the Prophet said,
“…whoever
utters nonsense is considered as if he has not attended the Friday prayer!”
[6]
7.       Pray Two
Rakahs
For Entering the Mosque
Before Sitting Down
If you arrive to the mosque early, you should pray two
rakahs
before sitting down. If you arrive while the
Imam
is delivering the
sermon, you should still pray them, but make it short. The Prophet said,
“If
anyone of you enters the mosque on Friday while the
Imam
is delivering
the
khutbah
, let him perform two
rakahs
and be brief in doing
so.”
[7]
8.       Don’t Buy or Sell Once the
Adhan
Has Been
Called
This prohibition is based on the Quran itself,
“... when the
Adhan
is proclaimed for the prayer on
Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trading aside...” (Quran 62:9)
9.    The Friday prayer which consists of two
rakahs
is performed after the sermon behind an
Imam
. Someone who misses it
should pray four
rakahs
of regular
Dhuhr
prayer.
10.  You can pray two or four
rakahs
of
Sunnah
(recommended) prayer after the Friday prayer.
Making Arrangements with the Employer for Time Off for
Salat
ul-Jumuah
Countless Muslims take time off from their businesses,
schools, and employers to attend the Friday prayer. Friday prayer is a
religious obligation and a new Muslim should make arrangements with their
school or employer to take time off for attending it. You can make up the lost
hours by working extra during the week or staying late on Friday.

Table 1 lists the five daily prayers and the
number of units (

) for each obligatory (
fard
) prayer.
Which Direction Do I pray in?
A Muslim is required to face
the direction of the
Kabah
(the Sacred House of Allah in Mecca) for each
prayer
salah
.  The
Kabah
is the first house built to worship
humanity’s One, True Lord.  All Muslims throughout the world face it when they
pray, leaving the world behind them whilst submitting themselves to their
Sustainer.  This direction is called the
qiblah
and it is fairly easy to
figure it out.
Again, you have several options
to figure out the direction of prayer (
qiblah
).
(1)  Ask a fellow Muslim
which in which direction you need to pray.
(2)
http://www.islamicfinder.org/
will
tell you where the
Kabah
is located from where you are.
(3)  Some wrist watches
are available in the market that make finding the direction of prayer quite
easy, especially when one is in an unfamiliar place or traveling.  They can be
ordered online
[1]
.
Getting Ready for Prayer (
Salah
)
1.    The prayer is
obligatory on every adult, sane Muslim once the time for a certain prayer has
started.
2.    Minimum clothing
requirements must be met by both men and women for prayer.
A
Muslim man must wear clothing that at least covers him from navel to knee, and
make sure that his shoulders are covered.
A
Muslim woman must wear loose clothing that covers her whole body, including her
head (and ears) and feet. She need not cover her hands and face.
3.    A Muslim must be in
the state of purity, meaning the person:
·should perform
wudoo
(ablution)
if he has passed wind, urinated, defecated or woke up from sleep since the last
time he performed
wudoo
.
·should perform the
ghusl
(ritual bath) if he woke up from a wet-dream, ejaculated semen, had intercourse
and additionally, in case of a woman, she ended her monthly cycle or her
post-childbirth bleeding.
4.    He must make sure
there is no impurity on his clothes, body, or the spot he will pray.
5.    He should face the direction
of prayer (
qiblah
).
6.    Make intention to
perform the prayers in the heart.
7.    The formal prayer
(salah
) must be offered in Arabic, so please read the transliteration of
the Arabic text provided at the end of ‘Prayer for Beginners (part 2 of 2)’.
The translation is given just to help know what you are saying.

The Prayer
The Prophet has commanded us:
“Pray as you have seen me praying.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
)
The following is a simple procedure for
performing the formal prayer for beginners. You will learn more, later.
Also, you may find Muslims praying slightly
differently. There is no reason to worry. Do not focus on little details at
this moment. Learn the basics first as presented over here.
Description of a 2 unit prayer (like the
Fajr
prayer)
1.   Standing
straight
·Stand straight facing the
qiblah
(direction
of prayer).
2.   The
  Opening Takbir (pronouncing of Allahu Akbar)
·Raise both hands up to the earlobes or
  shoulders and say:
Allahu akbar
‘Allah is the Greatest.’
Figure 1
·Place your right hand and arm on top of
  your left and place them both on your chest.
·Do not look around. Keep your eyes focused
  on the spot where you will prostrate.
Figure 2
3.   Seeking
  refuge with Allah from Satan
·Say:
A
'
udhu
  billahi minash-shaytaanir-rajeem
‘I seek refuge with Allah from the Evil One.’
4.  Reciting
Surah al-Fatihah
,
Begin
  with saying:
Bismilla-hir-rahma-nir-raheem
‘I begin with the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.’
·Then recite
Surah al-Fatih
ah
.
Alhamdu lil-lahi
  rab-bil 'alameen
‘Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
Ar-rahma-nir-raheem
The Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.

Not the (path) of those who earn Your anger
wa-lad-daa-leen
nor of those who go astray.’
·Finally, say:
Aameen
O Allah, please accept.
5.   Bowing
·Raise your hands up to the earlobes or
  shoulders (as you did in 2. The Opening
Takbeer
) and say:
Allahu akbar
‘Allah is the Greatest.’

  bowing posture as shown in the picture, and repeat in a low voice three times:
Subhana rabbi-yal-'azeem
‘How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme!’
Figure 3
6.   Standing up from
  the bowing posture
·As in the picture, stand up straight from
  the bowing posture till your back comes to its normal upright position.
·While rising up from the bowing posture,
  raise your hands up to the earlobes or shoulders again and say:
Sami' allahu liman
  hamidah
‘Allah listens to the one who praises Him.’

Rab-bana wa lakal
  hamd
Our Lord, and to You be all Praise.’
Figure 4
7.   First prostration
·Then go down on the ground to prostrate.
  While going down, say:
Allahu akbar
‘Allah is the Greatest.’
·Your forehead, nose, both hands, knees,
  and feet should be touching the ground while in prostration. If doing it for
  the first time, it may be slightly uncomfortable, depending on how flexible
  your body is!  You will get used to it pretty soon. Remember the person is
  closest to Allah in prostration.
·Repeat in a low voice three times:
Subhana rabbi-yal-a'laa
‘How Perfect is my Lord, the Most   High.’
Figure 5
8.   Sitting between
  the prostrations
·Now you will sit up from the first
  prostration. Sit all the way back till you sit in a comfortable position.

‘Allah is the Greatest.’
·Repeat, while sitting between the two
  prostrations:
Rab-bigh-fir lee
‘O my Lord!  Forgive me.’
Figure 6
9.   Second prostration
·Then go again to the position of
prostration. While going down to prostrate, say:
Allahu akbar
‘Allah is the Greatest.’
·Perform this prostration like the first.  Repeat
in a low voice three times:
Subhana rabbi-yal-a'laa
‘How Perfect is my Lord, the Most High.’
·Steps 4-9 are called one unit or
rakah
in Arabic.
10.  Next unit of prayer (
rakah

prayer. While standing up say:
Allahu akbar
‘Allah is the Greatest.’
·Repeat steps 4 to 9 again.
11.  Recitation in the sitting position (
Tashahud
)
·Then come to the sitting position. While
sitting up say:
Allahu akbar
‘Allah is the Greatest.’
·When sitting, say

it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of

·
Ghusl

What is Ablution (
Wudoo
)?
Wudoo
, translated as ablution, is done before
certain acts of worship. It is basically washing of one's face, hands and arms,
then wiping the head and ears, and finally washing the feet.
When Should I Perform Ablution (
Wudoo
)?
A Muslim must perform ablution before he performs
the prayer (
salah
) if he enters a state of ritual impurity, namely due
to one of the following causes:
(1)  Breaking wind.
(2)  Urination.
(3)  Defecation (passing feces).
(4)  Deep sleep.
These things are considered to ‘invalidate’ or
‘break’ ablution (
wudoo
).  For example, you must perform ablution after waking
up in the morning to pray your morning prayer (
salah
), because sleeping
“breaks” the  ablution. After using the toilet, you have to perform  ablution before
you can perform prayer because urinating and defecating “break” the  ablution.
How to Perform Ablution?
Before you perform ablution, you should make
sure your body parts are not soiled with impurities. Make sure you have wiped
off all traces of urine or feces with toilet paper or water after having used
the toilet.
Ablution is done in the following order:
1.    Intend in your heart that you are
performing  ablution in order to enter a state of purity for
salah
.
2.    Begin with the name of Allah by
saying,
‘Bismillaah’
which means,
‘I begin with
the Name of Allah.’
3.    Rinse the mouth. This can be done
  once, twice or thrice. See Figure 1.
Figure 1
4.    Clean the nostrils by sniffing
  water and blowing it. This can be done once, twice or thrice. See Figure 2.
Figure 2
5.    Wash the face from the hairline to
  the chin and jawbone, from ear to ear. This can be done once, twice or
  thrice. See Figure 3.
Figure 3
6.    Wash the hands and arms up to and
  including the elbows. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the
  right hand.  See Figure 4.
Figure 4
7.    After wetting the hands again, wipe
  the entire head by putting the hands at the front of your head and take them
  to the back of the head, then bring them back to the place where you
  started.  This is to be done only once. See Figure 5.

What is Ritual Bath (
Ghusl
)?
Ghusl
is the Arabic word for a complete
bath. In certain cases, it is not enough to perform ablution before prayers.  One
needs to purify themselves by taking a full bath, that is doing the ritual bath
(
ghusl
), before they may pray.  You are required to do the ritual bath
in the following cases:
1.
The emission of semen or female orgasmic
fluid, whether due to sexual intercourse, wet dreams or masturbation.
2.
After sexual intercourse.  More
precisely, a bath has to be taken if the penis enters the vagina, regardless of
whether fluid was emitted or not.
3.
Menstruation and post-natal bleeding
[1]
.
4.
It is also preferred to perform theritual
bath upon entering Islam.
A female cannot offer
salah
(prayer) when
she is experiencing menstruation or postpartum bleeding.  After her bleeding
ends, she must purify herself by taking the ritual bath, and then she may resume
salah
(prayer).
How to Perform the Ritual Bath
(1) Intend in your heart to purify yourself
for Allah’s sake.
(2) Wash off any impurity that may be on
the body.
(3) Wash the entire body with water leaving
no part dry.
(4) Rinse the mouth and nose.
Footnotes:
[1]
Post-natal or post partum bleeding is that bleeding which occurs
after childbirth or miscarriage."

What is Prayer (
Salah
)?
·Prayer (
Salah
) is the formal
establishment of prayer required of a Muslim five times daily.  Prayer (
Salah
)
consists of specific statements and actions.
Getting Ready for Prayer (
Salah
)
The timings
:  The five daily prayers have
to be offered within a certain time range. They are
Fajr
,
Dhuhr
,
Asr
,
Magrib
and
Isha
, and you can find the prayer timings for your
city from this link:
http://www.islamicfinder.org/
The timings of the prayers vary from place to
place. And this is why you need to find the prayer timings for your specific
city.
The prayers do not need to be prayed exactly
when the time starts; rather, they can be prayed at any time before the next
prayer time starts, with the exception of
Fajr
and
Isha.
The
Fajr
prayer should be prayed before sunrise. For this reason, you will find the
time for sunrise listed on Prayer schedules, and this does not mean that there
is a special prayer for Sunrise.  And the
Isha
prayer should be prayed
till the middle of the night. However, due to necessity, the
Isha
prayer
can be prayed up to the beginning of
Fajr
time.
The direction
: You can use the same
website to find the direction of prayers. The website will display the bearing
on a compass after you have entered your city.
The dress
: A Muslim man should wear
something that at least covers him from the navel to the knees. A Muslim woman
must wear loose clothing that covers her entire body and hair leaving her face
and palms open.
State of Purity
: One should be in a state
of purity, by performing ablution (
wudoo’
) or ritual bath (
ghusl
)
[this was covered in Part 1]. Also one should make sure that there is no
impurity (such as urine or faeces) on one’s clothes or body. The prayers can be
done on any clean surface such as the floor, carpet or a rug. Dust, mud or
grease are considered ok and do not affect the prayers.
The Prayer (
Salah
)
The Prayer(
salah
) is to be said
in Arabic and requires some memorization, so, it usually takes a little time to
learn correctly and fully and get used to it.  Not knowing Arabic should not discourage
you; just pray the prayer (
salah
) to the best of your ability.
A new Muslim has to realize that the orders of
Allah are to be followed within the limit of his or her ability and endurance. 
If you find it difficult to memorize all of what is necessary for the prayers,
it may be a good idea in the meantime to write it on a piece of paper and read
them in prayer.  If you are unable to do even this, it is sufficient that you
say any or all of the following instead:
·
Subhanallah
‘How Perfect is Allah!’
·
Al-hamdu lil-lah
‘All
praise and thanks are for Allah’
·
La ilaha il-lal-lah
‘There is no god except Allah’
·
Allahu Akbar
‘Allah
is the Greatest’
Here is an example of a
2 unit prayer (like the
Fajr
prayer), based on the last method of
prayers explained above.
1.  Stand
straight facing the direction of prayer.
2.  Raise
  your hands up to the shoulders and say
Allahu Akbar
.
  See Figure 1.

Introduction
What should you do in
the situation where you have to pray
salah
(ritual prayer), yet neither
have no water suitable for making
wudoo
, nor the time be able to find
such water soon enough to pray on time?
What if you are sick and either not able to make
wudoo,
or making
wudoo
is detrimental to your health.  What is the correct
procedure in such a case?
The answer to these common questions is to perform a “dry”
ablution, which is called
tayammum
.
Tayammum
consists of using clean
soil or dust to wipe your face and hands with the intention of preparing
oneself to pray, and, as such, substitutes
wudoo
in special
circumstances.
The procedure and basic conditions of making
tayammum
are mentioned in the Quran and
Sunnah
.  The Quran says:
“And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from
relieving himself, or you have touched women, and you do not find water, then
perform
tayammum
with clean earth.  Certainly, Allah is ever Pardoning
and Forgiving.” (Quran 4:43)
The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said:
“All of the earth has been made a clean place to pray for me
and my nation.  Whenever a person from my nation wants to pray, he has
something with which to purify himself, that is, the earth.”
[1]
Tayammum
is one of the five blessings from Allah
to Muslims that He did not give to any other prophet before Prophet Muhammad,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.  The Prophet said:
“I have been given five things that were not given
to anyone before me: …the earth has been made a place of prayer for me - wherever
and whoever of my nation wants to pray, he may pray...”
[2]
Situations Where
Tayammum
Is Done
Tayammum
cannot be made at will or when one feels
wudoo
is inconvenient.  There are specific situations where it can be
made:
(1)  If you cannot find water or the water is not
enough for
wudoo
. Before making
tayammum
, you should try to get appropriate
water from any accessible place you can find it.  Only if you cannot find good water,
or it is too far away, can you make
tayammum
.
‘Imran bin Husain, one of the companions of Prophet
Muhammad said,
“We were with the Messenger of Allah during a journey.  When
he led the people in prayer, one man stayed apart.  He asked him, “What
prevented you from praying?”  He said, ‘I need a purifying bath and there is not
sufficient water.’  He said, ‘Use the soil, for it is sufficient.’’’
[3]
(2)  Injury or illness.
You may perform
tayammum
if you think using water
will worsen your disease based on past experience or the doctor’s advice. A
person hospitalized who is unable to make
wudoo
, may keep a bag with
some clean soil to make
tayammum
.
(3)  If the water is harmful to you because it is too
cold and for some reason you cannot heat it up.
‘Amr ibn al-’Aas narrated that he was participating in
an expedition.  He had a wet dream during an extremely cold night, and was
afraid that if he performed
ghusl
he would die.  He prayed the morning
prayer with his companions.  He then went to the Messenger of Allah to ask him
about this.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said,
“O ‘Amr, did you pray with your companions while you needed a purifying
bath?”
‘Amr mentioned the verse,
“Do not kill yourselves, Allah is
merciful to you”
to the Prophet.  The Prophet just smiled and didn’t say
anything.
[4]
(4)  If the water is nearby, but you cannot reach
it due to fear.
(5)  If you have water, but you need it for
cooking, or are saving it for use later.  For example, this may arise while
camping.  Many of the companions would save their drinking water and performed
tayammum
.
(6)  If you fear the time for
salah
(ritual
prayer) will be over by the time you get to water.
How to Perform
Tayammum
1.    You must have the intention of purifying yourself
and removing impurity.  The intention is in the heart and is not uttered.
2.    Say ‘
Bismillah
’ (I begin with the name
of Allah).
3.    Gently touch the ground or a dusty surface
with the palms of both hands.
4.    Blow on the hands and shake off any access,
so as not to make the face dusty.
5.    Wipe the palms together, then the face, and then
the palms and backs of the hands up to the wrists.
Ammar, Prophet’s companion, said, “We became sexually
impure and had no water, so we rolled in the dirt as does an animal and prayed.” 
This was mentioned to the Prophet and he said:
“This would"

Meaning
The Arabic word for prostration is ‘
sajdah
.’ It means to put
one’s head, hands, knees, and toes on the ground. The two
sajdahs
made
at the end of
salah
to make up for major errors are known as the
‘prostration of forgetfulness’ or
sajdah as-sahw
in Arabic.
Importance
We human beings are forgetful by nature and even forget
when we are praying to Allah. Our Creator is well aware of that fact and He
made His Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, forget on
some occasions in the prayer. This way the Prophet showed us how to correct our
mistakes in the prayer. Making up for our mistakes in prayer is a great mercy
from Allah because He could have made us repeat the prayer for every mistake,
but He did not.
When Are Prostrations of Forgetfulness Required?
They are two occasions when they
are required:
I.When
you add or subtract to the acts of
salah
.
Examples of addition:
You pray 5
rakahs
instead of 4.
You do three
prostrations instead of two.
You make
tashahhud
at the end of first
rakah.
Example of subtraction:
You pray 3
rakahs
instead of 4.
You do one
sajdah
instead of two.
You get up for the third
rakah
without doing the first
tashahhud.
II.When
you forget the number of
rakahs
and are in doubt, (for example) whether
you prayed three of four
rakahs
.
Missing a
Rukn
(Essential Component or Pillar of
Salah
)
If you omit the
Takbiratul-Ihram
, then there is
no prayer for you, regardless of whether you left it intentionally or due to
forgetfulness, because you never started the prayer.
If you omit a
rukn
other than the
Takbiratul-Ihram
deliberately, your
salah
is invalid.
If you left a
rukn
out of forgetfulness and you
reached the next
rakah
, then the
rakah
in which you left the
rukn
is invalid and the following
rakah
takes its place.
If you did not reach the next
rakah
, you must
return to the
rukn
you omitted and perform it and follow it by what
comes after it in the course of the
salah
.
In both of the above situations, you offer the “prostration
of forgetfulness”.
Missing a
Wajib
(Obligatory act of
salah
)
If you leave out something
wajib
unintentionally,
like the first
tashahhud
or a prostration, you simply do
sajdah
as-sahw
at the conclusion of prayer.  However, it is left intentionally,
then the prayer is invalid.
Missing a Recommended Act in Prayer
You do not have to make the “prostration of
forgetfulness” if you forget to perform one of the recommended acts of prayer.
Method of
Sajdah as-sahw
You have a choice between two
ways of doing it:
1.    Immediately
before
tasleem
at
the end of
salah.
Before concluding the prayer with
tasleem
, you
say
Allahu Akbar
, and then make the first prostration.
In the prostration you say,
Subha-na Rabbi al-A
'la
three times. Then you say
Allahu Akbar
and return to the sitting
position.
Then you say
Allahu Akbar
again and make the
second prostration and say the same words as you did in the first prostration.
You then say
Allahu Akbar
for the last time,
return to the sitting position, and turn your head to the right and then to the
left, saying each time “
As-Salamu
'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah
.”
2.    Doing it
after
tasleem.
Another way is to continue your
salah
and end it
with
tasleem
as you normally would.
After that you say
Allahu Akbar
and prostrate for
your first prostration, and say
Subha-na Rabbi al-A
'la
three
times. Then you say
Allahu Akbar
and return to the sitting position.
Then you say
Allahu Akbar
again and do your
second prostration and say
Subha-na Rabbi al-A
'la
three times.
Finally, you say
Allahu Akbar
the last time and
return to the sitting position, and then turn your face to the right saying “
As-Salamu
'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah
.”
Further Notes/Examples
1.    If you realize before making
tasleem
that you have added anything to the
salah
, for example an extra
rakah
,
you may do
sajdah as-sahw
before or after
tasleem
.

Something as mundane as
relieving oneself is tied to a Muslim’s sense of cleanliness and modesty.  There
is nothing odd or strange about it, as Islam literally is all encompassing,
something that evokes a pleasant surprise in some people.  Even in the time of
the Prophet, there was a polytheist who exclaimed with astonishment to Salman,
the Persian, “Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to
defecate
!”
 Salman responded, ‘“Yes, he forbade us to face the direction of Mecca
when urinating or defecating…”
[1]
In this lesson we will detail the
manners of relieving oneself, something apparently minor, but implies much about
personal hygiene and religious observance.
(A)   Supplications before Relieving
Oneself
There are certain supplications
one should recite when entering or leaving the place one relieves oneself,
whether it be in a bathroom or in nature.
(a)  One should say “
Bismillah
”
(I begin with the Name of Allah) before entering, because the Messenger of
Allah said:
“The eyes of the
jinn
are blocked from seeing the nakedness of the sons of Adam when one of them says
before entering the place for relieving oneself, ‘
Bismillah
.’” (
Al-Tirmidhi
)
(b)
Allah-humma
innee a’oodhu bika min al-khubuthi wa’l-kha-baa’ith
.
“O Allah, I seek refuge
with You from male and female devils.” (
Abu Daud
,
Al-Tirmidhi
)
Enter with your left foot.
(B)   Inside the Toilet
Facing the
Qibla
Out of respect a Muslim should
not face the
qiblah
[2]
when urinating or defecating.  The Messenger of Allah said:
“When any one of you sits
down to answer the call of nature, he should not face the
qiblah
or turn
his back towards it.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
Concealment
We must conceal ourselves from
the sight of others when answering the call of nature.  The Messenger of Allah
preferred to go behind a rise on the ground or a garden of date palms.
[3]
If a person is in the
open and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call
of nature, he should move away from public sight.  One of the Companions
described how he was with the Prophet on a journey, and when the Prophet felt
the need to answer the call of nature, he went far away.
[4]
When outdoors, one should not
uncover their private parts until they squat close to the ground, as it is more
concealing.
[5]
Indoors, first make sure you have closed the door and are out of sight.
(C)   Relieving Oneself
Squatting
Outdoors, it is best to answer
the call of nature sitting.  It is better to adopt a posture that is more
concealing, one which will cause no splash-back on yourself or your clothes.  If
there is a need and a person does not fear splash-back, it is permissible to
urinate standing up.
Splash-Back
One must take great care to avoid
the splash-back of urine, both on themselves and their clothes.  If urine or
stool soils some part of body or clothes, those areas must also be washed, and
the impurity must be totally removed from them.  The Messenger of Allah passed
by two graves, and said:
“Indeed they are being
punished, but for something which seemed trivial to them: this one used not to
guard himself from urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious
gossip.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Prohibited Places
Islam forbids urinating in
places where people might pass by, or seek shade therein, such a park, because it
is something disturbing to people.  The Prophet said, “
Fear the two things
that bring curses
.”  They asked, “What are the two things that bring
curses, O Messenger of Allah?”
He said:
“When a person relieves
himself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade.” (
Abu
Daud
)
Also, it is forbidden to urinate
in stagnant water, as it was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah.
[6]
It obviously makes the
water impure and will disturb those who use it.
Conversation
Don’t say, ‘
As-Salamu Alaikum’
to a person who is answering the call of nature, or reply with ‘
Wa Alaikum Assalam
’
while relieving yourself, out of respect for God’s name.
Al-Salaam
is one
of Allah’s beautiful Names.
A man passed by the Prophet while
he was urinating, and greeted him with
Salam
.  The Messenger of Allah
said to him:
“If you see me in this
state, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond.” (
Ibn Majah
)
It is disliked to speak while
relieving oneself unnecessarily.
Urinals
Urinals should be avoided for
four reasons.  First, there is no privacy.  Private parts are exposed, which is
indecent and forbidden.  Second, it is almost impossible to avoid splash-back. 
Third, there is no toilet paper. Fourth, people sometimes talk while urinating,
an activity better left outside the toilet!

What is
Khushoo
?
At one time or another you might hear someone say that they wish
they had more
khushoo
in their prayer.
Khushoo
can be translated
as humility and devotion in prayer.  It is the state of mind that allows you to
transcend the everyday worries that flitter in and out of your mind disrupting
your focus in prayer.  We all need a little more
khushoo
, some of us
more than others, but even the greatest and most devoted of us will at times
complain about their lack of
khushoo
.
Khushoo
in prayer means concentration, humility and submission.  It means
wholeheartedly fighting off any distractions or
waswaas
that enters our
minds when we should be entirely focused on worshipping Allah.  One of
Shaytan’s
most significant plots is to disrupt the prayer.  By doing this he achieves two
goals; he robs people from the joy of worshipping Allah and at the same time
makes them lose part or all of the reward.  One of the
sahabah
tells us
that Prophet Muhammad said, “The first thing you will lose of your religion is
khushoo
and the last thing you will lose of your religion is the
salah…”
[1]
“Successful indeed are the believers.  Those
who offer their
salah
with all solemnity and full submissiveness.”
(Quran 23:1-2)
We can say that we have achieved
khushoo
when a person is able to empty his heart and mind for prayer and focus on it to
the exclusion of all else and prefers to be praying rather than anything else. 
We all know that this can be very difficult especially when we are plagued by
the
waswaas
of
Shaytan
.
When a person stands with the intention
to pray the
Shaytan
feels jealous and begins an assault that is designed
to ruin the prayer.  He will distract the believer by all means possible, he
annoys him by whispering.  Did you make your ablution properly; did you leave
the stove on?  He will even use matters of the
deen
making you think
about anything other than the prayer.
Eight easy ways for gaining and maintaining
khushoo
.
1)Prepare for prayer properly.  You can do this
by repeating the words of the
adhan
and making
du’a
.  Paying
attention to your ablution and all the time remembering Allah
.
Also
making sure that your clothes and place of prayer are clean and tidy.  Allah is
of course the most deserving of our clean attire and surroundings.
2)Move calmly to the place of prayer and also during
the prayer.  Do not move through the positions of prayer like a chicken pecking
at the ground.  Haste prevents
khushoo
.
3)Remember death and what awaits us after death. 
Prophet Muhammad said, “Remember death in your prayer, for the man who
remembers death is bound to pray properly and pray the prayer of a man who does
not think that he will prayer any other prayer”.
[2]
4)Think about the words of the prayer and the
recited verses of the Quran.  The Quran was revealed to be pondered over.  It
would be helpful to read a
tafseer
.  Pause at the end of each
ayah
and even interact with the words.  For instance when Prophet Muhammad recited
an ayah that mentioned glorification he said
SubhanAllah
, if the
ayah
mentioned seeking refugee with Allah he would seek refuge with Allah.
[3]
5)Recite in a slow rhythmic tone and try to
beautify your voice.  Allah says in Quran,
“…And recite the Quran in a slow
pleasant style.” (Quran 73:4)
A slow measured pace is more conducive to
reflection.
6)Keep in mind that Allah responds to prayers.  Prayer
is a connection and con"

Introduction
There are special regulations in Islam
legislated for women regarding the three types of bleeding they experience,
that are menses, postpartum bleeding, and abnormal bleeding. Women must understand
the rulings pertinent to each type, as they deal with important aspects of
worship, such as purification, prayer and fasting. This lesson will try to
explain the most important rulings relevant to each type of bleeding.
Menstruation
Menstruation is the release of blood
and tissue through the vagina that occurs on a monthly cycle, not due to
specific events such as birth or breakage of the hymen.  Menstrual periods
usually occur once a month and last for several days.  Blood loss due to
menstrual flow may vary from month to month.  Women typically use sanitary
napkins (pads) or tampons to absorb menstrual flow. Menstrual blood is almost
always dark color and not bright.
Post-Childbirth bleeding
Such bleeding
occurs after the event of birth or miscarriage.  It has no minimum duration,
but it may even last up to forty days.  Umm Salamah said:
“During the lifetime of the
Prophet, the post-childbirth woman would seclude herself for forty days.”
(al-Bukhari)
A woman experiencing post-childbirth
bleeding has to stop praying for forty days unless her bleeding stops before
that.  If her bleeding stops before that time, she is to perform
ghusl
(ritual
bath) and start praying.  If she sees blood after forty days, most scholars say
that she is not to stop praying. The blood of postpartum bleeding is also
almost always dark.
Forbidden Acts
Divine wisdom has exempted women from
certain religious duties due to various reasons associated with bleeding.  The
following is a list of acts which are forbidden during menstruation and post-childbirth
bleeding:
(1)      Formal Prayer (
Salah
)
A woman experiencing her period or
post-childbirth bleeding is not to perform her prayers, whether obligatory or
voluntary, and those prayers which are missed due to this reason are not to be
made up at a later time.
If her blood flow starts after the time
for a certain prayer begins, for example, half an hour after the time for
Dhuhr
prayer, then, after her bleeding ends, she should make up that
Dhuhr
prayer,
since she was pure when the prayer became obligatory upon her. She should not,
however, make up the prayers she missed while she is bleeding.
[1]
If  there is enough time left to pray
at least one
rakah
(unit of prayer) after performing the ritual bath, she
should pray that prayer, because the Prophet said:
“Whoever catches with one unit of
prayer (
rakah
) before the sun rises has caught the
Fajr
prayer,
and whoever catches with one
rakah
before the sun sets has caught the
Asr
prayer.” (
Saheeh al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Example: if she performs the ritual
bath after the completion of her bleeding at the time of
Asr
and there
is enough time left before sunset for her to pray one
rakah
, then she
should pray
Asr
.
(2)      Fasting
It is forbidden for a woman experiencing
menstruation or postpartum bleeding to fast, whether it be for
Ramadan
or
voluntarily, but unlike the formal prayers she must make up the missed days of
Ramadan
.
(3)      Sexual intercourse
It is forbidden to have sexual
intercourse while a women is menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding,
although other types of intimacy are allowed.  As for anal intercourse, it is
forbidden at all times.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, was asked “What is it permissible for me to do with my wife when she
is menstruating?”  He said:
“Do as you wish except for sexual
intercourse.”
(Muslim)
(4)     Touching a copy of the Quran
It is forbidden to touch a copy of the Quran
when one is in any state of impurity, because Allah says:
“… which none can touch except the purified.”
(Quran 56:79)
The Prophet told the people of Yemen:
“No one should touch the Quran
except one who is pure.” (
Malik
,
an-Nasa’i
,
Ibn Hibbaan
,
al-Bayhaqi
)
Permissible Acts
(1)  reciting the Quran from
memory.
(2)
Du’a
(supplication).
(3)  engaging in
adhkar
: remembering
Allah with specific words like
Subhan-Allah
,
Allahu Akbar
, and
others.
(4)  reading books of hadeeth or
any other Islamic books.
One should keep in mind that it is
permissible to read and touch a translation of the Quran, as it is not the word
of Allah but rather a"

What is
Istikharah
?
Istikharah
is a
du’a
made in conjunction with
non-obligatory prayer; it is a voluntaryprayer that Prophet Mohammad recommended
to anybody wanting to do something but feeling hesitant about doing it.  It is
seeking guidance in order to make the right decision.  It is reported that Prophet
Muhammad would teach his companions to make
Istikharah
just as he would
teach them verses from the Quran.  One should pray two units of non-obligatory
(voluntary) prayer and then say the
du'a
of
Istikharah
.

“O Allah, I ask
You to show me what is best, through Your knowledge, and I ask You to empower
me, through Your power, and I beg You to grant me Your tremendous favour, for
You have power, while I am without power, and You have knowledge, while I am
without knowledge, and You are the One who knows all things unseen.
O Allah, if You
know that this matter (mention the thing to be decided) is good for me in my
religion and in my life and for my welfare in the life to come, then ordain it
for me and make it easy for me, and then bless me in it.
And if You know
that this matter is bad for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare
in the life to come, then distance it from me, and distance me from it, and
ordain for me what is good wherever it may be, and help me to be content with
it.”
When to recite the
du’a
of
Istikharah
It is permitted to recite the
du’a
of
Istikharah
either before or after the
tasleem.
Some scholars recommend before,
because Prophet Muhammad himself used to make a lot of
du’a
before the
tasleem
.
When to pray
Istikharah
Islamic scholars agree that
Istikharah
is suggested
when a person does not know the right decision to make.  If one is unsure about
whether or not his possible actions would bring about good in both this world
and the hereafter.  If a person is hesitating, not knowing if “it” is the right
thing to do then
Istikharah
is the
du’a
that may set his mind at
ease.  It is the
du’a
that acknowledges Allah as the only strength and
only power in this world.  His guidance is necessary to ensure that human
beings follow the straight and correct path that leads to a blissful life
everlasting.   For instance, if a person wants to
find out the right time
to do something, such as whether or
not to do voluntary
Hajj
this year
,
or to propose marriage to a
particular person, then it is acceptable and recommended that he or she prays
Istikharah.
Understand carefully that
Istikharah
is for matters that are
considered either recommended or permissible.  It is for cases in which there
is a conflict.  Should I give to this charity or the other? Should I apply for
this
halal
job or another? One shouldprays
Istikharah
concerning
the thing he or she thinks is more likely to be better and then go ahead with
doing it.
Istikharah
is not prayed for matters that are
considered obligatory acts of worship, or for staying away from sins and evil
actions.
It is recommended, before praying
Istikharah
, to
consult someone whom you know is sincere, caring and has experience, and who is
trustworthy with regard to his or her religious commitment and knowledge.
Common Mistakes
·
Believing that there is a set number of
times to pray
Istikharah
.
There is no set time period for praying
Istikharah
and it is permissible to repeat it more than once.
·
Believing in the need for a dream.
Some people believe that after praying
Istikharah
they should experience a dream or feeling of ease.  This is not correct.   Even
without such a thing, if a person makes a decision it should be hoped, due to
the sincere
du’a
of
Istikharah
, that this will be the best decision.

Arabic Terms:
·
Du’a
: Supplication, prayer, asking
Allah for something.
·
Shirk
: A word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
·
Halal
: Permissible
·
Taqwa
: Linguistically it means “to
protect” or “to shield”, as in to protect oneself from wrongdoing. In Islam,
Taqwa refers to consciousness of Allah. It describes a state of awareness of
Allah in everything you do.
·
Aameen
: An expression said at the end
of making a supplication, meaning ‘O Allah, please accept.’
·
Qiblah
: The direction one faces
during the formal prayers.
The Arabic word “
du’a”
means to ask your
Lord for His help and support. It can be translated as supplication or prayer. It
is a
form of worship
because Allah orders us to make
du’a
to Him:
“And your Lord says, ‘Make
du’a
to Me, and I will
answer you!’” (Quran 40:60)
Since
du’a
is an act of worship, the way it is
made, the procedure to be followed, and the manner to be observed when
performing this worship must be from the Quran and
Sunnah
.
Du’a
is closely related to one’s faith. One, it
is an open declaration that you believe in Allah and Allah alone. Two, it makes
you feel that you are not in control of your life, Allah is. This is why you
are going to Him and begging Him for your needs. Three, it reminds you that Allah
truly hears your
du’a
and will respond to it.
Since
du’a
is an act of worship, making
du’a
to someone other than Allah is an act of
Shirk
.
Du’a
can only be
directed to Allah and Allah alone. One verse from the Quran is sufficient to
illustrate this point:
“Say (O Muhammad), ‘I make
du’a
only to my Lord
(Allah), and I associate none as partners along with Him.’” (Quran 72:20)
Suppose a person makes
du’a
to other than Allah,
be it an idol or a saint, while believing that that being can hear him like
Allah, and can answer his
du’a
, then doing so is equating that object or
person with Allah. That is precisely
shirk
.
Benefits of
Du’a
:
1.
Du’a
is one of the noblest acts in the sight of Allah.
2.
Du’a
is the essence of worship.
3.
Du’a
is a sign of one’s faith.
4.Making
du’a
is obeying Allah.
5.Allah is close to the person who makes
du’a.
6.Through
du’a
Allah shows His generosity to us.
7.
Du’a
is a sign of humility.
8.
Du’a
repels Allah’s anger.
9.
Du’a
can save one from the Fire of Hell.
10.Making
du’a
shows having knowledge of the Almighty.
11.Allah loves
du’a.
12.
Du’a
sets
apart a believer from a non-believer.
13.
Du’a
is the weapon of the believer and those who have been wronged.
14.
Du’a
is a means of communicating with the Creator.
15.
Du’a
is an easy act of worship.
Before You make
Du’a
1.Realize that only Allah responds to
du’a
“Who else is there that responds to the call of the one in
distress when he makes
du’a
, and He removes evil from him, and makes you
inheritors of the earth? Is there any other god besides Allah? Little is that
you remember!” (Quran 27:62)
2.Be sincere towards Allah when making
du’a
“And those who you make
du’a
to (ask) besides Him can
neither come to your aid nor can they help themselves.” (Quran 7:197)
3.Don’t be hasty when making
du’a
The Prophet said, “
The slave will receive
a response so long as his
du’a
does not involve sin or severing of
family ties, and so long as he is not hasty.” It was said, “What does being
hasty mean?” He said: “When he says, ‘I made
du’a
and I made
du’a
,
and I have not seen any response,’ and he gets frustrated and stops making
du’a
.”
[1]
4.Make
du’a
for good things
Allah likes His slaves to ask Him for
everything that is in their spiritual and worldly benefit such as food, drink,
clothing, guidance and forgiveness etc. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Let
one of you ask his Lord for what he needs, even asking Him for the lace of his
shoe if it breaks.”
[2]
5.Make
du’a
with an attentive heart
Concentrate on making
du’a
,
focus on what you are asking Allah, put your mind and heart into it. Think of
what Prophet Muhammad said,
“Make
du’a
to Allah in a state that you
are certain that your
du’a
will be responded to, and know that Allah
does not answer a
du’a
from a heedless, inattentive heart.”
[3]
6.Earn your livelihood from an Islamically permissible source and
eat
halal
food
Selling alcohol and pork, gambling, theft,
and accepting bribes are all examples of impermissible sources of income. It
states in the Quran:
“Allah only accepts (deeds) from those who have
Taqwa
(who fear Him).” (Quran 5:27)
While Making
Du’a
1.Praise Allah before the
du’a
and send prayers on the
Prophet
The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)
saw someone make
du’a
. The Prophet instructed that person,“
…when you
finish your formal prayer, then sit down and praise Allah with the pr"

·Learn the matters that one should avoid when
supplicating to Allah.
·Identify the times when it is preferred to
make
du’a
.
Arabic Terms:
·
Adhan
- An Islamic way of calling
Muslims to the five obligatory Prayers.
·
Hajj
– A pilgrimage to Mecca where the pilgrim performs a
set of rituals.  The
Hajj
is one of the five pillars of Islam, which every
adult Muslim must undertake at least once in their life if they can afford it
and are physically able.
·
Iqama
- The second call to prayer. It
is similar to the
Adhan
and is said right before the prayer starts.
·
Dhul-Hijjah
- The twelfth month of
the Islamic calendar. It is the month in which the obligatory pilgrimage is performed.
·
Ramadan
- The ninth month of the
Islamic lunar calendar.  It is the month in which the obligatory fasting has
been prescribed.
Things to Avoid While Making
Du’a
1.Don’t go beyond limits
What it means is asking Allah for things He has
forbidden. For example, while it is fine to pray to Allah to marry someone, it
is forbidden to ask Allah to give you a girl friend or a boy friend, or to win
a lottery.
2.Not expecting an answer
A Muslim should hope that Allah will answer His
du’a
as Allah is Merciful to His slaves and powerful to grant them their wishes.
3.To ask for things of this world only in
du’a
Think about it, what is greater, this world or the
hereafter? For a true believer, it is obvious that what Allah has prepared in
the life to come is greater. Therefore, a Muslim who understands this point
will ask Allah for the blessings of the Hereafter as well.
4.To address Allah with improper Names
Remember this simple rule: do not address Allah or use
any Name of Allah that is not from the Quran or
Sunnah
. Addressing Allah
with words like “Big Guy.”
5.Do not make
du’a
against yourself or your family and do
not curse others.
A point to remember, as a person may pray against a
family member or even himself in a fit of rage and start cursing.
6.Do not pray for your death
Your life is Allah’s gift to you, do not ask Allah to
take it away!
Preferred Times When
Du’a
Is Likely to Be Accepted
Du’a
can be made at any time, but it is more
likely to be accepted at the following times:
1.
Du’a
in the last third of the night
Allah informs us in the Quran describing the believers,
“and they seek forgiveness from their Lord in the hours of the
dawn.” (Quran 51:18)
How do you calculate the last third of the night? The
night extends from the time of sunset till the time for Fajr begins. For
example, say sunset is at 5pm and Fajr for next day starts at 5am. The night is
12 hrs. A third of a night is 4 hrs. The last third of the night will be from
1am-5am.
2.
Du’a
when
Adhan
is called
The Prophet said, “
When the
Adhan
is called,
the doors of the skies are opened, and the
du’a
is answered.
” (
Saheeh
Muslim
)
3.
Du’a
Between
Adhan
&
Iqama
This is one of the best times for the prayer to be
accepted that is given to a believer to ask from Allah for his needs of this
world and the Hereafter.
4.
Du’a
while prostrating (kowtowing)
This is the best posture that a worshipper can be in
because it is the height of humility. Allah loves this posture the most. The
Prophet, may Allah praise him, said: “
The closest that a person is to his
Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of
du’a
then.
” (
Saheeh
Muslim
)
5.
Du’a
before the conclusion of formal prayer
Before concluding the formal prayers, by saying
‘As-Salamu
‘Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah’
a person can make any
du’a
that he likes at
this time as it is one of the times when prayers are responded to.
6.
Du’a
after the obligatory formal prayer
When asked which
du’a
is most likely to be
responded to, the Prophet said, “
In the last part of the night and after the
obligatory prayers.
” (
Tirmidhi
)
7.An hour on Friday
Prophet Muhammad said: “
On Friday there is an hour
when, if a Muslims happens to pray at that time and ask Allah for something
good, He will give it to him
” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
8.
Du’a
in Ramadan, the month of fasting
Prophet Muhammad said: “
When Ramadan comes, the doors
of mercy are opened and the doors of Hell are closed, and the devils are locked
up.
” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
9.First ten days of the Islamic month of Hajj (
Dhul-Hijjah
)
The Islamic month in which the annual pilgrimage, or
Hajj, is performed, is a blessed month. The Prophet said about the first ten
days of this month,
“There are no days during which good deeds are more
beloved to Allah than during these ten days.”
(
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
10.During rainfall
The Prophet said,
“Two are the
du’as
that are
never returned: the
du’a
made when the
Adhan
is called and at the
time of rainfall.”
(
Abu Daud
)"

A Muslim is required to wash his feet when making
wudoo
. 
In some circumstances Islamic law waives washing of the feet and allows a
Muslim to wipe over the socks.  This is called
masah
in Arabic.
Wiping Over Socks
The following three conditions must be met for wiping
over socks to be valid:
(1)  You should have worn the socks after washing
the foot in a previous
wudoo
or
ghusl
(ritual bath).
(2)  The sock must cover the whole foot including
the ankle.
(3)  You can only wipe on the sock within the time
period allowed to do so.
(4) You should not have taken off the sock after
breaking
wudoo
.
Time Period for Wiping Over Socks
If you are not traveling, you can wipe over your socks
for twenty-four hours.  If you are traveling, you may do so for three days; that
is seventy-two hours.  At the end of the period, you must take off your socks
and wash your feet for a new
wudoo
.
If you have
wudoo
at the end of twenty-four hours
or three days (if traveling), you are not required to renew
wudoo
until
you break it.  The 24-hr/72hr time begins when you first wipe over your socks. 
Acts that break regular
wudoo
are the same acts that break
wudoo
done with wiping.  For example, sleep would break your
wudoo
, but a wet
dream would require you take a bath (
ghusl
).  Wiping over socks is not
compulsory, even when traveling, and the rule applies to both, men and women.
Method
The method to be used when wiping over socks is to pass
wet hands over the top of the socks.  The sole of the sock is not wiped.  It
does not matter which hand you use to wipe each sock, but it is better to wipe
both simultaneously.
You may wipe over shoes which reach above the ankle as
well with the same conditions mentioned for socks. Like socks, you may not wipe
over the shoes if you remove them after having broken your
wudoo
,
rather, in this case, you will have to make
masah
over the socks
underneath them.
Making up Missed Prayers
Making up prayers missed intentionally or
unintentionally is called
qada’
in Arabic.  We will only discuss making
up the
salah
if you missed it unintentionally.  A person who misses a
salah
is responsible for performing it no matter how late he remembers it.  The
Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“If anyone misses a
salah
, he must pray it
when he remembers it.  There is no expiation except the
salah
itself.”
[1]
For example, if you remember at the time of
Asr
that you have missed
Dhuhr
, you should make up
Dhuhr
and then
pray
Asr
.
Method
If you sleep through a
salah
, meaning the time
for that prayer has passed and you have slept through it, you must make
wudoo
upon waking up and offer it.  One night, during a journey with the Prophet,
some people said, ‘If only the Prophet would take rest with us during the last
hours of the night.’  He replied,
‘I am afraid you will sleep and miss the
Fajr
salah
.’
Bilal said, ‘I will wake you up.’  They all went to sleep, but
Bilal also fell asleep!  The Prophet woke up when the sun began to rise and
said,
‘O Bilal, what happened to your statement?’
He replied, ‘I have
never slept so much!’  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said,
‘Allah took our souls when He wished and released them when
He wished.  O Bilal, get up and call the
Adhan
for prayer.’
The
Prophet then made
wudoo
and when the sun came up completely, he stood up
and prayed.
[2]
Prayer of the Traveler
Islamic law makes the
salah
easier for a traveler
in two ways:
By shortening prayers: the four
rakah
salah
is shortened to two
rakahs
.
By combining prayers:
Dhuhr
can be combined with
Asr
,
Maghrib
can be combined with
Isha
.  Prayers, however, cannot be
combined in any other way.
Fajr
cannot be combined with
Isha
,
Fajr
cannot be combined with
Dhuhr
.
Asr
can not be combined with
Maghrib
.
Conditions
Prayers can be shortened when one is traveling.  You cannot
shorten the prayers unless you have actually left your city limits.  There is
no time limit as to how long you can shorten the prayers.  The majority of
scholars allow it for up to four days and nights, though.  In case of bad weather,
prayers can be co"

The five most important and essential acts of worship in Islam
are simply known as the “pillars of Islam.”  They are the “
shahadah
”
(the testimony that no one deserves worship except Allah and Muhammad is the
Messenger of Allah), the five daily prayers,
zakah
, fasting, and the
hajj
pilgrimage.  A Muslim has to first and foremost focus on learning and
practicing these pillars before focusing on other aspects of Islam.
The word ‘
zakah
’ is usually translated as ‘poor
due’ or ‘alms tax.’  Actually, no single word can translate
zakah
properly.
Before the word
zakah
is explained, it is best
understood with another word, “
sadaqah
.”
Zakah
and
sadaqah
are different.
Zakah
is obligatory charity and is required, whereas
sadaqah
is voluntary
charity and is a recommended act that brings extra reward.  Moreover,
zakah
is the third pillar of Islam.  Not paying
zakah
out of negligence is a
sin, whereas a person is generally not sinful for not paying voluntary charity. 
That is why it is called “voluntary” charity!
Zakah
is calculated
precisely and can only be given to specific recipients, whereas
sadaqah
is not bound by such regulations.
Zakah
has to be given yearly, whereas
sadaqah
can be given only once or as frequently as one likes.
Spirituality of
Zakah
Zakah
is a beautiful act of worship that is
intimately tied to purification.  As a matter of fact, spending one’s wealth in
zakah
purifies the heart from the love of material wealth.  A person who
offers the gift of his wealth affirms the truth that to him nothing is dearer
than the love of Allah and he is prepared to sacrifice even his wealth to
please Allah.  The Prophet Muhammad said,
‘Whoever pays the
zakah
on his wealth will
have its evil removed from him.’
[1]
Exact Definition of
Zakah
In Islamic Law (
Shariah
), words are clearly
defined.
Zakah
is no exception.
Shariah
defines
zakah
to
be specific portion of one’s wealth that one must give yearly to a specific
group of recipients that are mentioned in the Quran.
Importance of
Zakah
& the Punishment for Not
Paying It
Zakah
represents the compassion of Islam towards
the poor and needy.
Zakah
is not a tax, but it is an act of worship for
which one receives reward from Allah.  Not paying the
zakah
is a sin.  Denying
its obligation is an act of disbelief.
The Quran tells us about the fate of those who refuse to
pay
zakah
.  It says,
“…And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it
in the way of Allah, warn them of a painful suffering (in the life to come).  On
that day when (the hoarded wealth) will be heated in the fire of Hell and with
it their foreheads, their sides, and their backs will be branded (and it will
be said to them), ‘This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves, so
taste what you used to hoard.’” (Quran 9:34-35)
What is
Nisaab
?
Zakah
is not to be paid unless the wealth reaches
a minimum level called “
nisaab
.” Think of
nisaab
as a scale to
help you determine if you are required to pay
zakah
.  Different forms of
wealth have different
nisaab
:
Silver 595gm
Gold 85gm,
3 US oz, or 2.74 troy oz of pure gold
Cash
& Savings      Equal to the value of 85 gm of gold or 595 gm of silver, whichever
works out to be less.
Zakah
on above items is 2.5% of their value.  If
the
nisaab
is met in any one form of wealth,
zakah
becomes
applicable only on that particular form of wealth and is calculated on the
total (
nisaab
plus excess) of that.
The prices of gold and silver vary everyday in
international markets.  For example, on August 15, 2012 the price of gold was approximately
$51.54/gm and for silver was $0.89/gm, hence the
nisaab
for gold was
approximately $4380.9 ($51.54 x 85 grams) and the
nisaab
for silver was
approximately $529.55 ($0.89 x 595 grams).  Gold and silver prices can be
obtained from www.goldprice.org
When is
Zakah
Due?
Many Islamic rules and regulations depend on the Islamic
lunar year.
Zakah
is one of them.  If you have had wealth more than the
nisaab
for one (lunar) year, then you just pay the
zakah
.  Though
not
required, but most people calculate their
zakah
Ramadan to
Ramadan.  You can fix to calculate and pay your
zakah
every 1
st
or 15
th
of Ramadan.
Example: Say you have $2000/- and 800 grams of gold f"

Zakah
on Stocks, Shares, & 401K
Zakah
is calculated at a standard rate of 2.5% of
total portfolio value at the
zakah
due date because they are bought with
expectation of profit, and readily traded for money.
Short-term traders should estimate stock values on an
established annual
zakah
due date, regardless of stock purchase dates or
value fluctuations, and pay 2.5% of total portfolio value.
It seems best to consider all accounts - 401(k), Keogh,
IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, etc.  - as zakatable at the rate of 2.5% annually.  Usually
not all the money is accessible to the investor for withdrawal, up to 50%
normally being allowed.  Therefore, the following formula is suggested by some
scholars:
Withdrawal Amount - Prescribed Penalty - Prescribed
Tax = Zakatable Amount
Who Can Receive
Zakah
?
The Quran tells us who is entitled to receive
zakah
. 
The eight categories are found in the Quran in Chapter at-Tawbah, 9:60:
1.  The Poor
Poor people who do not have sufficient money to meet
their needs are qualified to receive
zakah
.  It does not mean they are
penniless, but cannot make their ends meet, yet they do not ask others for help
out of modesty and a sense of self-respect.
2.  The Destitute
These are people who are so poor that they have nothing
to meet their needs.  Obviously, they are in worse condition than the first
category.
3.
Zakah
Administrators
People responsible for collecting and distributing
zakah
could be paid for their work from
zakah
funds.  They can receive wages
whether they are poor or not.
4.  Reconcile Hearts
People who have recently accepted Islam can be given
zakah
. 
People can also be given money from
zakah
to seek their support or to
prevent their opposition.
5.  Freeing Slaves
In the past,
zakah
money was also used to buy
slaves their freedom.  The Quran has legislated it to be one of the legitimate ways
to spend the money from
zakah
.  It is a clear expression of the
compassion of Islam towards treatment of slaves when they existed.  Islam
raised freeing slaves to an act of worship pleasing to God.  No other religion
has ever done that as far as this author is aware of.
6.  Paying Debts
People who are overburdened with debt and do not have a
way to pay on their own can also receive
zakah
funds.  The debt can be
due to medical reasons, marriage, or other lawful expenses.
7.  Cause of Allah
Wealth can also be spent in the cause of Allah.  The
traditional understanding held by the classical scholars of Islam is that this
category is reserved for jihad or a legitimate war.  Later scholars have
included efforts for the spread and ideological defense of Islam in this
category as well.
8.  Travelers
People used to get stranded in the past while traveling
with no access to their funds back home.  It happens sometimes today as well.  In
such situations, those travelers may be given money from
zakah
.  The
condition is that their journey should not be in disobedience of Allah, but for
an acceptable cause like seeking knowledge, looking for a job, or doing
business.
Who Can Not Receive
Zakah
?
A wealthy person cannot give
zakah
to his or her
parents because they are the child’s responsibility.  Also, a husband cannot
give
zakah
to his wife as she is his financial responsibility.  Furthermore,
a non-Muslim cannot be given
zakah
according to the majority of scholars. 
Poor non-Muslims can be helped with
sadaqah
or voluntary charity.
Practical Tips on Giving
Zakah
1.    You can give money to a poor and needy
Muslims directly if you know them.
2.    Your local Islamic center most likely
collects
zakah
and distributes it to the needy of the local community or
works with a charitable organization.  Therefore, you can always ask the local
mosque if they accept
zakah
.  You might even find boxes labeled “
zakah
”
in the mosque in which you can simply drop your check or cash for
zakah
.
3.    Furthermore, you can search online and find
numerous Islamic charitable organization that collect
zakah
to sponsor
orphans or distribute food or medicine in disaster-struck areas.
The following are just some of the organizations you can
give your
zakah
to:
www.zakat.org
www.islamic-relief.com
www.hhrd.org
Miscellaneous Issues
Zakah
is to be paid on gold and silver jewelry.  The
zakah
on the gold will be calculated according to the gold content in
the jewelry (i.e.  karats) and its value in the market.  Hence when calculating
the value of your gold, you must consult a jeweler for the correct value (based
on the content and weight).  Any stones in the jewelry are not subject to
zakah
.
You must have the intention to pay
zakah
when you
give it out.  In other words,"

The first thing to understand is the difference between
what is known as
fard
and what is known as
nafl
.
Fard
is
obligatory, it is what Allah requires us to do, and leaving it is a sin and we
will be held accountable for it.  An example is two
rakah
of
Fajr
prayer and the fasts of
Ramadan
.
Nafl
literally means extra.
Nafl
worship
is voluntary, it is not required from a Muslim, rather it is up to the
individual to offer it.  It is optional and voluntary.  The Muslim is not
sinful for neglecting
nafl
, but is rewarded for doing it.  Therefore,
nafl
worship is recommended.  Examples of
nafl
fasts will be covered in this
lesson.
Many times a new Muslim is anxious about fasting the
whole month of
Ramadan
(9
th
Islamic month).  Voluntary fasts
provide an excellent opportunity to practice fasting while earning rewards
before
Ramadan
approaches.  At the same time, one must remember not to
burn out, but to be gradual without being negligent.
The Most Important
Nafl
Fasts
1.       Six Days in the Month of
Shawwal
(the month following
Ramadan
or the 10
th
Islamic month)
The Prophet said,
“Whoever fasts during the month of
Ramadan
and then follows it with six days of
Shawwal
will be (rewarded) as if he
had fasted the entire year.”
[1]
It is forbidden to fast on the day of
Eid
or
Eid-ul-Fitr
to be specific.  You can keep these six fasts anytime after the day of
Eid
and
they do not have to be kept consecutively.   If you wish you can fast them separately
as long as they are completed within the month of
Shawwal
.
2.       Fasting the Ninth Day of
Dhul-Hijjah
(12
th
Islamic month)
The Islamic month in which the
Hajj
is performed
is known as
Dhul-Hijjah
.
Yaum ul-Arafah
or the “Day of Arafah”
is the ninth day of that month.
It is recommended for those not performing the
Hajj
pilgrimage to fast this day as the Messenger of Allah said:
“Fasting on the
day of Arafah is an expiation for two years, the year preceding it and the year
following it.”
[2]
3.       Fasting the Tenth Day of the Islamic Month of
Muharram
(1
st
Islamic month)
Muharram
is the first month of the Islamic lunar
calendar.  The tenth day of this month has a special name – “
Ashura
.”
What does one get for fasting it? The Prophet informed us,
“Fasting the day of
Ashura
is an expiation
for the past year.”
[3]
4.       Fasting Mondays and Thursdays
Abu Hurairah, the close companion of Prophet Muhammad,
reported that the Prophet would fast on Mondays and Thursdays.  When asked
about that, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said:
“The actions are presented on every Monday and Thursday.  Allah
forgives every Muslim or every believer, except for those who are boycotting
each other.  He says (about them): ‘Leave them.’”
[4]
When the Prophet
was asked about fasting on Mondays, he said
: “That is the day on which I
was born and the day on which I received revelation.”
[5]
5.       Fasting most of the month of Sha’ban (8
th
Islamic month)
Sha’ban
is the name of the Islamic month that
comes before
Ramadan
.  The Prophet would fast most of the month of
Sha’ban
.
‘Aisha, the wife
of the Prophet, said:
“I never saw the Messenger of Allah fast a
complete month except for
Ramadan
, and I have never seen him fast more
in a month than he did in
Sha’ban
.”

Preview of Fasting
Fasting is not unique to
Muslims. It has been practiced for centuries in connection with religious
ceremonies by Christians, Jews, Confucians, Hindus, Taoists, Jains, and others
as Allah says:
“O you who believe, fasting is
prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may
become righteous.” (Quran 2:183)
But like other rituals fasting
was also altered and corrupted.
Fasting in Primitive Societies
Fasting was made part of the
fertility rites in primitive ceremonies which were held at the vernal and
autumnal equinoxes and survived for centuries.  Some primitive societies fasted
to avert catastrophe or to serve as penance for sin.  Native North Americans
held tribal fasts to avert threatening disasters.  The Native Americans of
Mexico and the Incas of Peru observed penitential fasts to appease their gods. Past
nations of the Old World, such as the Assyrians and the Babylonians, observed
fasting as a form of penance.
Fasting in Judaism and Christianity
Jews observe fasting as a form
of penitence and purification annually on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur,
which corresponds to the tenth of Muharram (
‘Ashura
) of the Islamic
calendar.  On this day neither food nor drink is permitted.
Early Christians associated
fasting with penitence and purification. During the first two centuries of its
existence, the Christian Church established fasting as a voluntary preparation
for receiving the sacraments of Holy Communion and baptism and for the
ordination of priests. Later, these fasts were made obligatory, as other days
were subsequently added.  In the 6th century the Lenten fast was expanded to 40
days, on each of which only one meal was permitted.  After the Reformation,
fasting was retained by most Protestant Churches and was made optional in some
cases. Stricter Protestants like the Puritans, however, condemned not only the
festivals of the Church, but its traditional fasts as well.
In the Roman Catholic Church, fasting
may involve partial abstinence from food and drink or total abstinence.  The Roman
Catholic days of fasting are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
In the United
  States, fasting is observed mostly by Episcopalians and Lutherans among
Protestants, by Orthodox and Conservative Jews, and by Roman Catholics.
Secular Fasting: The Hunger Strike
From being an empty ritual,
fasting went to another extreme in the West: the hunger strike, a form of
fasting, which in modern times has become a political weapon after being
popularized by Mohandas Gandhi, leader of Indian struggle for freedom, who
undertook fasts to compel his followers to obey his precept of nonviolence.
Fasting in Islam
Islam has prescribed and
retained the ritual of fasting throughout centuries as a means for purifying
the soul of a man in order to draw near to his Creator by selfish motives and base
desires of self.  It has a special status among all the devotional worships
because it is difficult to perform.  It puts a bridle on the most uncontrolled,
savage human emotions.  The most unruly human emotions are pride, avarice,
gluttony, lust, envy, and anger.  These emotions, by their nature are not easy
to control, thus a person must strive hard to discipline them.  Fasting helps
do that.
The Islamic calendar consists
of twelve lunar months. Muslims measure their year by the cycles of the moon
rather than the sun, so the Muslim lunar year is eleven days shorter than the
Christian solar year. Muslims are forbidden to adjust their year by adding an
extra month, as the Jews do to keep their lunar calendar in synch with the
seasons.  Hence, the months of the Muslim year do not relate to the seasons. 
Each month lasts 29 or 30 days and occurs during different seasons of the
year.  A new month begins when the evening new moon is sighted.  The ninth
month is called
Ramadan
and is dedicated to fasting.  It is pronounced
Ramazan
by Indo-Pakistanis.
Below we list the virtues and
rewards of this month and fasting in general.  In the next lesson we will learn
how to fast.  In the third and final installment, we will discuss the social
aspects of
Ramadan
.  In the fourth and last lesson, we will learn about
the end of month activities.

Types of Fasting
First thing to know is that fasting is of two
types: obligatory and voluntary.  Obligatory fasts are required worship - as a
Muslim I do not have the option to leave it without incurring sin.  Voluntary
fasts are optional - I may keep them or not. If I don’t, I won’t incur any sin,
but I will get extra reward for keeping them.  In this lesson we will focus
only on the most important obligatory fasts that are kept in the month of
Ramadan
.
Fasting In
Ramadan
Fasting in
Ramadan
is one of the five
pillars of Islam as the Prophet said:
“Islam is built on five pillars: testifying
that there is no true god except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, the
establishment of the prayer, the giving of
zakah
, the fast of
Ramadan
,
and the pilgrimage to Mecca.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Fasting in
Ramadan
is an obligation on every
Muslim who has reached the age of puberty.  Allah said in the Quran:
“So whoever witnesses the month should fast it.” (Quran
2:185)
Whoever does not fast
during
Ramadan
without a legitimate excuse commits what is considered
a major sin.
Who is Exempt from Fasting?
(1)  A Muslim child who has
not yet
reached puberty
is exempt from fasting till
one
of the following
signs of puberty appear:
(a) discharge of semen, whether by
experiencing a wet dream or otherwise
(b) growth of pubic hair
(c) menstruation
(d) a person has turned 15
(2)  If you are
traveling
in
Ramadan
,
you have the option not to fast. If you choose not to, you must make up for the
days missed at a later time before the following
Ramadan
.
(3)  A woman is not allowed to fast during
menstruation or post-natal bleeding, and she must perform the number of fasts
she missed on other days before the following
Ramadan
.
(4)  A
pregnant
or
breast-feeding
woman may be exempted from fasting if it proves harmful to her or the infant.  This
case is discussed in more detail below.
(5)  The
mentally insane
are also
exempt from fasting.
(6)  The Merciful Lord does not burden a
soul beyond its ability.  If you are
sick
, you are also exempt from
fasting.
There are two issues to know here:
First, how sick is sick?  Cough or minor
headache is not serious enough not to fast, but if there is medical reason, and
you know from experience, or are certain that fasting will make your illness
worse or delay recovery, you do not need to fast.
Second, you should make up the days when
you get better.
The chronically ill who do not foresee any chance
of recovery must feed a poor person for every day of
Ramadan
they miss.
They do not need to fast for them on other days.
(8)  Those
too old
to fast are also
exempt from fasting, and they too must feed a poor person for every day of
Ramadan
they miss.
How Do I Fast in
Ramadan
?
First, check with your local mosque for the beginning
of
Ramadan
by calling or visiting them.  Usually, mosques print a
special schedule for
Ramadan
that will tell you the times for starting
and ending the fast (the time of
Fajr
and
Maghrib
, respectively) and
maybe even the time for the
Taraweeh
prayer.
Second, intend in your heart the night before
that you will fast the next day based on what the Prophet, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“There is no fast for the person who did
not intend to fast from the night before.” (
An-Nasa’i
)
The idea is to remind yourself that one is
fasting for the pleasure of our Creator.

- fast-breaking

Your Islamic center will announce the end of
Ramadan
and the celebration of
Eid
.  The first day of the month following
Ramadan
is
Eid ul-Fitr
, the celebration of fast-breaking.  Very likely, in the
last few days of
Ramadan
, your mosque will also start collecting obligatory
post-
Ramadan
food (or money) due for the poor Muslims called
Zakat ul-Fitr
(Fast-breaking obligatory charity).
Zakat ul-Fitr
One of the companions of the Prophet said,
""Messenger of Allah made
Zakat ul-Fitr
obligatory to purify the fasting person from indecent words or actions, and to
provide food for the needy.  It is accepted as
Zakat
for the person who
gives it before the
Eid
prayer, but it is mere charity (like any other) for
the one who gives it after the prayer.""
[1]
We learn three matters regarding
Zakat ul-Fitr
:
(a)  It purifies the person who fasted
Ramadan
and cleanses him of indecent talk and minor sins performed during
Ramadan
.
(b)  This
Eid
is a day of eating and
drinking, as the month prior to it was one of fasting.
Zakat ul-Fitr
ensures that even the poorest of Muslims will partake in this outward show of
festivity.
(c)  Paying
Zakat ul-Fitr
is required
of every Muslim capable of giving for himself and on behalf of every family member
under his care.
The Quantity of Food
The quantity of food to be given out per person is
roughly equal to four handfuls of the two hands held together.  Its weight will
be different for different foodstuffs.  It is allowed to give money to a
charity organization or mosque so that they buy the foodstuff and distribute it
to the poor on your behalf, and that is why many mosques will offer to collect its
dollar equivalent from you instead.  You also have the option of giving the
food stuff to the mosque or charity organization, paying them to take care of
distributing
Zakat ul-Fitr
on your behalf, or you can give it out on
your own.
The Type of Food
The staple food of the people in your area may
be given.  Dates, barley, wheat, olives, raisins, wheat, and dried yogurt used
to be commonly eaten food in the time of the Prophet.  Today, pasta, rice,
beans, potatoes, cheese, and similar foods are more common.
The Best Time to Give It
The best time for it to be given out starts from
the eve of
Eid
until right before going to the prayer.
Permissible Time to Give It
You may offer it one or two days before
Eid
.
Delaying it after
Eid
Prayer
It is a sin to delay it after
Eid
prayer.
Who to Give It To?
It is given to a fellow Muslim with limited
financial means, but not necessarily in complete poverty.
Eid ul-Fitr
“
Eid
” means a day of social gathering.  In
Islam there are only three festivals:
(a)  The yearly
Eid ul-Fitr
(b)  The yearly
Eid ul-Adha
(c)  The weekly Friday.
Eid ul-Fitr
is a major festivity for the
Muslims, a time for gratitude to Allah, family bonding, fun, and merriment.  On
this day people greet one another and visit relatives and friends. Elaborate
dishes are prepared, new clothes are worn, presents are exchanged, and children
have fun.
The following are some recommended acts to be
performed on
Eid
:
a)
Ghusl
or bathing early in the day before the
Eid
prayer.
b)Beautifying
oneself: The Prophet used to wear his best clothes to go to the
Eid
prayer. 
He had a cloak that he wore specifically on the two
Eids
and Friday.
c)Saying
takbeer
(proclamation of the greatness of Allah) is
a distinctive feature of
Eid
and is mentioned in the Quran:
""…And that you should exclaim Allah's greatness
for having guided you, so that you may be grateful."" (Quran 2:185)
When?
The time for
Eid
takbeer's
starts
from the time a person leaves his house heading towards the prayer-hall.  The
Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, would leave his
house on the day of
Eid
saying
takbeer
until he had performed the
prayer.  He would stop saying the
takbeer
after the prayer.
What to Say?
There are various authentic narrations about
what should be said in the
takbeer
. For brevity, we will mention the one
which is most common.
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akar, La ilaha ill-Allah,
w’Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, wa lillahil-Hamd.

·
Itikaf  -
the practice of secluding

Ramadan -
The ninth month of the

·
Taraweeh - These are special prayers performed
in Ramadan after Isha prayers and in which long portions of the Quran are
recited.
Ramadan is a month of fasting, reading the
Quran, and extra prayers; it is the month of good deeds and generosity. The
last ten nights of
Ramadan
are particularly special. Prophet Muhammad
would use these nights to exert himself in worship and generosity. The first of
these nights occurs on the eve of the 21st day of
Ramadan
. In other
words, it is the night that commences after the completion of the 20th day of
fasting.
Prophet Muhammad strove to do acts of worship during the
last ten days of
Ramadan
more than he would at any other time.
[1]
Since as
Muslims we strive to be like Prophet Muhammad in as many ways as possible this
is a time to ask ourselves what we can do to take full advantage of the special
nights ahead.
Attend the Taraweeh
One of the most beautiful and special parts of
Ramadan
is the opportunity to attend
taraweeh
prayers. They are offered throughout
the month. It makes a person feel as if they are part of the thriving community
of Muslims and it is a chance to really concentrate on the recitation of the Quran
and the words of Allah. If you have not been attending
taraweeh
or have
not really put your heart and soul into praying these prayers then the last ten
nights of
Ramadan
are an opportunity for you to increase your worship.
While most mosques offer
taraweeh
prayers after
Isha
prayer, you
will find that some also offer you the opportunity to pray more voluntary
prayers in congregation later in the night. If you are able to attend these
extra prayers offered usually after midnight but before the dawn prayer, you
will find many benefits, including the special closeness to Allah that can only
be experienced in the last part of the night. “Our Lord descends each night in
the final third of the night, and He says: ‘Who is saying a prayer to Me that I
may answer it? Who is asking something of Me that I may give it him? Who is
asking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?’”
[2]
A believer can also use the time between prayers to make
longer heartfelt
dua
. Prophet Muhammad said, “Whoever prayed at night in
it (the month of
Ramadan
) out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward
from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.”
[3]
Search for
Laylat al-Qadr
The rewards and blessings associated with this night are
many. There are many references to
Laylat al-Qadr
in the traditions of
Prophet Muhammad. Some of these indicate that
Laylat al-Qadr
falls on
one of the last ten nights of
Ramadan
, others point to it being an odd
numbered night in the last ten nights. Muslims are told in the Quran that
praying throughout this one night is better than a thousand months of prayer.
For this reason alone it would be wise for a person to seek out this blessed,
holy night by taking worship in these last nights very seriously.
God says in the Quran,
“Verily! We have sent it (this
Quran) down in the Night of Decree. And what will make you know what the Night
of Decree is? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. Therein
descend the angels and the Rooh (Gabriel) by Allah’s Permission with all
Decrees. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.” (Quran 97:1-5)
Practice
Itikaf
Aisha, the beloved wife of Prophet Muhammad reported
that he (Prophet Muhammad) used to practice
Itikaf
in the last ten
nights of
Ramadan
and said, “Look for
Laylat
al-Qadr
in the last ten nights of the month of
Ramadan
”
[4]
Itikaf
is a type of retreat when a person does not leave the mosque and
the remembrance of God except when it is absolutely necessary such as going to
the bathroom.
Renowned Islamic scholar Ibnul Qayyim described the
greater goal of
itikaf
.  “His (a person in
Itikaf
) thoughts are
all of remembrance of God, and thinking of how to attain His Pleasure and what
will cause nearness to Him. This leads him to feel contented with God instead
of the people, so that prepares him for being at peace with Him alone on the
day of loneliness in the grave, when there is no one else to give comfort, nor
anyone to grant solace except Him.”
Make Extra
Dua
Ramadan
is a time of quiet reflection and a
perfect opportunity to make  extra
dua
. This is especially true for the
last ten nights and we should take the opportunity to make long and heartfelt
dua
to Allah. Aisha always made an effort to maximise her worship. In order to do
this she asked Prophet Muhammad what she should say when making dua in t"

Introduction
Fasting and charity are two very important concepts in
the religion of Islam.  Both are among the five pillars of Islam and both have
both voluntary and compulsory forms.  The compulsory form of fasting is the
fast that Muslims undertake in the month of
Ramadan
.  Voluntary fasts
can be performed throughout the year (except
Ramadan
).  The compulsory
form of charity is known as
zakah
and is a fixed portion of a person’s wealth
paid yearly.  Voluntary charity is known as
sadaqah
.  Fasting and
charity are often combined in
Ramadan
when Muslims try to maximize their
rewards.  The rules of fasting and charity can be found elsewhere, this lesson is
about the spiritual benefits to be gained from these acts.
Fasting (
Sawm
)
“Oh you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was
prescribed for those before you that you may gain self-restraint.”(Quran 2:183)
Fasting is an act of spiritual purification; it is an
important act of worship that was legislated in order to bring a person closer
to Allah and allow him or her to experience the benefits associated with piety. 
Throughout the day every time a person conquers his need to eat or drink he
remembers Allah.  Abstaining from food and drink is only one dimension of
fasting.
Abstaining from sinful behaviours is another dimension
that is often overlooked.  Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said that some people gain nothing from their
sawm
except hunger and thirst.
[1]
In another
hadith
he said that if a person does not give up false words and actions, Allah has no
need of him giving up food and drink.
[2]
Fasting purifies the
mind and helps a person gain control over his ego and base desires as well as teaches
a person how to modify his behaviour and change bad habits into good ones.
Sawm
also teaches compassion and empathy for those who go without food or water on a
daily basis.  Patience, gratitude and humility are all qualities that Muslims
strive to perfect and fasting is one way that help inculcate them in our daily
lives.
Fasting is a very special act of worship because it is
something that is between the fasting person and God.  God says in a
hadith
qudsi,
“Fasting is for Me and I alone will reward it”.
[3]
The
du’a
of the fasting person will not be
refused.
[4]
Thus making lots of
du’a
when fasting and at the breaking of your fast is highly recommended.  At the
breaking of fast Allah chooses people to save from the fires of Hell.
[5]
The end of the fast is also one of the two joyful moments associated with
fasting.  The other is when a person meets his Lord and celebrates his
successful fasting.
[6]
Fasting is also a strong
fortress that keeps a person safe from the fires of Hell
[7]
and in addition to this, on the Day of Judgment the fasting itself will
intercede for a person.
[8]
Charity (
Zakah
)
“Truly, those who believe, do good deeds, establish
salah
and pay
zakah
will have their reward with their Lord; no fear shall come
upon them, nor will they grieve.” (Quran 2:277)
The word
zakah
is mentioned approximately 30
times in the Quran and it is coupled with
salah
for almost all of them. 
It is a great act of worship that, like fasting, offers the chance for
spiritual purification.  In the case of
zakah
however it purifies the
heart of both the giver and the recipient and it detaches a person from the
greed and stinginess often associated with wealth.  A person who diligently
pays his
zakah
feels closeness to Allah and a responsibility for the
poor and needy.  To receive
zakah
is also a right given by Allah.  The
person who receives
zakah
finds his heart purified from the envy and
hatred that the poor often have for the rich and powerful.  Thus it strengthens
the ties of brotherhood.
The word
zakah
literally means that which
purifies and it was legislated by Allah for a number of reasons.  It

Introduction
Yearly millions chant the
Talbiyah
‘Lab’baik
Al’laahum’ma Lab’baik, Lab’baika laa Shareeka laka Lab’baik, In’nal Hamda wan
Ni’mata laka wal Mulk, Laa Shareeka lak’
[1]
.
This ‘
Talbiyah
’ is a miracle in the making;
generation upon generation, year after year, millions have said this and will
say it in response to the call of Prophet Ibrahim.  Allah, the Exalted, says:
“And proclaim to the people the
Hajj
[pilgrimage]; they
will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every
distant pass.” (Quran 22:27)
It is reported in the authentic tradition, that when
Prophet Ibrahim finished building the
Kabah
, it was said to him, ‘Call
out to the people!’ he then said, ‘My Lord, how far will my voice reach?’ It
was said to him, ‘Call out, and we shall relay your call and make it
far-reaching!’  Prophet Ibrahim then called out: “O people Indeed Allah has
prescribed pilgrimage (
Hajj
) upon you to the Ancient House (
Kabah
)!”
 People heard his voice and they responded coming from all over saying this
Talbiyah
!
[2]
In this series on
Hajj
, we will talk about some
important aspects of
Hajj
, things that should be in everyone’s mind
along with practical advice that will guide a person while performing it.
Virtues of
Hajj
There are many virtues for
Hajj
, what I will
mention here are the virtues that pertain to
Hajj
in general, and then
mention the rest of them as we discuss the procedure of
Hajj
.
1.It is the fifth pillar of Islam.  Allah, the Exalted, says:
“…And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the
House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way…” (Quran 3:97)
2.It is a duty a Muslim does with complete pride and submission to
God alone.  Due to its difficulty it is described by the Prophet as a form of
Jihad
(struggle); rightly so, as it requires of a person to sacrifice their money,
time and that they must be patient throughout the entire act of worship.  A’ishah,
may Allah be pleased with her said: “I said O Messenger of Allah! We view
Jihad
to be among the best of deeds; shall we not then perform
Jihad
?” He said
to her: “
The best
Jihad
(for you)
is a
Hajj
that is
accepted.”
[3]
3.This act of worship requires that a person dedicates all of his God-given
faculties to perfect it! God has promised those who perfect this act of worship
a great reward; the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said:
The accepted
Hajj
(
Hajj Mabroor
) has no reward except
Jannah
(Heavenly Abode).
[4]
4.The Prophet was asked: “What is the best deed in the sight of
God?” He answered:
“Belief in Allah!”
He was then asked,
“What is
next?”
He answered:
“
Jihad
in the path of Allah.”
He was then
asked,
“What is next?” He said: “An accepted
Hajj
!”
[5]
5.The Prophet said: “O Amr’ do you not know that
Hajj
effaces all sins done before it?”
[6]
6.The Prophet said: The one who performs
Hajj
and does not
engage in sexual activities with his wife during
Hajj
and does not give
into evil behavior (during
Hajj
) will return from that
Hajj
as
the day he was born (i.e.  sin free).
[7]
7.The Prophet said: “As the camel of a person coming for
Hajj
raises and lowers its feet as it walks towards Mecca for the pilgrimage, the
person who has intended the
Hajj
receives a reward for each footstep and
a sin would be removed with each footstep and he would be elevated a rank.”
[8]
8.The Prophet also said: “The one performing
Hajj
is the guest
of Allah; He called upon them to perform this duty and they answered that call!
They shall ask of Him and He will respond to them.”
Conditions of
Hajj
Scholars categorize the conditions for the obligation of
Hajj
into various sub-categories, but in general all are agreed that the
relevant conditions that are applicable today include:
1.Being a Muslim.
2.Intellectual sanity and rational capacity .
3.Reaching the age of puberty.
4.Capability (financial and physical).
The first condition of ‘faith’ is a pre-requisite in all
acts o"

Introduction
Hajj
is a pillar of Islam and an act of
worship that combines, belief, statements and actions; in short it is an act of
worship that requires your full attention.  It is wise for you to leave
shopping, chasing those extraordinary deals, which you will definitely see, for
after the
Hajj
season.
One important gadget that you shouldn’t forget is a cell
phone.  It is advisable that you not use an expensive handset during this
period, but simply resort to using a cheaper one that can be purchased at the
Pilgrims City (upon your arrival in  Saudi).  These cell-phones are usually
sold with a pre-paid SIM card.  Save the number of your group’s director and
Hajj
leader on the phone.
There are 3 types of
Hajj
and this series will be
explaining the most common type,
Hajj Tamattu’
.  In this you will
perform
Umrah
upon arrival from your country before the 8
th
of
Dhul-Hijjah
(the procedure of performing
Umrah
has been
explained earlier).
8
th
Day of
Dhul-Hijjah
We are now on the 8
th
of
Dhul-Hijjah
. 
It is known as the ‘day of
Tarwiyah
’ or 'the day of fetching water and
quenching thirst.' It is called by this name, because the pilgrims would get
ready for this long day and night by feeding their animals and making sure
their camels had enough water for the long journey ahead.  They would also stock
up on water in anticipation of the long stand on the day of Arafah, which was
usually a hot, long day!
When the day of
Tarwiyah
comes, one should enter
Ihram
in the morning from the place where he is in Mecca.  The Prophet, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, donned the garments of
Ihram
at the
Duha
time (the time just after sunrise till just before the sun
reaches its zenith).  He should then say the following:
Lab’baika Haj’jan
(Here I am O Allah performing the
Hajj
) which indicates one’s
intention of performing the
Hajj
.  After that one should say the
Talbiyah
continuously:
‘Lab’baik Al’laahum’ma Lab’baik, Lab’baika laa Shareeka
laka Lab’baik, In’nal Hamda wan Ni’mata laka wal Mulk, Laa Shareeka lak’.
[1]
You would then proceed with your
Hajj
group to
the area of Mina, which literally is a tent city.  Millions of people gather
here on this day from all corners of the globe.  It is wise that you carefully
note the area that you are in; each is marked with a color and an
identification code.  If this fails, then you can simply ask for the general
location of the tents of your country.
It is important for one to try their best to be in Mina
before the sun reaches its zenith.  The pilgrim should busy himself with the
remembrance of Allah and recite the Quran.  One should avoid idle talk and discussion
of worldly matters and argumentation.
Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him said: “
I
heard the Prophet say, ‘Whoever performs
Hajj
and does not commit any
rafath
(obscenity) or
fusooq
(transgression), he returns (free from sin) as the
day his mother gave birth to him
’”.  (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
While here, the pilgrim should perform each prayer (
Dhuhr
,
Asr
,
Maghrib
,
Isha
and
Fajr
) in its time.  They shouldn’t
combine prayers, but each four unit prayer is shortened to two units.
There is a very interesting
masjid
in Mina.  It is known as Masjid Kheef.  The Prophet, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Seventy Prophets
performed prayer in this
masjid
.”
(
Baihaqi
)
It is not required of one to visit that
masjid
or to pray there, some may carry this belief, but there is no
basis for it.
Depending on the bus schedule for your
Hajj
group, you may move from Mina to the next stop in
Hajj
shortly after the
Fajr
prayer or before the
Dhuhr
prayer of the 9th day of
Dhul-Hijjah
.

The 9
th
Day and Beyond
The 9
th
day is indeed a
precious day, thus, one is to utilize every moment of it in a productive
manner! One of the best things one can do is to supplicate to Allah for all
that they desire in this life and in the next.  Some may perceive it to be
inappropriate to ask Allah for worldly riches, but there is no sin in doing
this.  In fact, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
supplicated for Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying:
“O Allah
increase him in wealth, and give him many children and bless him in that.”
[1]
One
should make an extra effort to repent and pledge to Allah that they will turn a
new page in their lives.
At sunset, one is to leave the area of Arafah for
Muzdalifah
[2]
. 
Since one will be with a
Hajj
group, they may leave a bit earlier.  Upon
arriving at Muzdalifah one should perform the
Maghrib
prayer and
Isha
prayer (combining them and shortening the Isha to two units) thus allowing
oneself a good night’s rest thereafter.  A common mistake that is committed by
many is that they will spend their night chatting, taking selfies or surfing
the net.  This is inappropriate, as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of
Allah be upon him, indicated that one should spend this night resting as much
as they can.  One should continue saying the
Talbiyah
at this stage of
the pilgrimage.
The 10
th
Day (The Day of
Eid
)
This is the ‘action-packed’ day for the pilgrim.  The
majority of the
Hajj
rituals are performed herein.  It is best that one
follows this day’s rituals in the manner that Prophet Muhammad performed them
in.
Upon getting up for the Fajr prayer and performing it,
one is to utilize that time to supplicate to Allah, as well one should gather 7
small ‘chickpea’ sized stones for the ritual of stoning that takes place on
this day.
Taking a few extra is recommended
.
Usually after this, the
Hajj
group will take the
pilgrims back to Mina, where they will stone the biggest pillar, which is
closest to Mecca.  This pillar is known as Jamaratul-Aqabah.  It should be
noted that these pillars are not the ‘devil’, but simply a pillar.  In relation
to the reason behind this ritual, one can find its roots in the story of
Prophet Abraham and Ismail, peace be upon them both.  The devil had approached
Ismail and tried to convince him to disobey his father in these three locations. 
Today stoning is conducted in obedience to the commandment of our Prophet.  With
each stone that is thrown one is to say ‘
Allahu Akbar
’.
After stoning the Jamratul-Aqabah, one is to have their
sacrificial animal slaughtered.  Nowadays, this process is more or less
automated through one of the large corporations that takes care of this on
behalf of the pilgrims.  Once this step is ascertained, one can shave off or
trim their hair evenly.  For women, it is sufficient to clip off a small amount
of hair.
Once these actions are completed, one would then head
towards the Haram to perform what is known as
Tawaf
Al-Ifaadah, and the
Sa’ee
of
Hajj
.  These are the five actions that one should perform in this day. 
Once the
Tawaf
is about to be performed, one should stop saying the
Talbiyah
and instead say: “
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La ilaahah il-lal-lah.  Allahu
Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Wa-lil-laahil-hamd
”.
[3]
Due to the infinite mercy of Islam, the Prophet gave
us permits which make it easy for us this great undertaking.  Imagine, if all
the pilgrims had to strictly follow this order, what immense and massive
difficulty would there be upon people! In fact, the Prophet, was approached by
many companions who had informed him that they did not do the actions of this
day in his sequence.  The Prophet said to them:
“You may do that, and there
is no sin upon you!”
One Companion even came to him and said: “O Prophet of
Allah, I performed
Sa’ee
before I made the
Tawaf
!” The Prophet
said:
“You may do that, and there is no sin upon you!”

Importance of
Umrah
Its importance is found in numerous texts; we will list them
here in point form:
1.“Be consistent and perform
Umrah
after having performed
the
Hajj
; for indeed it will remove poverty and sins in a manner similar
to a blacksmith who would purify iron, gold and silver.  Indeed the accepted
Hajj
has no reward except
Jannah
(Heavenly Abode).”
[1]
2.“Performing an
Umrah
followed by another will efface all
the sins between the two.”
[2]
3.“The
Jihad
for the elderly, weak and women is
Hajj
and
Umrah
.”
[3]
Pillars of
Umrah
There are three pillars of
Umrah
:
Ihram
Tawaf
Sa’ee
Ihram
:
Ihram
refers to a state that one enters, wherein one is prohibited from doing certain
things.  These include wearing perfume, clipping nails or cutting hair and
covering the head with direct head-gear.
[4]
A man wears two sheets called “
Izaar
” and “
Ridaa
” and he should
leave his head uncovered.  The “
Ridaa
” covers the upper part of the
body, whereas, the “
Izaar
” covers the lower part of the body.
A woman can wear her regular clothing, but she should not
wear gloves or a “
niqab
”.  She may draw her headscarf over her face in
the presence of non-
mahram
men.
Tawaf
:
It is the
circumambulation around the
Kabah
.  A person does this seven times.
Sa’ee
: It is the
walking and running between the hills of
Safa
and
Marwa
.
These are the three pillars of
Umrah
.
Umrah
also has two compulsory acts that must be met:
1.Entering the state of
Ihram
from outside the
Haram
(sanctuary) area (from a
Miqat
station).
2.Shaving or shortening the hair (for a man) and clipping a small
portion for a woman.
Procedure of
Umrah
Once a person arrives at the
Miqat
station,
whether this is by land or by air they must put on the necessary clothing of
Ihram
. 
A man may wear perfume on his body before entering the state of
Ihram
,
if he chooses, but not on his garments.  He should not apply perfume after
entering the state of
Ihram
.
Before leaving the
Miqat
station, one should say:
“
Labbaik Allaahumma bi
’
Umrah
”
(Here
I am O Allah in response to Your call performing
Umrah
). Upon saying
this one enters the state of
Ihram
.
They would then begin to chant the
Talbiyah
saying:
“Labbaik Allaahumma labbaik, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik, innal-hamda
wan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak”
[5]
.
They continue to chant this until they reach the
Kabah
and
begin to perform the
Tawaf
.  A man is to uncover his right shoulder
throughout the
Tawaf
; this is done by placing the middle part of the
Ridaa
under the right arm and tossing both ends of the sheet on the left shoulder.
Thereafter one is to circumambulate around the
Kabah
seven times; each time begins from the Black Stone.  One is not required to
physically touch or kiss it, but when one is in line with it, they begin their
circumambulation at that point.  During the
Tawaf
one should be mindful
of Allah, asking of Him and begging for His mercy.  One should avoid
idle talk and laughter, for this maybe a once in a lifetime
chance which should not be squandered heedlessly!
It is praiseworthy for one to walk with a faster pace in
the first three rounds.
The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, would say the following between the Yemeni corner and the Black
Stone:

In the previous lesson, we mentioned the conditions of
Umrah
and the procedure of how to perform it. As covered in part one, entering the
state of
Ihram
is a pillar of this great ritual. Since it is a very
essential part of the
Umrah
and
Hajj
experience, it is necessary
to shed further light on the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of this state.
Praiseworthy Practices
1.It is preferable to take the ritual bath before entering the
state of
Ihram
.
2.Cutting the fingernails, shortening the mustache, and
plucking/shaving armpit and pubic hair before entering the state of
Ihram
.
3.Entering the state of
Ihram
after performing an
obligatoryprayer.
[1]
4.Saying the
Talbiyah
: ‘
Labbaik Allaahumma labbaik…
’
after entering the state of
Ihram
. Men should raise their voices while
saying it and women can say it quietly to themselves.
Practices that should be avoided
Practices that should be avoided are referred to as ‘
Mahdthoorat’
of
Ihram
. These actions are not lawful for one who is in the state of
Ihram
.
They are divided into three categories; one specific to men, one specific to
women and one that is relevant to both.
Prohibited for Men and Women during the state of
Ihram
:
1.Cutting hair or shaving it from any part of the body.
2.Clipping fingernails or toenails.
3.Wearing perfume, regardless how subtle the scent.
4.Hunting game animals.
5.Consummating Marriage.
6.
Mubasharah
(i.e. contacting a woman skin to skin) or
doing a thing which may lead to it such as kissing or fondling.
7.Sexual intercourse.
Specifically Prohibited for Men:
1.Covering the head directly with a hat or a turban. Umbrellas or
sitting in the shade of a vehicle or in a tent are allowed.
2.Wearing sewn garments that are usually worn, such as
under-pants, t-shirts and other similar articles of clothing.
Specifically Prohibited for Women:
A woman should not cover her face unless men pass by
her. She can wear whatever she wants as long as it conforms to the Islamic
dress code, and she should cover her hair and she should not wear gloves.
Doing the
Mahdthoorat
ignorantly
If someone does one of these ignorantly he is excused. Whoever
does one of the above
Mahdthoorat
after entering the state of
Ihram
intentionally
would have committed a sin, and would be required to fast
three days or feed six poor/needy individuals.
Practices that are Lawful
1.Taking a shower.
2.Wearing a ring.
3.Wearing a belt.
4.Wearing sandals.
5.Using an umbrella.
6.Using a bandage.
7.Riding a bus.
8.Wearing a watch.
9.Wearing sunglasses.
Unauthentic Practices
Due to the sheer number of people who come from all
walks of life for the
Umrah
throughout the course of the year, it is
important that one not give in to popular beliefs that may be carried by some.
Islam is a religion of ease, not difficulty! Allah, the Exalted, says:
“And thus we have made you a just/moderate nation.” (Quran 2:143)
In light of this verse, we will mention here some odd
beliefs carried by some. One should be watchful for them and not subscribe to
them:
1.Believing that you need a special pair of sandals for
Umrah
.
2.Entering the state of
Ihram
before the
Miqat
station.
3.Chanting
Talbiyah
in a unison voice with a group.
4.Raising the hands, as done in prayer, when facing the Black
Stone.
5.Putting the right hand on the left hand during the
Tawaf
(circumambulation around the
Kabah
)
6.Making a specific supplication at each of the corners of the
Kabah
.
7.Kissing the Yemeni corner
[2]
.
8.Seeking blessings from the
Kabah
by wiping its walls with
a cloth or with the garment of
Ihram
.
9.Kissing and touching
Maqam
of Ibrahim (Station of
Ibrahim).
10.Praying two
rakahs
after completing the
Sa'ee
.
It is important for a Muslim to always follow the
example of our beloved Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be"

Without a Muslim family, substituting Christmas,
Passover, or other religious celebrations with Muslim festivals can be quite a change. 
But, there is no need to worry.  The first step to make a change is to read and
learn about a subject.  The second advice will be to follow the suggestions
given.  Third, make
du’a
to Allah, He is indeed your helper.  These
lessons will teach you everything you need to know along with simple ideas so
you can get more out of this amazing festival and fully experience Islamic
living.
Eid ul-Adha
Basic Facts
Islam has two beautiful celebrations that will be part
of your life:
Eid ul-Fitr
and
Eid ul-Adha
.  Some basic facts
about
Eid ul-Adha
:
·Pronounced EED-ul-ADHA, it can be translated
as the “Feast of the Sacrifice.”
·
Eid ul-Adha
is tied to
Hajj
-
the pilgrimage to the sacred city of Mecca that brings in 2 million Muslims
every year from all over the world.
·
Eid ul-Adha
lasts four days.  On the
other hand,
Eid ul-Fitr
, celebrated at the conclusion of
Ramadan
,
is a one day celebration.
·During
Eid ul-Adha
, many Muslim
families sacrifice an animal and share the meat with the poor.
In accordance to the command of Allah both Muslim
festivals were celebrated since the time of Prophet Muhammad. Hence they are from
Allah and authentic.  No human being made them up.  What is their spirit? Our
Prophet told us,
“They are days of eating, drinking, and remembrance
of Allah.”
[1]
In other words, we can enjoy and have
halal
,
wholesome fun without forgetting our Creator.
Before
Eid ul-Adha
As stated earlier,
Eid ul-Adha
is tied to
Hajj
. 
Performing
Hajj
is one of the five pillars of Islam that is performed in
the 12
th
month of the Islamic calendar known as “
Dhul-Hijjah
.”
Eid ul-Adha
is celebrated by Muslims all over the world on the 10
th
day of the month of
Dhul-Hijjah
.  The first ten days of this month have
a special merit.  In Arabic, they are known as
‘al-Ayyam ul-Ashr.’
The
season of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s
faults and make up for shortcomings or anything that one might have missed.
Virtues of the ‘Ten Days’
The following are five virtues of the
‘al-Ayyam
ul-Ashr’
(the Ten Days):
1.    Allah swears an oath by them in the Quran,
and swearing an oath by something shows us it’s paramount significance and genuine
benefit.  Allah says:
“By the dawn; by the ten nights” (Quran 89:1-2)
Early authorities of Quran have
explained that this verse refers to the first ten days of
Dhul-Hijjah
.
2.    To further convince us of their merit, the Prophet
testified that these are the “best”
days
in the world.  The
Ten
Days
are better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the
last ten days of
Ramadan
! But the last ten
nights
of
Ramadan
are better, because they include
Laylat al-Qadr
(“the Night of Power”).
3.    There are no days greater in the sight of
Allah and in which good deeds are more loved by Him than these ten days, so a
Muslim must frequently recite “
SubhanAllah
”, “
Alhamdulillah
” and “
Allahu
Akbar
” during this time.
4.    The Ten Days include the days of sacrifice
and
Hajj
.
5.    The 9th day of
Dhul-Hijjah
is called
‘Yaum
ul Arafah’
(The Day of
Arafah
).  This is the day when the pilgrims
assemble on the plain of
Arafah
, six miles away from Mecca.  The Day of
Arafah
itself has many virtues.
Virtues And Practices of
Day of Arafah
1.
Yaum al-Arafah
is the day on which
Allah completed the religion of Islam.
2.
Yaum al-Arafah
is one of the biggest
gatherings of any place in the world.
3.
Yaum al-Arafah
is a day on which prayers"

Understanding Animal Offerings on
Eid ul-Adha
Sacrificing one’s son was a test of Abraham’s faith.  To
commemorate and remember Abraham’s trials, Muslims slaughter an animal such as
a sheep, camel, or goat.  The practice is often misunderstood by those outside of
the faith.  Therefore, several points must be understood here:
First, there are no special
rituals involved, other than the animal meeting certain requirements.  The
animal is slaughtered in the same way it is slaughtered any other time in the year. 
The only difference is in the intention.  For regular slaughter, the intention
is the meat, but for
Eid ul-Adha
, it is to worship Allah by commemorating
Abraham’s trial.
Two, God’s Name is
pronounced since Allah has given us power over animals and allowed us to
consume their meat, but only in His Name.  By saying the Name of Allah at the
time of slaughter, we remind ourselves that even the life of an animal is
sacred and we can only take away it’s life in the Name of the One who gave it
in the first place.
Three, good acts atone for
one’s sins.  Offering
udhiyyah
is an act of worship that is no exception. 
Prophet Muhammad said that the most beloved deed on
Eid ul-Adha
is
offering the
udhiyyah
and that it will come on the Day of Resurrection
with its horns, cloven hoofs, and hair.  Its blood is accepted by Allah before
it reaches the ground.  “So let your heart delight in it.” (Tirmidhi, Ibn
Majah)
Laws of
Udhiyyah
for
Eid ul-Adha
a)  Type of Animal
A single
sheep
can be offered as a sacrifice for
a single person or a family.  “At the time of the Messenger of Allah, a man
would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household,
and they would eat from it and give some to others.”
[1]
A camel or cow is
sufficient for seven people, because of the report
“A cow would be
sacrificed on behalf of seven men and we would share it.”
[2]
b)  Age of Animal
The animal should be of a certain age to be fit for
udhiyyah
. 
The minimum ages are:
a)6 months for a lamb or sheep.
b)1
year for a goat.
c)2 years for a cow.
d)5
years for a camel.
c)  Characteristics of the Animal
It should be free of any faults, because the Prophet
said,
“There are four that will not do for sacrifice:
a)
a one-eyed animal whose defect is obvious,
b)
a sick animal whose sickness is obvious,
c)
a lame animal whose limp is obvious and
d)
an emaciated animal that has no marrow in its bones.”
[3]
There are milder defects that do not disqualify an
animal, but it is disliked to sacrifice such animals, like an animal with a
horn or ear missing, or with slits in its ears, etc.  If the animal is
castrated, it is not considered a fault.
d)  Time of Sacrifice
It should be sacrificed at the specified time, which is after
the prayer and
khutbah
of
Eid ul-Adha
has concluded until before
sunset of the 13th day of
Dhul-Hijjah
.  The Prophet said:
“Whoever sacrifices before the prayer let him repeat
it.”
[4]
The meat from the sacrifice of
Eid ul-Adha
is
eaten by family and relatives, given away to friends, and donated to the poor. 
We recognize that all blessings come from Allah, and we should open our hearts
and share with others.

Procedure for The
Eid
Prayer (
Salat ul-Eid
)
The
Eid
Prayer is required (
wajib
). It
consists of two
rakahs
, with extra
takbirs
(saying ‘Allahu
Akbar’). The wisdom behind the
Eid
prayers, like the
Eid
days
themselves, is to thank Allah for His countless blessings. The
imam
will
pray in one of two ways. He will explain how he is praying before the beginning
of the prayer:
METHOD 1
In the first
rakah
of the
Eid
prayer, the
imam
will offer 3 additional
takbirs
after the
Takbiratul-Ihram
and
opening supplication but before reciting the
Fatihah
. Raise your hands
with each
takbir
, as one does for
Takbiratul-Ihram
. After each
takbir
,
let the hands rest at the sides. Place hands together after the third and final
takbir
. After this, the rest of the
rakah
is the same.
In the second
rakah
of the
Eid
prayer the
imam
will recite the
Fatihah
and some portion of the Quran. He will then say
3 additional
takbirs
. They are like the first
rakah’s
takbirs
,
except that you leave your hands to your sides after the third
takbir.
After
these three
takbirs
have been called and completed, one says the
takbir
for going into
ruku
, without raising one’s hands.
METHOD 2
Like any prayer, the prayer begins with
Takbiratul-Ihram
followed by the opening supplication. It is followed by 7
takbeers
in
the first
rakah
and 5 additional
takbeers
in the second
rakah
.
Rest of the prayer is like any other prayer.
Greetings Exchanged On
Eid ul-Adha
Not knowing the greetings flying around during
Eid
can be an uncomfortable experience. Not exchanging any greeting is perfectly
acceptable in Islam, but socially awkward. Therefore, knowing what are the
greetings and their appropriate response will help you with social acceptance.
People from India and Pakistan congratulate one another
by saying “
Eid Mubarak
” (Blessed
Eid
).
Arabs tend to say “Eid Saeed” (Happy Eid) or ‘
kullu
‘aam wa antum bi-khair
’ (may each year bring you good health).
The Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say, ‘
taqabalallahu
minna wa minkum
’ (May Allah accept it from us and from you).
They are all fine. Simply respond by repeating the same greeting
back! It will be fine if you smile or ask for help in repeating back the words.
Advice for
Eid ul-Adha
1.    Take the day of
Eid
off from work or school.
If you cannot, please make arrangements for time off for at least the
Eid
prayer.
2.    Make arrangements for the sacrificial animal
ahead of time. You can go with local Muslims to a ranch or a slaughter house.
It will be an experience you will not forget! You may want to slaughter the
animal yourself or you can have a fellow Muslim do it for you. You can also
send money to an Islamic charity to do it on your behalf and they will distribute
the meat to the poor. For millions of Muslims it is the only time in the year
they get to eat meat. You can locate many charities by doing an online search
for “udhiyyah 2013.”
At least for the first few years after accepting Islam,
I will recommend that you simply send the money to feed poor Muslims overseas
either through your mosque or one of the online Islamic relief organizations.  You
can join the local Muslims to get the experience if you like. Costs of doing
udhiyyah
overseas will vary based on the country you want it to be performed in. A few
organizations are listed below, you can find many more online:
http://www.irusa.org
http://icnarelief.org
www.zakat.org
3.    Call your local mosque or Islamic center a
week before
Eid ul-Adha
to find out the time and place where
Eid
ul-Adha
prayer will be held. After the
Eid
prayer, ethnic sweets and
foods are usually served. Most mosques will hold
Eid
dinners either in
the evening or within the next few days. Find out when and where they are and
attend them.
4.    Do not get lonely or feel isolated. Make
arrangements with your Muslim friends or families ahead of time to visit them for
Eid ul-Adha
. Invite Muslim friends and cook for them. If you can’t cook,
eat out with them. Try to involve your non-Muslim family members by taking them

An Arabic to English dictionary tells
us that the word
ikhlas
means sincerity, purity or isolation.  The word
ikhlas
comes from the Arabic word
akh-la-sa
and it means to render a
deed free of
riyaa
so that there is no consideration other than Allah.  Bearing
this in mind, an Islamic glossary will often describes the word
ikhlas
as the act of purifying motives or intentions so that actions are done
primarily to seek the pleasure of Allah.  When we combine these definitions
with the English dictionary definition of sincerity - being free from pretence,
deceit or hypocrisy - we begin to understand what
ikhlas
is.
Ikhlas
is purifying one’s deeds from all
contamination by
shirk,
in order to worship Allah in the correct way.  For
a person to cultivate and maintain real
ikhlas
he must avoid anything
that calls into question Allah’s right to be worshipped  as the One.
Surah
number 112 is called Al-Ikhlas and it explains very clearly the Oneness of
Allah.  More detailed information can be obtained here,
http://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/253/
“Say, ‘He is Allah, (the) One.   Allah-us-Samad (The
Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks).    He
begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto
Him.’” (Quran 112)
Ikhlas
is being honest with Allah, and worshipping
Him with
ihsan
.
Ikhlas
is closely linked to
ihsan
.  When
a person is consistently aware that Allah sees all he is more likely to
remember the importance of
ikhlas
.  When a person does something
sincerely for Allah, he or she is no longer concerned with receiving praise or
reward from anyone but Allah.   It does not matter who sees you or who does not
see you.  Sometimes a deed can be done for Allah’s sake but the intention is
tainted with boasting and showing off; this is
riyaa
and it may nullify
the rewards that a believer is seeking.  More information about
riyaa
can be found here,
http://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/96/
and will be discussed further in part 2.
“And whether you hide what is in your breast or reveal it,
Allah knows it…” (Quran 3:29)
“…And if you join others in worship with Allah surely your
deeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers.” (Quran 39:65)
In order that a believer’s deeds and actions are
accepted by Allah they must be performed with
ikhlas
, they must be
preceded by the right intention and they must be carried out according to the
shariah
.
“And they were commanded not but they should worship Allah and
worship none but him alone, and give
zakah
, and that is the right
religion.” (Quran 98:5)
Prophet Muhammad emphasised that, “Allah is Pure and He
accepts only that which is pure”
[1]
thus
the
Sunnah
gives prominence to the fact that Allah accepts only that
which is pure and done solely for His sake.  For example, Khalid ibn al-Walid
was removed from his post as commander of the army by Caliph Umar.  Rather than
being offended and refusing to fight, Khalid fought even harder.  When he was
asked why, he said: “I fight for Allah not for Umar.”
Say, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and
my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (Quran 6:162)
The acceptance of a person’s deeds by Allah depends on
purity and sincerity; because it is with such
ikhlas
that a person can
attain a high rank in the sight of Allah.   In fact with the right intention and
a pure heart a person can even be rewarded for an action that they were unable
to perform.  Prophet Muhammad said, “Verily Allah has recorded the good deeds
and the evil deeds.” He then informed those around him that, “Whosoever intends
to do a good deed but does not do it, Allah records it with Himself as a
complete good deed…”

Ikhlas
means that one’s heart is pure and that he or she worships Allah solely to
please Him.  In lesson 1 we established that in order for a believer’s deeds to
be accepted by Allah they must be performed with
ikhlas
, they must be
preceded by the correct intention and they must be carried out according to the
Shariah
.  We will continue our lesson by discussing things that can
contradict or corrupt our
ikhlas; i-e, riyaa
.
Riyaa
is in fact
minor
shirk
, it makes us focus on gaining the admiration and
appreciation of people rather than seeking to please Allah.
A great scholar of Islam once said, “Indeed
the hardest thing to achieve in this world is
ikhlas
.  How many times
have I struggled to extinguish
riyaa
(showing off) from my heart except
that it only appeared again in a different colour”?
[1]
It is clear from
this statement that even the most educated people struggle to remain sincere
and avoid
riyaa.
But indeed it is something that we must avoid.   Prophet
Muhammad said that it was the thing he feared most for his
Ummah
.  “Indeed
the thing that I fear most for you is the minor
shirk
,” he said.  The
sahabah
asked, “And what is minor
shirk
, Oh Messenger of Allah?” To which he
replied, “It is
Riyaa
.  Allah will say to the people of
riyaa
on
the Day of Judgement – when the people are being re-payed for their deeds – ‘Go
to those who you showed off your deeds to in the
dunya
, and see if you
can find reward from them!’”
[2]
There is also a
hadith qudsi
in
which Allah says, “I am Independent of all the partners (ascribed to me).  Whoever
performs a deed while associating partners with Me, I will leave him and
his
shirk
.”
[3]
Riyaa
can be defined as the performance of a deed with the intention
of pleasing someone or something other than Allah.  It is a form of
shirk
and something to be feared because it is easy to fall into
riyaa
without
noticing.
Our good deeds and actions can be
nullified by
riyaa
.  Let us take the example of a man who has $100 he
wants to give in charity.   He begins his act of charity with a pure and
sincere heart and donates $50 but then the idea of showing how rich he is
occurs to him so he makes quite a performance of giving another $50.   It is
possible that Allah will reject the second $50 as an act of charity because it
was mixed with a desire to show off.  If however the idea of showing off
occurred after the total $100 had been distributed it would not affect or
invalidate the act of charity.
Having said this it is important to
bear in mind that it is not showing off if a person feels happy after doing an
act of worship.  This is a sign of faith.   Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said “Whoever feels happy because of his good
deeds and sad because of his bad deeds, is a believer.”
[4]
In addition, if people praise you for a
good deed it is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of, it is a porti"

The thing about knowing
the truth, understanding the purpose of life and knowing the answer to that age
old question of why am I here, is that it is exciting; jumping out of your skin
exciting.  Thus on discovery, the first thing you want to do is tell other
people, and sometimes just blurting out one of life’s universal truths can be a
little bit confronting.  Some might think you are crazy or deluded, but that is
not the problem, because that puts you in such noble company as Prophet
Muhammad or Prophet Noah.  The problem is that when we invite people to the
truth of Islam we want them to listen and understand just what it is we are
trying to say.  Therefore for the benefit of those jumping out of their skin we
will discuss a few tips for inviting others to the right path.
First off let us get our definitions in sync.  The verb,
invite,
means to request the presence or participation of in a kindly,
courteous, or complimentary way.
[1]
Shariah
literally means ‘a path to water,’ the source of all life, thus
Islamically
Shariah
is the straight path to Allah, the Giver and
Originator of all life.   Allah tells us to:
“Invite (call) to the way of your
Rabb
with wisdom and
beautiful preaching and argue with them in a way that is better...”  (Qur’an
16:125)
Whenever we invite a person to Islam, to the right path,
we are presenting them with the attractions and allurements of Islam.   Our job
is to deliver the message in the best way possible according to our knowledge
and abilities.  Acceptance or rejection of the message is up to the person
concerned; there is no compulsion in religion and moreover it is Allah who
bestows guidance.
We
are not converting or reverting them because it is
Allah, and Allah only that truly does that.  Our role is only to assist others
on their journey or to plant a seed that will one day,
InshaAllah
, grow
into a tree of Islam.
“Let there be no compulsion in religion.  Truth has been made
clear from error…” (Quran 2:256)
“…Say, ‘To Allah belongs the east and the west.  He guides
whom He wills to a straight path.’” (Quran 2:142)
It is important to remember however that conveying the
message and calling people to Islam or giving
dawah
, as many like to
call it, is an obligation upon all Muslims.  Of course we are not all expected
to work in the field of
dawah
but we are expected to be aware at all
times that our behaviour, words and actions, are
dawah
.  Those not
familiar with Islam look to Muslims to see just what this religion is all about. 
Prophet Muhammad said, “Convey from me, even if it is one verse”.
[2]
Quran also
reiterates the same message.
“...  And who is better in speech than one who invites to
Allah and does righteousness and says, ‘Indeed, I am of the Muslims. ’” (Quran
41:33)
It all sounds very easy doesn’t it?  We all love Allah
and His Messenger Muhammad and without a doubt we hope that all people will one
day feel the same way.  However love for Islam and all it entails is not quite
enough.  When one accepts the challenge to convey the message one needs to be
prepared.  No longer can we scowl at the shopkeeper when prices rise.  No
longer can we react with anger when somebody mumbles an insult as we walk by.  A
person delivering the message of Islam must be prepared to accept insults, be
patient, make sacrifices, and listen to ideas and ideologies that are far from
the truth of Islam.  Prophet Muhammad said that, “The believer who mixes with
people and bears their insults with patience is better than the one who does
not mix with people or bear their insults with patience.”
[3]
Anyone who is recognisably Muslim is conveying the
message every time they appear in public or mix with non-believers, therefore our
words should always be kind and gentle, and our temper must be completely under
control so that harsh words never leave our mouths.  One of Prophet Muhammad’s
companions said, “We smile at people even if in our hearts we are cursing their
words or behaviour”.
[4]
Moreover a Muslim makes things easy for others.  This is what Allah expects and
Prophet Muhammad encouraged when he said, “Teach and make things easy, do not
make them difficult.  If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.”
[5]
“...  Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make
things difficult for you…” (Quran 2:185)
Prophet Muhammad understood human weaknesses and at the
same time understood human potential for excellence.  His

These days supernatural phenomenon
is stressed in most modern fiction, movies, and TV programs.  Everyone has read
about witches, sorcerers, vampires, wandering spirits, and werewolves.  While
much of it is just that – fiction, according to Islamic teachings, there is an
element of truth to the supernatural phenomenon.  Some people may have direct
experience of the horror out there, who have always had questions, but never
had the right answers.
First we need to understand what is meant by
supernatural phenomenon.  “The Supernatural” is what lies outside nature and
hence outside science as well.  Therefore, what is supernatural seems
inherently mysterious and therefore scary.  Human beings fear what they do not
know.
Therefore, to sort out fact from fiction, we rely on the
only true source of supernatural knowledge, and that is Allah’s revelation
contained in the Quran and the
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad.  Once we
understand that the supernatural can be understood through revelation, we
conquer our fear of the unknown as we learn ways Allah has taught us to keep us
safe and protected.
According to Islamic teachings, the following are the
major sources of supernatural harm:
Jinn and demons
The jinn are real and they are creatures
created by Allah.  Among them are demons (disbelieving jinn) and believers.  They
can see us but we cannot see them.  Demons can attack human beings and
terrorize them.  A demon may also possess the body of a human because it either
fell in love with the human or to harm him, or possibly another reason.
Envy and jealousy of others
Destructive envy means wishing that a
blessing that Allah has given another person be taken away.  Wishing to have
what somebody else has (an object or skill) is not envy, desiring it to be
taken away from them is what makes it destructive.
“Evil eye”
The “evil eye” is when a person hurts another
with his “stare.” The starting point is when the person likes something, and
then by repeatedly looking at the object of his jealousy, his evil feelings
affect it.  To clarify this in a more simple tone, if a person is in the
presence of someone whom he wishes to marry, and she happens to smile in his
direction, the individual may feel lightheaded and even dizzy at that point;
likewise, when a person is standing before someone whom he fears, such as his
boss, and he dreads that he will be fired, and he is suddenly called, that
person will feel a slight sensation of pain and may even faint. The evil eye
incorporates this aspect, as well it goes beyond by the nature of one’s
self…the jealousy and pure hatred a person has for a blessing someone is
blessed with and the burning desire that he has to see it removed. Everyone who
puts the “evil eye” on another is envious, but everyone who envies does not put
the “evil eye” on another.
Witchcraft and sorcery
Witchcraft and sorcery are real and may
affect people psychologically and physically, so that they become sick and even
husbands and wives can be separated.  Most of it is done by means of
Shirk
and by offering demons what they love.
The truth is that in and of itself, nothing is capable of
hurting you unless Allah allows it to.  In other words, you should have a firm
belief that Allah is in control, not any created being.  That is why, a Muslim
should not let paranoia, anxiety, doubts, suspicion, and excessive fear of the paranormal
overwhelm him so much that he becomes afflicted with psychological illnesses.  One
should think positively about Allah and understand that whatever befalls only
happens by the permission of Allah.  Evil is not outside of Allah’s control.  There
is no sorcerer, demon, or “evil eye” that is stronger than Allah.  Since, He is
in control, He alone is able to ward off harm and relieve distress.  If this is
understood, a person will turn to Allah and put his complete faith in Him.
In order to properly trust Allah, a Muslim must have the
correct belief and knowledge.  First, Allah knows what’s best.  Allah says in
the Quran,
“… Perhaps you may dislike something and it is good for you
and you may like something and it is bad for you.  Allah knows and you do not
know.” (Quran 2:216)
Second, Allah is Just.  He tells us,
“… And your Lord will not wrong anyone.” (Quran 18:49)
Third, Allah is sufficient for anyone who puts their
trust in Him.  He has declared,
“…And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice
him...” (Quran 65:3)
A Muslim can protect himself by giving up sins, carrying
out obligatory religious duties, having strong faith in Allah, by putting his
trust in Him as explained above, and seeking refuge with Him by reciting the
prayers for protection narrated from Prophet Muhammad.

·
Deen
- the way of life based on Islamic

Deen
is
often used to mean faith, or the religion of Islam.
When explaining the
message of Islam the most important thing to remember is
Tawheed
.  It
must form the basis of any explanation we give about any topic related to the
deen
.
Tawheed
is the basis of Islam and without a doubt our discussions must
emanate from this important principle.
Quran emphasizes that every messenger sent by Allah
began by inviting his people to
Tawheed
.
“And We sent a messenger to every nation (proclaiming): ‘Worship
Allah and shun false deities!’...” (Quran 16:36)
“And We never sent any messenger before you, except that we
revealed to him that ‘There is no deity worthy of worship except Me, so worship
Me’“ (Quran 21:25)
“Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he said, ‘O my people!
Worship Allah!  You have no other deity other than Him.  Certainly, I fear for
you the torment of a Great Day!’” (Quran 7:59)
According to learned people both past and present, any
call to Islam that does not begin with
Tawheed
is doomed to failure.   Prophet
Muhammad instructed the
sahabah
to preach
Tawheed
when sending
them to various communities.  To those who went to Yemen he said, “You are
going to the People of the Book, so let the first thing that you invite them to
be the
Tawheed
of Allah”.
[1]
The title ‘People of the Book’ refers to the Jews and
the Christians, those given scriptures for guidance before the Quran was
revealed.   It is often easier to start a conversation about Islam with Christians
and Jews because they already believe in God.  Quran is filled with references,
and stories that can be easily related to and to which they already have their
own versions.  For instance mentioning the
surahs
of Quran that are
named after easily recognisable people such as
surah
19 – Maryam (Mary),
surah
14 - Ibrahim  (Abraham) or
surah
12 – Yusuf (Joseph).
Quran beseeches Prophet Muhammad to call the People of
the Book to Islam.  And Prophet Muhammad in his
Sunnah
made clear the
relationship between all of the prophets and messengers of Allah.
“Say O Muhammad ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and
Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship
none but God (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none
of us shall take others as lords besides God.’” (Quran 3:64)
“And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be
in (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say, ‘We
believe in that which has been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God
and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted’”.  (Quran 29:46)
“I am the nearest of all the people to the son of
Mary, and all the prophets are brothers and there is none between me and him (i.e. 
there is no other prophet between me and Jesus).”
[2]
“If a man believes in Jesus and then believes in me
he will get double reward.”
[3]
People who have no understanding of any of the three
monotheistic religions, such as Buddhists require different guidelines.  It is the
responsibility of the person giving
dawah
to have a basic understanding
of the beliefs of the non-believers they are calling to.  Buddhism for instance
is a way of life, but not in the same sense as Islam.  Put simply Buddhism, as
well as many eastern religions have a concept by which the person who does good
actions will eventually attain Godlike qualities.   On the other hand Hindus
believe in one Supreme God among many, and some of the more obscure religions
such as Zoroastrianism and Baha’i do include the concept of One Supreme God.  However,
you do not want to speak down to anyone as if you know more about their belief
system then they do themselves.  This is important whether that is the case or
not.  Remember, you do not want to offend anybody or inadvertently start an
argument.  More information about other religious beliefs can be found on our
other website
www.islamreligion.com
.
If a person has a strong belief in God or even a
nameless Supreme Being responsible for the creation, it is possible to teach
them that the God we call Allah is the same God that they call by other names
such as Elohim or Yahweh.  "

The aim of inviting people to the right path is to
convey the message; we are not accountable if they do not convert. As mentioned
earlier it is Allah that provides the guidance and the desire to accept Islam.
Remember that whenever we intend to convey the message we must do so with
wisdom, eloquent speech and in the most gracious manner. Arguments and heated
discussions are not the best methods of
dawah.
One who has accepted Islam must convey the message to
those nearest and dearest to him. Once a person has tasted the sweetness of
faith it becomes impossible not to desire that for all family members and
friends. Calling family members must be a first priority but sometimes it can
be the hardest work of all. Sometimes when you are the first member of your
family to heed the message you plunge the other members of your family into a
state of shock; especially if they do not mix with any Muslims in their daily
lives.
Your family needs a little time to accept the reality.
Make sure you have a supply of easy to read small books or pamphlets. If you
live at home you could leave them lying around, if not keep a supply in your
bag or car. People often want to know this or that and sometimes you simply do
not know the answer to all those questions. You are often just learning
yourself so don’t be tempted to make up an answer. Perhaps you could look it up
together remembering to always emphasis the Oneness of Allah, the Creator of
all that exists.
Your family and close friends will be watching closely
and this is when your behaviour will play a big part. You have probably given
up a lot of big things such as alcohol, parties, free mixing with the opposite gender,
and pork and pork products.  However, you have also added lots of little things;
more kind acts, generosity, eagerness to be helpful, more gracious manners and
a desire to establish strong unbreakable family ties. Showing kindness and
observing high moral standards is possibly the best way to introduce someone to
Islam. Good manners and courteous behaviour is also a very good form of
dawah
.
You are a role model for what Islam is all about.
Prophet Muhammad’s behaviour attracted others to Islam.
His beloved wife Aisha called his character a living example of the Quran.
[1]
He was kind and courteous to everybody and even his enemies could not help but
praise his noble character. This is the behaviour we must endeavour to emulate
and the people that will benefit the most are our family and close friends. A
kind word, a smile, a gift, or help of any sort, will showcase the beauty of
Islam.
Be particularly careful not to despair when you see your
family or friends engaging in behaviour that you now consider misconduct. Do
not abandon them because of their ways. You can leave their company if they are
drinking alcohol or acting in a non-Islamic manner - abandon the place, or the
situation, not the person. Invite them to your house and to your events so they
can see that fun and happiness can be found without alcohol or distasteful
entertainment.
Conversations at your workplace are also a way to spread
the message of Islam. Handing out pamphlets probably isn’t going to win you any
friends or influence people but your mannerisms and ways of dealing with people
will. Remember however that your colleagues are likely to be as shocked as your
family. If you have recently converted to Islam don’t expect fanfare and
congratulations but do expect curiosity. Again don’t give unqualified answers
to things you are not sure about. The one thing you are sure about is the
Oneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped.
Never give up hope. You may not see the people you love
entering Islam and it can be a source of great disappointment. However it is
wise to remember that it is Allah that guides a person to the right path.  Your
role in that process might be as little as being a friendly face in an
otherwise bleak day. Hope is something that Muslims have in abundance, so make
small efforts and lots of
du’a
for the people you love and those around
you.
Spreading the message and calling people to the right
path is the work that was carried out by all of Allah’s messengers. Each one
called his own people to the One God, Allah.  Prophet Muhammad however was sent
to all of humankind; he gave the good news to the believers of immense reward
in the Hereafter, and warning the unbelievers against a severe punishment.
Prophet Muhammad expected all of those "

Definition of Sin & its Types
A sin is defined as an act of disobedience
in which a person leaves Allah’s command.  A sinner contradicts
Shariah
by opposing a command of Allah given in the Quran or
Sunnah
.  Scholars
describe a sin with the image of “stepping out” of divine obedience by doing
what is forbidden or leaving what is required.  Islam teaches that man is not
born in sin, rather he becomes sinful when he commits a sin.
Sins can be categorized into:
a)
Kufr
(disbelief): It takes a
person outside of the fold of Islam and makes him a disbeliever.  Examples of
this sin will be clarified below, but it should be clear that
kufr
will
take a person out of the fold of Islam when they are consciously aware of the
nature and severity of the sin they are doing.  In essence,
kufr
constitutes
completely “stepping out” of Islam and divine obedience.  A person who commits
kufr
is called a ‘disbeliever’ (Arabic:
kafir
) and he is no longer a Muslim. 
If he dies in that state, he will enter into Hell and stay there forever (9:84;
24:55).  It should be noted that calling someone a
kafir
(disbeliever)
is not to be done by the average individual; it is a ruling issued by Islamic scholars.
If a Muslim sees another committing an act of
kufr
they are to give that
person advice repetitively but the title ‘disbeliever’ should not be given to
him.
It is important to note
that despite stepping into disbelief, a person can re-enter Islam at any time
before
death.
b)
Major and minor sins
: The one who
commits major and minor sins does not lose all their faith and is within the
fold of Islam (49:6; 2:282).  Such a person is a Muslim, but with damaged faith
(Arabic: “
imaan
”).
The remaining lesson will explain disbelief.
Definition of Disbelief
“Disbelief” (Arabic:
kufr
) is defined as absence
of faith (Arabic:
imaan
) by all Muslim scholars.  It does not matter
whether the person speaks of it or holds it in the heart.
[1]
In other
words, ‘disbelief’ (Arabic:
kufr
) is any word, act, or belief that
contradicts faith (Arabic:
imaan
).
Examples of Disbelief
1.Committing
shirk
.
2.Hating or cursing God and the Quran.
3.Hating, cursing, abusing, or making fun of Prophet Muhammad even
if a person is convinced of his truthfulness.
4.Saying Prophet Muhammad lied.
5.Knowing the Prophet conveyed the truth, but rejecting to follow
his teachings.
6.Making fun of any teaching of Islam.
7.Prostrating to an idol.
8.Worshipping Prophet Muhammad the way Christians worship Jesus.
Who is a Disbeliever, a
Kafir
?
A disbeliever is a person who disbelieves in the message
of Prophet Muhammad. It is one who has not uttered the two testimonies, lacks
the correct Islamic faith (
imaan
), or holds a belief, says a word, or
does an act of disbelief.
There is an important point to be understood here.  If a
person who becomes a Muslim by uttering the Testimony of Faith (
shahadah
)
holds a belief, says, or does what is considered
kufr
, he may not necessarily
become a disbeliever.  The reason is that after becoming a Muslim, there are
certain obstacles that prevent a person from becoming a
kafir
.
Reasons That Prevent a Person from Becoming a Disbeliever
A Muslim might fall into disbelief, but not become a disbeliever
due to one of the following reasons:
[2]
1.Ignorance
A convert, a Muslim who grew up in a remote area, or a
Muslim who was raised in an irreligious environment may be ignorant of the
basic beliefs, religious duties, and prohibitions of Islam.  Such a person may
not know, for example, that Islam prohibits homosexuality or requires prayers
five times a day.  These people may fall into disbelief, but will not become disbelievers
because in the sight of Allah they may be excused due to their ignorance.
2.Mistake
A person may miss the mark and do something he never
intended.  He may simply make an unintentional, honest mistake.  For example,
if a convert to Islam believes that consuming alcohol is only forbidden at
prayer times. From a textual perspective, consuming alcohol, while believing it
to be lawful, is an act of disbelief, but this person would not become a
disbeliever because of the honest mistake h"

With respect to their severity,

(sing.
kabirah
) and are mentioned in Quran 4:131, 42:37, 53:32.  Minor
sins, or
saghair
(sing.
saghirah
) are mentioned in Quran 18:49.  All
deeds, including major and minor sins, are recorded and these records will be
given to the individual on the Day of Judgment (Quran 18:49, 54:2-3).
Definition of Major Sins
[1]
Any sin for which the Quran or
Sunnah
prescribes
a punishment in this world such as for murder, adultery, and theft; or about
which there is a threat of Allah’s anger and punishment in the Hereafter, as
well as anything whose perpetrator has been cursed by our Prophet.
Definition of a Minor Sin
A minor sin is every sin that does not have a prescribed
punishment for this life or a threat attached to it in the Hereafter.
Do Major Sins Make a Person a Disbeliever?
Sins damage faith by reducing it.  A Muslim’s faith
reduces in proportion to the amount of his sins.  Nevertheless, neither major,
nor minor sins eradicate faith completely.  A sin does not turn a Muslim into a
non-believer unless the person believes the sin to be permissible.  He might
deem a sin permissible either because he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge that
Allah has forbidden it or he doubts the prophethood of Muhammad, may the mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon him.  In either case, when a sin is tantamount
to denying the Quran and rejecting Prophet Muhammad the doer of that sin steps
into disbelief without even doing the sin.  For example, if a person insists
that Allah has allowed fornication, while they know it is forbidden in the
Quran, that person turns into an disbeliever. Otherwise, we do not consider
people to become non-Muslims on account of a sin they commit.
The proof that a person who commits a sin is considered
Muslim is found in the Quran and Prophetic Traditions:
1.The Quran says:
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up
with him in worship but He will forgive whoever He wishes for anything besides
that.” (Quran 4:48)
2.Whoever dies without committing
shirk
with Allah shall
enter Paradise.
[2]
3.A person who believes in
Tawheed
will enter Paradise even
if he fornicates and steals.
[3]
There was an alcoholic in the time of the Prophet.  One
time when he was punished, a Muslim cursed him.  The Prophet forbade that Muslim
from cursing that Companion and he said: ‘Do not curse him, for by Allah, he
loves Allah and His Messenger.’
[4]
Due to his belief in Allah and His Prophet, the major sin that he was doing did
not wipe out all his faith.
How Are Major Sins Forgiven?
Major sin can be forgiven by the following ways:
a)    Through sincere repentance, which entails
leaving the sin, having remorse for performing it, and resolving to never
perform it again.  If the sin involves wrongdoing towards others, then in
addition to the above, he must also restore their rights or property or seek
their forgiveness.
When Allah sees this
sincere repentance from one of His slaves – a slave who truly turns to his Lord
in fear and hope – He not only
forgives
the sin, but
replaces
those sins for good deeds to the slave’s credit.  This is from Allah’s infinite
grace and mercy.  Allah says this right after mentioning the sins of
shirk
,
murder, and adultery, He says: “Except those who repent and believe, and do
righteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and
Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Quran 25:70)  This blessing is only
for one who has faith, whose repentance is sincere, and who strives to work
righteous deeds.
b)   By Allah’s pure grace, generosity, and favor. 
Allah may therefore forgive whomsoever He wills without that individual having
actually repented.
c)    By the performance of certain acts, like
Hajj
,
according to some scholars.
Fate of a Person Who Dies Committing Major Sins
A person who dies from an unrepented major sin is at
Allah’s discretion in the Hereafter.  If Allah wants, He may punish him first acc"

The punishment for sin is lifted from a person by the
following:
1.  Repentance
Repentance
has
conditions which have been discussed earlier.  There is no repentance if those
conditions are not met.  Meeting the conditions of repentance guarantees
forgiveness.  Repentance guarantees forgiveness from major sins as well.  Allah
says:
“Say: ‘O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves
(by committing sins)! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, indeed, Allah forgives
all sins.  Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’” (Quran 39:53)
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and
forgives sins” (Quran 42:25)
2.  Praying for forgiveness
Asking for forgiveness is not tied to strict conditions
like repentance.  It is simply a prayer that Allah may or may not accept.  The
Prophet said:
“If a person commits a sin, then says, ‘O Lord, I have
committed a sin so forgive me,’ He says, ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who
may forgive sins or punish for it; I have forgiven My slave…’”
[1]
3.  Doing good deeds which wipe out sins
Allah says:
“Indeed, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.” (Quran 11:114)
·Daily Prayers and Friday Prayer
“Each of the five daily prayers and from one Friday
prayer to the next is an expiation for the time in between, so long as one does
not commit any major sin.”
[2]
·Ablution
“When a Muslim, or a believer, washes his face (in
the course of ablution), every sin which he committed with his eyes, will be
washed away from his face with water, or with the last drop of water; when he
washes his hands, every sin which is committed by his hands will be effaced
from his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when he
washes his feet, every sin his feet committed will be washed away with the
water, or with the last drop of water; until he finally emerges cleansed of all
his sins.”
[3]
·Fasting
Ramadan
“Whoever fasts
Ramadan
out of faith and the
hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.”
[4]
“Whoever spends the night of
Laylat al-Qadr
in prayer out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be
forgiven.”
[5]
·
Hajj
“Whoever performs Pilgrimage to this House, and
does not engage in sexual relations with his wife during it and does not engage
in sinful behavior will go back free of sin like the day his mother gave birth
to him.”
[6]
Righteous deeds such as prayer, fasting,
Hajj
,
etc only expiate for transgressions against the rights of Allah.  With regard
to sins that have to do with the rights of other people, one has to repent from
them.
4.  Prayers of fellow believers such as the funeral prayer
The Messenger of Allah said:
“There is no Muslim man
who dies, and forty men pray the funeral prayer for him, not associating
anything with Allah, but Allah will accept their intercession for him.”
[7]
Angels also pray for the believer:
“Those who bear the Throne, and those who are around it,
glorify their Lord with His praise, and believe in Him.  They ask forgiveness
for those who believe, saying, Our Lord, You embrace all things in mercy and
knowledge.  Forgive those who turn to You and follow Your path.  Save them from
the punishment of Hell.” (Quran 40:7)
5.  Intercession of the Prophet on the Day of Resurrection
The Prophet said:
“My intercession will be for those among my
ummah
who committed major sins.”
[8]
And he said:
“I was given the choice between admitting half of
my
ummah
to Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession.”
[9]
6.  Allah wipes out sins by calamities of this world
The Prophet said:
“No tiredness, exhaustion, worry,
grief, distress or harm befalls a believer in this world, not even a thorn that
pricks him, but Allah expiates some of his sins thereby.”
[10]
7.  The torment, squeezing, and terror of the grave will also
expiate sins.
8.  Undergoing the horrors, distress and hardship of the Day
of Resurrection will expiate some sins.
9.  Mercy of the Most Merciful
By the mercy of Allah, with no cause on the part of
His slaves, many will be forgiven.
[11]
Unforgivable Sin
If a person dies as a
kafir
he will not be
forgiven. "

What drives us?  What makes us do the things we
do?  What makes us happy?
Many people will answer maximizing pleasure and
minimizing pain is the ultimate key to human happiness.
If so, how come people can be happy while in
pain and unhappy while experiencing pleasure?  If pleasure is not the only
motivating force that drives us, what does?  What desires must we fulfill to
live a happy life?
For most of those who see happiness in the carnal,
rather than the spiritual, it is pretty basic: desire to avoid pain and
anxiety, desire to spend time with relatives, desire to eat, desire for sexual
gratification, desire for companionship, and desire for recognition to name a
few.
Life for such can be toilsome, provoking the
plain query; what is it really aiming for?  In their quest for happiness, all
too often people fall short of achieving any kind of inner peace.  We think
that by always reaching higher and accomplishing more - more money, a better
body, the perfect mate - we will automatically be happy.  That is an illusion. 
People get caught up in chasing the materialistic dream under the illusion
money can buy happiness until they discover the limits of materialism.  Impressing
the neighbors and envy of possessions leaves us devoid of passion and depth in
our lives, leading to the Modern Man’s Paradox:  Spiritual hunger in an age of
plenty.
What is the paradox?  Simply put, it is this: As
members of certain materialistic societies have grown richer, they have grown
less content with their lives.  No society in the history of the world has ever
enjoyed the standard of living known today in these societies: Incomes are up,
prices are stable, unemployment is down, life expectancy is rising; they enjoy
more freedom and opportunity than ever before.  Even their poor live well by
world standards.  Yet in America, for example, since 1960, the divorce rate has
doubled, teen suicide has tripled, violent crime has quadrupled, the prison
population has quintupled, and some estimates put the incidence of depression
in the year 2000 at ten times what it was in the year 1900.  Americans are less
happy today than they were 40 years ago, despite the fact that they make 2.5
times as much money.  Our bellies may be filled, but we are left spiritually
hungry.
To find out what really drives human behavior,
two kinds of happiness must be distinguished: feel-good happiness and
value-based happiness.  Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure.  When
we joke around or eat our favorite food, we experience feel-good happiness.  This
type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time.
Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives
have meaning and fulfill the larger purpose of our existence by connecting us
to Allah.  It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our
deeper purpose and values.  Living a God-conscious life rooted in the values of
the Quran and
Sunnah
, a Muslim is driven - beyond sensual pleasures - by
the desire to make it to Paradise and to be safe from Hell after death.
Islamic values that take a person towards Paradise and away from Hell are the most significant factors in motivating a Muslim’s
behavior and in contributing to his or her sense of happiness. The desire to achieve
 Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all
other desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on
wealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of
making it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of
devotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on
pleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One
must remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.
To be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams
and realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!
Ultimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate
goal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. 
Paradise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of
God, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence
of pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is
an abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel
the least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally
realized.

·To learn about some of the joys that Paradise

·To appreciate that the greatest joy will be
seeing Allah in Paradise.
The Joys of Paradise
Those who enter Paradise will do so in their
most perfect, beautiful form.  Their hearts will be one.  They will neither
spit, nor blow their noses, or defecate.  They will remain young forever,
strong and potent without the inconveniences of body hair.
The worldly pleasures pretty much fade in the
face of heavenly delights
.
The pleasures of this world are
fleeting and short-lived, for ‘…short is the enjoyment of this world,’ whereas
the joys of Paradise will be unending, as ‘…the provision is eternal.’
The fine clothes, delicious foods, soothing
drinks, ornate jewels, and grand palaces in Paradise are far superior to what
is in this world.  The ‘real estate’ of Paradise is described by the Prophet to
be better than the whole world!
Paradise is free of any pollutants, foul odors,
pain, or discomfort.  The hearts and speech will be pure.  No one will be
offended or insulted.
The delicious, ripe fruits of Paradise will be
within easy reach, ready for its residents to pick whatever fruit one desires. 
Any food or drink will be available on demand.  Paradise has seas of water,
wine, milk, and honey from which rivers will flow out.  You simply take your
pick!  It has fountains scented with camphor and ginger, and shady valleys.  The
wine will not cause hangovers.  It is “delight for those who drink”, bringing
neither drunkenness
[1]
nor rousing
folly or quarrelling.
The inhabitants of Paradise will be served in
gold and silver goblets and dishes.  Their finest silk clothes will be
decorated with gold, silver, and pearls…better than any man-made garment!  The
scent of Musk will emanate from their bodies..  Their palaces will distinguished
by refined elegance and be fully furnished.  They will be able to sit and
recline in their gardens.  The beautiful bright colored couches will be lined
with silk brocade.  Eye catching cushions and splendid carpets will add style
and luxury.  A cozy place most people can simply dream of in this world, and  tranquil
spot away from distractions;  peaceful, comfortable, and richly decorated.
The faithful, who ‘will be served by immortal youths,
with cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine;’ exquisite banquets
served in priceless vessels.
The faithful will visit one another and reunite
with family and friends who made it to Paradise.  All wishes will be fulfilled,
some in the strangest ways.  The Messenger of Allah said:
“If the believer in Paradise wishes for a
child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in
an instant.” (
Al-Tirmidhi
)
Naturally, running after worldly pleasures at
the cost of heavenly delights will be a cause of much sorrow for people who
will enter Hell.
Spouses & Intimacy in Paradise
Just as some people can’t perceive colors, so we
may be soul-blind and soul-deaf.  The soul’s yearnings simply don’t get through
to consciousness; or if they do, we try to numb ourselves to them with
medications or frenzied activities.  The resulting alienation within our very
hearts bears its own loneliness.  The soul wants to be attached and involved,
because it is through such intimacy that it is nourished, initiated, and
deepened.  The faithful will enjoy earthly and heavenly spouses in Paradise
to satisfy the soul’s cravings for companionship and intimacy.  All the
urgencies of the soul – the feeling of longing, the ache of desire for a
beautiful, compatible partner, and the urgency to visit old friends – will be
met.  The select will rejoice in the company of the parents, spouses and
children who were believers.
The faithful will be clothed in the richest
silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns
set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, and pillows. In order
to enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,
and vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise
“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most
able to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and
strength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose
their youth.”
The faithful will enter Paradise in the best and
most perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their
eternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.
The faithful will enjoy specially crafted
maidens, or
houris
, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of
mortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,
and inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public
view in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of
gratification.
Vision of Allah
In heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly
and distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through "

Remembrance of Allah
Almost every person in the
modern world is involved in some basic worldly activity like earning a living,
going to school, eating, sleeping, and socializing.  Naturally, we forget Allah
and the obligations due to Him.  When we forget Allah, this life and its
worries become the central occupation of the human mind.  Desires run wild.  A
person begins to ‘chase his shadow’, something he can never catch.  For many,
money becomes the sole goal of life.  The more you make, the more you spend,
the more you want.
Allah has set times to break
regularly from the daily chores of life for a few minutes and worship Him.  First
thing in the morning before we begin our day, in the middle of the day, in the
late afternoon, in the evening, and at night before we go to sleep.  When done
with concentration and properly, it awakens and stimulates the soul.  A Muslim
reminds himself that Allah is in charge of everything, he is Allah’s faithful
servant, and Allah’s pleasure is His aim.  For a few minutes, five times a day,
a Muslim leaves this world and meets  His Lord:
“And establish the prayers (
salah
)
in order to remember Me.” (Quran 20:14)
Taqwa
(God-consciousness)
The prayers (
salah
) also
makes a person God-conscious.  When a person prays five times a day, he becomes
accustomed to feeling the presence of God and develops the sense that Allah is watching
Him at all times.  He is never hidden from Allah, even when alone.  A sense of
God-consciousness keeps the heart suspended between fear and hope.  Fear of
Allah keeps a Muslim away from the prohibited and encourages him to do the
obligatory; a mix of divine love and devout reverence that keeps him
religiously observant. Regular performance of the prayers increases one’s awareness
of Allah.
Seeking Forgiveness
To err is human, and even the
most pious of Muslims sin and need to repent.  We all need to constantly ask
for Allah’s forgiveness and try our best not to repeat our mistakes.  Without
regular contact with Allah, a person is unlikely to feel guilty for his sins
and repent.  Sometimes if a person has not asked Allah to forgive him in a long
time, he might become insensitive to sinning and may even forget that he fell
into it, thus not even seeking forgiveness for it.  Certain prayers in the formal
prayers (
salah
) reminds the Muslim of his sins and makes him seek
forgiveness for them  This in turn causes Muslims to feel guilty for their sins
and seek repentance as soon as they are committed. A Muslim learns to constantly
seeks forgiveness for his sins and never feels too distant from his loving Lord.  
The prayer places man directly before Allah seeking pardon for his short-comings.
The prayer itself is a means of
erasing sins, albeit the lesser ones
[1]
.
Messenger of Allah, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked:
“What do you think if
there was a river by the door of any one of you and he bathed in it five times
a day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?”
They (his companions) said,
“No trace of dirt would be left on him.”
The Prophet said, “This is
like the five daily prayers, through which Allah erases sin.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Control and Discipline
The prayer has the capacity to
catalyze change for the better in people’s life.  The fact that we give up
whatever we are doing and line up behind a prayer leader (called
imam
) five
times a day in the mosque, or find room to pray in at work or school by
ourselves, instills discipline in life.  People join the army to learn
discipline and everyone admires it.  Similarly, the prayer trains us to go
through specific motions and utter special words at specific times.  All the
body parts are under control, obeying and worshipping Allah, and if this
discipline is broken, the prayer may have to be repeated.
Islam recognizes that we are all
different, so it allows flexibility in many cases.  The prayer leader (
imam
)
should keep the prayer short.  Women are not required to attend the prayers in
the mosque.  A sick person may pray sitting, and if unable, he may even pray
laying down.  The discipline learned in the prayer is to be acquired in other
aspects of one’s religious and mundane life as well.  Just as we should not
look around when praying, we should control our eyes outside of the prayer not
to fall on forbidden objects.  Just like we use our tongue to prai"

Hadith
– (plural –
ahadith
) is
a piece of information or a story.  In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
Why
am I here is an age old question that has plagued humankind for millennia.  What
is the purpose of my life, what is the purpose of anyone’s life? Those and
other similar questions have been asked by people as long
as human life has existed.  It is expressed by someone, somewhere all the time. 
It is expressed in many different forms, such as ""What should I do?"",
""Why are we here?"", ""What is life all about?"", and
""What is the purpose of existence?"" and even ""Does life exist at
all?""  In the great scheme of things Muslims are in a very privileged position
because when these existential questions pop into our minds we are able to
comprehend the answer.
The reason that we (humankind) are here, on this tiny
planet spinning in a seemingly infinite universe, is to worship Allah and Allah
Alone.   This is the purpose for which we were created.  It is not a secret or
a mystery nor is it an enigma or a puzzle.   Finding the meaning of life is
possible with only one thing, a desire to fulfil Allah’s plan.  There is no
need for hours or months or years of searching and yearning.
“And I (Allah) created not the
jinn
and humankind,
except to worship Me (Alone).” (Quran 51:56)
“Oh humankind, worship Allah, you have no other Allah but
Him.” (Quran 7:59)
However it is important to understand that Allah is not
in need of human worship.  If not a single human worshipped Allah, it would not
diminish His glory in any way, and if all of humankind worshipped Him, it would
not increase His glory in any way.
[1]
“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes
you, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let
believers put their trust."" (Quran 3:160)
""O humankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but
Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise."" (Quran
35:15)
Because we are fragile humans we need the comfort and
security of worshipping Allah.  In addition to that we will not find true
happiness and contentment until we at the very least attempt to fulfil our
purpose in life.  The purpose of our existence is more meaningful than being
slaves to the
dunya
.  Allah states that the reality of this
dunya
is full of deception and warns us not to fall for its temporary enjoyments.  We
should focus on our purpose in life in order to secure our place in the
Akhirah.
In a
hadith
Prophet Muhammad tells us that,
“Allah says, 'Son of Adam, fill your time with my worship and I will fill your
heart with richness, and end your poverty.  But if you do not, I will make your
hands busy (in
dunya
affairs) and I would not end your poverty.’”
[2]
The religion of Islam explains our purpose plainly,
whilst giving us clear guidelines to follow in order to make our worship easier
and more fulfilling.  Everything is explained in the Quran and the
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad.  They are our guide books for a life full of purpose and
contentment.    They are the only means to true happiness but this however does
not mean that we will not be tried and tested.   Allah states very clearly in
Quran that He will test us.
“He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of
you is best in deed...” (Quran 67:1-2)
Of course the life of a human being can be filled with
play and pleasure, but this is not the purpose of our lives.  Allah says in the
Quran that we were indeed created for a purpose beyond that of mere delight and
enjoyment.  The reality of life is that we will be resurrected to account for
every detail of our lives.
“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any
purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?” (Quran 23:115)
One of the easiest ways to have the best of everything
is to worship Allah in everything that we do.  Islam makes this easy.  It is as
simple as following the guidelines set out for us.  To remember Allah at every
opportunity and to conduct our lives knowing that Allah is watching us, and
angels are recording our every move.  By worshipping Allah we are doing ourselves
a favour.  When we are God-conscious we act in an upright manner and stay away
from being evil and oppressing others.  And we also know that the laws of Islam
are designe"

What is
Shariah
“
Shariah
” is a misunderstood word
second to ‘Jihad’ and is usually translated as ‘Islamic Law.’ An incomplete translation
leads to much confusion.  Therefore, we must first understand the meaning of
the term.
In essence, “
Shariah
” refers to what Allah has
legislated for His slaves,
[1]
whether it be beliefs, practice, worship, or morals.  It is the totality of
Allah’s commands.
[2]
Another author defines ‘
Shariah’
to be the ‘commands, prohibitions,
guidance and principles that God has addressed to mankind pertaining to their
conduct in this world and salvation in the next.’
[3]
Shariah
includes the following
[4]
:
1.Creed: including the oneness of Allah, rejection of
shirk
,
belief in Angels, Divine Scriptures, Prophets, and the Last Day.
2.Ethics: being true, trustworthy, keeping promises, and rejection
of immorality like lying, breaking promises, etc.
3.Religious Practices: matters related to worship and dealing with
fellow human beings including specific crimes and their punishment.
In short,
Shariah
guides all aspects of Muslim
life, including daily prayers, marriage, divorce, family obligations, and
financial dealings.
Unique Features of
Shariah
1.
Shariah
comes from Allah
.  It is Allah’s
revelation to His Prophet Muhammad, either directly in the form of the Quran or
indirectly in the form of
Sunnah
.  This in turn means:
a.The principles of
Shariah
are free of injustice and are
not subject to human discretions.  An example is the equality of human beings
regardless of their color, gender, or language.  They are only ‘distinguished’
from each other based on their good works!
b.
Shariah
is to be upheld by all believers, whether they are
rulers or the ruled because it is from Allah.  An example is the prohibition of
drugs and alcohol; it is forbidden upon all without exception.
c.
Shariah
promises the doer of good works great rewards in
this life and in the next, and warns the sinner of a grave punishment in this
life and the next.  The recompense of the life to come is tied to living by and
applying
Shariah
in one’s daily life in matters like ablution, prayer,
and zakah.
2.
Shariah
is timeless and universally applicable.
We
believe that
Shariah
is suitable and applicable for all times and places.
3.
Shariah
is comprehensive.
It includes matters of
belief, Islamic ethics, and rules governing speech and action.  The rules
governing speech and action are called “
fiqh
” or Islamic jurisprudence and
can be further subdivided into the following categories:
a.Worship like prayer and fasting.  It governs a person’s relation
to his Lord.
b.Human relationships that include personal, civil law, financial
law, law of war and peace, and criminal law.
4.
Shariah
is humane.
It brings ease and removes
hardship which is a natural consequence of its comprehensiveness and perfection. 
Allah says,
“…Allah desires ease for you and does not desire hardship for
you…”(Quran 2:185)
Therefore,
Shariah
eases an obligatory duty when
performing it causes an excessive hardship and it temporarily allows a prohibited
action when there is a dire need for it
[5]
.
“…But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it]
nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him.  Indeed, Allah is
Forgiving and Merciful.” (Quran 2:173)
An example of a hardship that would ease an obligatory
duty is if one falls ill or is travelling, they can break their fast.
5.
Shariah
is based on justice.
What is meant is not
only a judge applying the law fairly to everyone, but the law itself being just. 
That is a natural consequence of its divine source. True justice should
establish an equilibrium by way of fulfilling rights and obligations and by
eliminating excess and disparity in all spheres of life.  The standard of
justice in the Quran is referred to in some fifty passages.  People are urged
to be just to others at all levels, whether personal or public, in words or in
conduct, in dealing with friends or enemies, Muslim or non-Muslim, all must be
treated with justice.  Allah says in the Quran,
“We sent Our messengers with evidences and revealed the Book
and the balance through them so as to establish justice among people…” (Quran
57:25)

examples would be the duty to pray five daily prayers and the prohibition of alcohol. 
They are definite and clear.  Fiqh also includes many practical details of religious
matters that are speculative.  Does bleeding invalidate ablution?  In ablution,
is it required to wipe the entire head or only part of it? Answers to such detailed
questions can be found in books of
fiqh
.
What is the Relationship Between
Shariah
and
Fiqh
?
[2]
1.
Shariah
is the actual rules revealed by Allah
.  There
is no contradiction or conflict between them.  It is binding on all Muslims.  As
for
fiqh
, it is derived by the scholars of Islam known as
fuqaha
(jurists) from the texts of
Shariah
or other methods such as
qiyas
and
maslahah mursalah
.  These deduced rules may or may not agree with
the
Shariah
.  In other words, when a scholar is correct in his
understanding,
Shariah
and
fiqh
are in agreement.  When a scholar
makes a mistake,
Shariah
and
fiqh
separate.
Shariah
does
not exist in a vacuum.  It is found within
fiqh
.
[3]
2.
Shariah
is complete,
fiqh
is not
.
Shariah
is mostly general principles and maxims from which guidance for all aspects of
our daily life is deduced.
Fiqh
, on the other hand, is the opinion of
scholars in many cases.  For the most part
Shariah
provides guidelines
which are elaborated in
fiqh
.
3.
Shariah
is general and addresses all human beings unlike
fiqh
.
4.
Shariah
is binding whereas parts of
fiqh
are
not binding
.
Fiqh
provides relevant answers to its contemporary
society for a specific place.
Shariah
is time and place independent.
Shariah
mostly provides general directives whereas detailed solutions to particular and
unprecedented issues are developed in
fiqh
.
5.
Shariah
is perfect whereas
fiqh
is not.
Shariah
does not contain errors since it is considered divine revelation, but
fiqh
can sometimes be wrong as it is a human endeavor and a product of reasoning.
Rules of
Fiqh
Rules of
fiqh
are categorized on a scale of five
values:
1.
Wajib
(obligatory): what is required upon a Muslim, like the
five daily prayers.
2.
Mustahab
(recommended): what a Muslim is encouraged to do,
like fasting on Mondays and Thursdays.
3.
Mubah
(permissible): what is left up to a Muslim to do or
leave, like picking a certain food or drink.
4.
Makruh
(disliked): what is better to leave for a Muslim,
like praying while food is being served.
5.
Haram
(forbidden): what a Muslim is prohibited from, like
adultery and theft.
The Stages of the Evolution of
Fiqh
Fiqh was developed over the course of time across
different geographical areas of the Muslim world.  It’s evolution over a span
of 1400 years can be classified into six stages
[4]
:
1.Foundation: era of Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him, 609 -
632 CE.
2.Establishment: era of the Righteous Caliphs, 632 - 661 CE.
3.Building: era of Umayyad dynasty, 661 CE - 8
th
century.
4.Flowering: era of rise and decline of Abbasid dynasty, 8
th
century - middle of 10
th
century.
5.Consolidation: from decline of Abbasid dynasty to murder of last
Abbasid Caliph, 960 CE - middle of 13
th
century.
6.Stagnation & Decline: from sacking of Baghdad to the present,
1258 CE - now.
Qualifications of a

The three basic qualifications of an Islamic scholar who
specializes in
fiqh
are:

One of the

once asked Prophet Muhammad
which was the first
masjid
built on earth.  He replied, “The Sacred Mosque
in Mecca”.  “Which was next?” the
sahabi
asked and the Prophet replied “Al-Aqsa
Mosque in Jerusalem”.
[1]
Prophet Muhammad advised his followers not to prepare
for a religious journey except to three mosques.
[2]
These three mosques are the three holiest sites in Islam
and are situated in three sacred cities, Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem.  All
three cities are in the Middle East, two in present day Saudi Arabia and the
other in the Holy Land, now known as either Palestine or Israel.  In two
lessons we will look closely at the significance of the three cities and
discuss what they mean to Muslims around the globe.
Mecca
Mecca is home to the largest
masjid
in the world,
Masjid Al-Haraam
(The Sacred Mosque).  It surrounds the
Kabah
, a
cube shaped structure that Muslims believe is the world’s first house of
worship.  In the 21
st
century the
masjid
has a large outdoor
terrace with white marble floors that reflect the bright light during the day
and are floodlit at night.   It is a huge space that allows for the influx of
up to 4 million people in the
Hajj
season.  It is a space that is always
awake and where people from all over the globe congregate to spend their days
and nights in worship and contemplation.   Mecca nowadays is a far cry from its
humble beginnings.
The area in which Mecca stands has been the subjects of stories
stretching back to the very beginning of time.  Both the Quran and the Bible
mention Mecca’s earlier name of Becca as a place of worship.  “…Blessed are
those whose strength is in You who have set their hearts on pilgrimage.  As
they pass through the valley of Becca, they make it a place of springs…”
[3]
“Verily the first house of worship appointed for mankind was
at Becca…” (Quran 3:96)
The first Muslims prayed towards MasjidAl-Aqsa in
Jerusalem.   While in exile in Medina Prophet Muhammad received a revelation
from God instructing him to turn towards the
Kabah
.   Thus it became the
qibla
for Muslims throughout the world.  The historians and scholars of
Islam have differed on who built the
Kabah
.  Some say that it was built
by the angels.   Others say the father of humankind, Adam built the
Kabah
but over many centuries it fell into disrepair only to be rebuilt by Prophet
Ibrahim and his son Ishmael.   All agree that the
Kabah
was either built
or rebuilt by Prophet Ibrahim.
“And remember when Ibrahim and his son were raising the
foundations of the House (the
Kabah
at Mecca), (saying), ‘Our Lord!
Accept this service from us.  Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower’”
(Quran 2:127)
Prophet Muhammad was born in the city of Mecca in 570
BCE.  At that time Mecca was an oasis on the trade routes between Yemen and the
Mediterranean Sea.  There is historical evidence indicating that goods from all
over the known world flowed through the markets of Mecca.   And pilgrims used
to come to visit the
Kabah.
At that historical point in time, it was filled
with statues and idols.
Each year pilgrims travelled to Mecca and Prophet Muhammad’s
tribe, the Quraish
[4]
,
made a very good living by trading with the pilgrims.  Muhammad’s prophethood
put their very lucrative livelihoods into jeopardy and this was one of a
complex myriad of reasons why they wrought havoc upon the Muslims and
eventually drove them from the city.
Prophet Muhammad once said of Mecca, “By Allah, you are
the best and the dearest of all lands of Allah to Him.  Had I not been driven
out of you, I would have never left you.”
[5]
And, he once observed, “Allah, not the people, has made Mecca a sanctuary;
therefore, any person who believes in Allah and the Last Day should neither
shed blood in it nor cut down its trees.”
[6]
When Prophet Muhammad returned to Mecca he took control
of the city with great diplomacy, and with boundless mercy towards its
inhabitants.  He purged the
Kabah
of idols and the Arabian Peninsula of
any worship except to Allah.   Mecca took its place in history as the spiritual
centre of Islam.
Medina
Medina, also in present day Saudi Arabia, is
the second most sacred city in Islam.  Its importance derives from the presence
of
Masjid Al-Nabawi

Medina (
continued
)
The second most sacred city in Islam is Medina. It
is in the western region of Saudi Arabia in the area known as the Hejaz. Medina
is the Arabic word for city and it is known as “the city” meaning it is the
city of Prophet Muhammad. It is also sometimes known as Medina Munawwarah
meaning the city of enlightenment.  Originally called Yathrib, Medina is the
city to which Prophet Muhammad and the fledgling Muslim community migrated when
life became too difficult in Mecca.
The original Prophet's Mosque was an open-air
building with a raised platform for sermons. It was a square enclosure of approximately
30 by 35 meters and was built from palm trunks with mud walls. It could be accessed
through three doors and its basic plan has since been adopted in the building
of many other mosques throughout the world.
The
Masjid
also contained a shaded area to the south
and a prayer area facing north towards Jerusalem. When the
qiblah
was
changed to Mecca, the
Masjid
was re-oriented to face Mecca. This space
also served as a community centre, court, and school. In only seven years the
Masjid
space was doubled to accommodate the ever increasing number of Muslims.
It is here in the
Masjid
that the tomb of Prophet
Muhammad is located. Because prophets are generally buried where they die,
Prophet Muhammad was buried in the home of his wife Aisha. This was originally
attached to the
Masjid
but in the intervening centuries the
Masjid
has expanded to such a degree that even the cemetery known as Al-Baqi, once on
the outside of the city, now marks the outer precincts of the
Masjid
.  The
graves of some of Prophet Muhammad’s family members and many
sahabah
and
early generations of scholars can be found here.
One of the most significant and important reasons why
Muslims all over the world long to visit this city filled with light and
learning is the fact that it has many blessings.
""The person who offers 40 prayers consecutively in
my
Masjid
, without missing a prayer in between, will secure immunity
from the fire of Hell and other torments and also from hypocrisy.""
[1]
Prophet Muhammad said, ""I was ordered to migrate to
a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that
is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities
of iron.” And he also said, ""There are angels guarding the entrances (or
roads) of Medina, neither plague nor
the Dajjaal
(Antichrist) will be
able to enter it.”
[2]
Medina and its surrounds are filled with the places and
sights that are infused with Islamic history. The site of the Battle of Badr is
approximately 20 miles south west of Medina, and four miles north is the site
of the Battle of Uhud. Also within a short distance is the place where the Battle
of the Ditch was fought.  Masjid Al-Quba the first mosque built  in Islam and
whose foundation stone was laid by Prophet Muhammad himself can be found here
in Medina, so too is Masjid Al-Qiblatain, the mosque built on the  site where
the revelation  to change the
qiblah
direction came. Before this
revelation the first Muslims prayed facing towards Jerusalem.
Jerusalem
The city of Jerusalem is the third most sacred site in
Islam. According to Islamic history, Prophet Jacob, built a
masjid
on
the Al-Aqsa site approximately 40 years after his grandfather Prophet Abraham
built the
Kabah
in Mecca. It was later rebuilt or expanded by King
Solomon, a man considered by Islam to also be a Prophet.
Glorified be He Who took His slave on a journey by night from Masjid
Al-Haraam to Masjid Al-Aqsa, the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in
order that We might show him of Our signs.  Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the
All-Seer. (Quran 17:1)
Muslims are much attached to Jerusalem because God
refers to it in the Quran as “the neighbourhood whereof we have blessed”.  A compound
called Masjid Al-Aqsa lies within the city of Jerusalem.  The name Al-Aqsa translates
to the farthest
masjid
. However there are multiple mosques and centres
of learning on the 144,000 square metre site including the most identifiable
building in Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock.
The golden shining dome stands out on the Jerusalem
skyline and can be recognized by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. In an event
known as the Night Journey and Ascension, Prophet Muhammad ascended to the
lowest heaven from a rock that is now found inside this most famous symbol.  On
the same journey Prophet Muh"

Introduction
The core of the religion of Islam is the attestation to
two phrases:
(i)
La ilaha illa Allah
(meaning ‘There is
no god rightfully worshipped except Allah’)
(ii)
Muhammad rasoolu Allah
(meaning
‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah’)
These two phrases are known as the
Shahadah
, or Testimony
of Faith. Through the belief and attestation of these two phrases one enters
the fold of Islam. It is the central belief that a believer maintains
throughout his life, and is the basis for all his beliefs, worship and existence
in this world.
Every Muslim, including someone new to Islam, has to
understand the meanings of these two phrases, and try to live his life
accordingly.
The Importance of the Testimony of
Faith
This Testimony is by far the most important aspect of
the religion of Islam, upon which the whole religion is built. Islam is the
only true monotheistic religion, stressing that no worship should be directed
to any other except Allah. It is a way of life in which a person obeys and
worships the orders of Allah and none else.
This Testimony of Faith (
Shahadah
) reminds us of
our purpose in life, which is the worship of Allah alone.  Allah says in the
Quran:
“And I have not created neither jinn nor humans, except to
worship Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)
The message of the Oneness of God (
Tawheed
) found
in the Testimony was not particular to the message of Prophet Muhammad, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him. It was the universal message of all
Prophets of Allah. Since the dawn of humanity, Allah sent Messengers to every
people and nation, commanding them to worship Him Alone, and to reject all
false deities. Allah says:
“And indeed We have raised amongst every nation a Messenger,
[commanding them] ‘Worship Allah, and reject all false deities.” (Quran 16:36)
The Meaning of
La ilaha illa Allah
The meaning of each word in the
phrase is:
La
: There is no;
ilaha
:
god (deity);
illa
: except;
Allah
: Allah (God)
And therefore the literal
meaning of this phrase is “There is no god (deity) except Allah”
First Part of this phrase: Rejection
‘There is no god (deity)’… Here, god with a small case
‘g’ is anything which is worshipped. Many people have taken things in creation
as their gods and deities, but they are all false and are wrongfully worshipped,
meaning that they have no right to that worship, nor do they deserve it. This
rejection extends to all superstitions, ideologies, ways of life, or any
authority figures who claim divine devotion.
Some people imagine the Divine Kingdom of God to be like
earthly kingdoms. Just as a king has many ministers and trusted associates,
they imagine ‘saints’ and minor deities to be our intercessors to God.  They
take them as agents through whom God is approached. In truth, there are no
intercessors in Islam, nor any class of clergy to whom one must ‘confess’ their
sins to be forgiven. A Muslim prays directly and exclusively to God. We also
reject superstitious practices such as astrology, palm reading, good luck
charms, and fortune-telling.
Second Part of this phrase: Affirmation
‘Except Allah’… After denying the right of any created
being to be worshipped, the Testimony affirms divinity for Allah alone, with ‘…
except
Allah.’
Allah, in the Quran, mentions in many places that all
things which people take as objects of worship besides Allah do not deserve any
worship, nor do they have any right over it, as they themselves are creations
and have no power to bring any benefit.
Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created
nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for
themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor
of raising the dead. (Quran 25:3)
Thus,
la ilaha illa Allah
means, “There is no
true
god except Allah” or “There is no god rightfully worshipped except Allah.”
The Meaning of
Muhammad rasoolu Allah
The meaning of each word in the
phrase is:
Muhammad
: Prophet
Muhammad;
rasoolu
: Messenger;
Allah
: Allah (God)
And therefore this phrase means,
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah”.
By testifying to this fact, one affirms that Prophet
Muhammad is in fact a Prophet and Messenger raised by God, amongst mankind to
deliver the message of God, as were other Prophets and Messengers. Attesting to
this fact implies a multitude of meanings. These include:
1.  To believe
that he was the
last
Prophet and Messenger.
“Muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the
Messenger of Allah and the last of the Prophets and Allah is Ever All-Aware of
everything” (Quran 33:40)
2. To believe
that he delivered the message of Allah faithfully just as he r"

Introduction
The Arabic word
shirk
[1]
is the opposite of
tawheed
, Allah’s oneness and uniqueness, and is more
inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.
Shirk
contradicts the very
purpose of creation as expressed in the Quran:
“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship Me.”
(Quran 51:56)
Prophets were sent with the mission to eradicate
shirk
and to invite humanity to single out Allah in worship.
What is
Shirk
?
Shirk
is to associate someone other than Allah in
those aspects which are unique to Allah and His exclusive right.
Shirk
is to worship created beings like Allah is worshipped, to venerate created
beings like Allah must be venerated, and to assign a portion of His divinity to
someone else.
Severity of
Shirk
There is no issue upon which Islam is so strict as the
one of
tawheed
(monotheism).  Therefore,
shirk
is considered the
greatest
violation with which the Lord of the heavens and the earth is defied.  The
severity of
shirk
can be summarized in the following points:
(1)
Shirk
makes the Creator like His
creation, in that matters that are exclusive to Allah are associated with
others who have no right to it.  Therefore, Allah declares
shirk
to be
the greatest wrong,
“Indeed to ascribe partners (unto Him) is a tremendous wrong.”
(Quran 31:13)
(2)  Allah has declared that He will not forgive
the sin of
shirk
unless the person repents from it,
“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner should be set up
with Him, and forgives all besides that to whom He pleases.” (Quran 4:48)
(3)  Allah has forbidden Paradise to those who do
not repent from committing
shirk
, condemning him to Hell for eternity,
“Surely whoever associates (others) with Allah, Allah has
forbidden to him Paradise and his abode is the Fire.” (Quran 5:72)
(3)  All the good works a person may have done are
lost, become worthless, and are rendered vain if a person dies unrepentant of
shirk
,
“And certainly, it has been revealed to you and to those
before you: if you should associate (anything) with Allah, your work would
surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.” (Quran
39:65)
(4)
Shirk
is the deadliest of all major
sins.  On one occasion, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, asked his companions if they knew what was greatest of all major sins. 
He then explained to them,
“The major sins are:
shirk
, not being kind
to one’s parents…” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
Types of Shirk
(1)  Greater
Shirk
(
Shirk
Akbar)
(2)  Lesser
Shirk
(
Shirk
Asghar)
Definition of Greater
Shirk
Greater
Shirk
is associating others with Allah in
those aspects which are unique to Allah in his person taking a rival or associate
unto Allah and making it an equal to Allah.
Shirk
in Allah Being the Lord
This category includes:
(i)   Atheism (the belief that human beings have no
Lord).
Pharaoh denied the existence of Allah and claimed his
own self to be the Lord over Moses and the people of Egypt.  He announced to
people:
“I am your Lord, Most High.” (Quran 79:24)
Modern day philosophers that deny the existence of Allah
or scientists who consider the universe created itself or has no beginning or
end fall under this category.  Also, the idea that nature itself is God, or
that God dwells within His creation is also
shirk
.
(b)  The belief that Allah shares His rule and
control over the creation.
People who fall into this category are those who may believe
in Allah’s powers and abilities, but also believe that Allah is several
“persons,” that He is somehow “split” into different beings.  An example is
Christians who believe that Allah is God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Spirit, all at the same time.  Also, Hindus believe in One God who takes
the forms of Brahma – the creator-god, Vishnu – the preserver-god, and Shiva –
the destroyer-god.  Islam teaches that Allah is One in every sense: perfect,
indivisible, and complete.
Another example of this
shirk
is held by people
who pray to the dead.  They believe the souls of the saints and other people
can meddle in the affairs of mortal men, that somehow the departed souls can
cause change in the life of men and women by answering their prayers or in
other ways.  The truth "

Greater
Shirk
:
Shirk
in Allah’s Right to Worship
In this category of
shirk
, acts of worship are
directed to other than Allah and the reward for worship is sought from the
creation instead of the Creator.  Praying, bowing, and putting one’s forehead
on the ground are acts of worship reserved only for Allah.
“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah, being
sincerely obedient to Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, lo, they
commit
shirk
with Him.” (Quran 29:65)
Examples of
Shirk
in Allah’s Right to Worship
(1)  To love Allah correctly is to worship Him.  A
form of greater
shirk
is giving someone a portion of love reserved for
Allah.  Allah is the only One loved for His own sake.  Two things beloved for
their own sake cannot coexist in one heart.  Love of Allah is different from
the love of one’s parents, spouse, or children as it is coupled with a feeling
of His awe and holiness and leads a person to pray to Allah, trust Him, hoping
for His mercy, fearing His punishment, and to worship Him alone.  Loving other
beings as Allah should be loved is
shirk
in love. A Muslim should not be
attached to anything else to a level where it enslaves his heart.  Hearts get attached
to power, money, glamour, women, music, drugs, and alcohol, to name a few.  These
things can become the ‘god’ in one’s life who a person chases day and night,
and, once he gets the thing he loves, he works hard to please it.  That is why
the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said a man who
worships money will always be miserable
[1]
and
the Quran says,
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides
Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But those who
believe love Allah (more than anything else).” (Quran 2:165)
(2)
Shirk
in supplication.  First, supplication
or invocation (known as
du’a
in Arabic) is part of worship as the
Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Supplication is the essence of worship.” (
Abu
Daud, Al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad
)
Calling upon dead saints, righteous men or those who are
absent and far away for help and assistance as Allah should have been prayed to
is greater
shirk
.  It includes praying, invoking or supplicating to a
false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides Allah.  Christians
pray to a man, the Prophet of Allah, Jesus, whom they claim to have been God
incarnate.  Catholics pray to saints, angels, and Mary as the “mother of God.”  It
is also
shirk
to pray to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings
of Allah be upon him, or to deceased holy men believing that they can answer prayers,
as Allah says,
“Say: ‘Behold, I have been forbidden to worship those whom you
invoke instead of Allah.’” (Quran 6:56)
“And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits
you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.”
(Quran 10:106)
“If you pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they
heard they could not grant it you.  On the Day of Resurrection they will disown
association with you.  None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.” (Quran 35:14)
(3)
Shirk
in obedience.  Allah is the only
Ruler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver
[2]
,
the Absolute Judge, and the Legislator.  He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just
like the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the
moral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from
wrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,
determine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human
interaction and behavior.  His is the command:
“His is the Creation and Command.” (7:54)
“Legislation is not but for Allah.  He has commanded that you
worship not except Him.  That is the correct religion, but most of the people
do not know.” (Quran 12:40)
Obeying religious leaders in matters of clear
disobedience to Allah is a form of greater
shirk
as Allah says:
“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and
their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)
They made partners unto Allah not by directly praying to
them, but by willfully accepting their rabbis and clergy changing the lawful
into prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave
their religious men the authority only Allah has - to set the divine law.  For
example, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church has the authority to determine
how God is t"

Arabic Terms
·
Shirk
- a word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
·
Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved
.
·
Ummah
- Refers to the whole Muslim
community, irrespective of color, race, language or nationality.
·
Riyaa
– It comes from the word
ra’aa
meaning to see, to behold, to view. Thus the word
riyaa
means showing
off, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically
riyaa
means to perform
acts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than
Allah.
Definition of Lesser
Shirk
Lesser
Shirk
is what has been specifically called
shirk
in the Quran and
Sunnah
, but does not reach the level of greater
shirk
.  
Also, lesser
shirk
is said to lead to greater
shirk
.   Some
scholars have said lesser
shirk
is so vast that it is difficult to
define it precisely.   The most important examples of lesser
shirk
are:
Charms & Omens
Wearing charms, talismans, and amulets for protection
against the evil eye, bad luck and the like thinking that Allah has placed
these powers in them constitute lesser
shirk
.  This is discussed in more
detail
here
.
Swearing an Oath in the Name of Other than Allah
Taking an oath, or swearing, in the name of someone
other than Allah is a type of lesser
shirk
given that a person does not
intend to venerate the one in whose name the oath is being taken, else it turns
into greater
shirk
.   The Messenger of Allah, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said,
“The one who takes an oath in the name of other
than Allah commits disbelief or
shirk
.”
[1]
Riyaa
(Showing-Off)
The Messenger of Allah said:
“The thing that I fear most for you is lesser
shirk
.”
They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is lesser
shirk
?”
 He said:
“
Riyaa
(showing off), for Allah will say on
the Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom
you were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find
with them.’” (
Ahmad
)
Riyaa
is to perform worship in order to be seen
and praised by people.
Riyaa
renders a deed void; the person earns sin
instead of reward from Allah, and it exposes him to punishment.
Human beings, by nature like to be praised, are not fond
of criticism, and do not like to be seen deficient in any way.   Islam views doing
religious acts to impress others instead of pleasing Allah - what should have
been done for Allah is done for people - as
shirk
.   The Messenger of
Allah said:
“Allah (glorified and exalted be He) said: ‘I am so
self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate.  Thus he who does
an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action
renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.’” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
There is a good chance of a believer falling into
riyaa
because it is hidden, it sits in the heart, pollutes the intention, and a
person has to be extremely vigilant to correct it.  Ibn Abbas, one of the
Prophet’s companions, said,
“
Shirk
in the Muslim nation is more hidden
than a black ant crawling on a black stone in the middle of a moonless night.”
[2]
Intention is a simple matter, but sometimes changing it
can be difficult.   A person has to listen to their heart and see what motivates
a certain action.  A Muslim has to carefully watch his intention to keep it
pure whenever he performs a good deed like
salah
(ritual prayer), giving
charity, fasting, serving his parents, or even smiling.  Perhaps this is why
the saying of Allah’s Name has been prescribed before all acts of importance in
daily life – eating, drinking, sleeping, going to the toilet, waking up, and
going to sleep.  Remembering Allah keeps the heart aware of Allah and the
intention pure.
Let us understand with simple examples how
riyaa
may affect worship:
(a)  Let us say the basic motive when you stand up
to pray is for people to see you, or notice you are praying, wishing to be praised. 
This invalidates the act of worship.
(b)  Let us say you started off to pray with
sincerity, your intention was to pray for Allah, but then you started thinking
about pleasing people, and slowly your intention changed.  You do one of the
two things.  If you resist the temptation of getting noticed, it will not have
any effect on you because the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said:
“Allah has forgiven my ummah "

Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
Allah Created Everything
So how does it all start? Allah.  Nothing else.  The
Prophet of Islam was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, where was our Lord before He
created His creation?” He said: “Nothing existed but Him, with nothing beneath
Him and nothing above Him.”
[1]
Think about how amazing that is, basically it tells us
that there is nothing but Allah that is truly worthy; creation needs Allah and
nothing else because in the beginning there was Allah while there was nothing
else.
Allah says in the Quran:
“Allah is the Creator of all things and He is the Guardian
over all things.” (Quran 39:62)
So everything besides Allah was created by Him, is under
His dominion and His disposal, and He brought it into existence.
Jubayr, a contemporary of Prophet Muhammad describes
himself, saying, “I was one of the greatest enemies of the Prophet,” and he
said, “I hated him more than any other human being on the face of this earth,”
but then something strange happened.   “One time I walked into the mosque and I
heard the Prophet reciting verses from
Surah
at-Toor (Quran 52:35-36),
‘Were they created from absolutely nothing or are they themselves suggesting
that they are the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth?
Rather they have absolutely no idea, they are at confusion!’”
Jubayr says that at that moment when the Prophet said
that, even though he wouldn't officially accept Islam until later on in his life,
“faith entered my heart.   I knew at that point that there is absolutely no way
that there is no God!”
If you just sit with yourself and you go through the
process of elimination of the possibilities of how we and everything else
around us is here, you will find that there is no other way to explain it
except by Allah.
Creation of Water and the Throne (
Arsh
)
Prophet Muhammad said: “Nothing existed but Him,
with nothing beneath Him and nothing above Him.   Then He created His Throne
above the water.”
[2]
The Prophet tells us that there was Allah first and
nothing else.   Then, He created the water and the Throne (
Arsh
).   They
were created independent of any angels and were created before the creation of the
heavens and the earth.   Prophet Muhammad said, “There was Allah, and there was
nothing else besides Him, and His Throne was over the wat0er.   He wrote all
things in the Book (in heaven) and He created the heavens and the eart0h.”
[3]
All stars,
planets, galaxies comes under the “first heaven” (
As-sama ad-dunya
).
God mentions many times in the Quran that He is the Lord
of the Glorious Throne, because it is one of the foremost and most magnificent
of his creations.
Description
of the Throne
1.  Allah Created His Throne Above Water
Allah said, “
And
He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne
was on the water.”
(Quran 11:7)
2.  Throne is the Roof of Paradise
The Prophet said:
“If you ask Allah, then ask him the (Paradise of)
Firdaws
,
for it is in the highest point of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the
Most Merciful, and from it burst the rivers of Paradise.”
[4]
3.  Throne is Above the Heavens & Above
All Creation
Abdullah Ibn Masud, a Companion of the
Prophet, said, “Between the lowest heaven and the one after it is the distance
of five hundred years, and between every two heavens is the distance of five
hundred years, and between the seventh heaven and the
Kursi
is the
distance of five hundred years, and between the
Kursi
and the water is
the distance of five hundred years, and the Throne (
Arsh
) is above the
water.  Allah the Almighty is above the Throne.  And nothing is hidden from
Allah of your deeds.”
[5]
4.  Throne has Pillars
The Prophet said:
“The people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection
and I will be the first to gain consciousness, and behold, I will find Musa
clinging to one of the pillars of the Throne.  Then I will not know whether he
regained consciousness before me or he has been exempted because of his
unconsciousness at the mountain of Toor (at Sinai).”
[6]
)
5.  Angels Who Carry It
Allah said:
“Those
(angels) who bear the Throne and those around it glorify the praises of their
Lord.”
(Quran 40:7)
He also said:
“And
the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the
Throne of your Lord above them.”
(Quran 69:17)
Moreover, Allah talks about the great angels that carry
the Throne.  They are huge magnificent creatures from the best of Allah’s
angels.  On the Day of Judgement, Allah tells us there will be eight angels
that will bear His Throne (Quran 69:17).  The Prophet said, “I was permitted to
speak about one of the angels of Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, who is
one of the"

- the Preserved

Jinn
- A creation of Allah that was

The Pen
After the creation of the water and the Throne, God
created the Pen.  When the Prophet says that God created the Pen, he says that
His Throne was settled upon water, that there was a layer of water under the
Throne of God.
“God ordained the measures of the creation fifty thousand
years before He created the heavens and the earth while His Throne was over the
water.”
[1]
What are the dimensions of the Pen?  How does it look?  We
have absolutely no idea.
The Prophet said, “God said to the Pen: ‘Write.’ It
said: ‘O Lord, what should I write?’ He said: ‘Write down the decrees of all
things until the Hour begins.’”
[2]
The Preserved Tablet (
Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
)
The Pen, which was created 50,000 years before the
heavens and the earth, wrote in what’s known as
al-Lawh al-Mahfuz
, the
Preserved Tablet.  God calls it
al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
because it’s protected
from any changes and is also protected from access.  Everything is within that
Book, even, as God tells us, a leaf falling from the tree.  Everything that
would have happened, that has happened, and will happen is written there.
What it does is it establishes the trust of a believer
in Allah that what He wrote was written for our good, and that everything
happens for a wisdom.  Sometimes we can figure it out, but at other times we
are comforted and content knowing that God knows what He is doing.
Heavens and Earth
Referring to what scientists call the Big Bang today,
the Quran says,
“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and
the earth were joined together as one piece, then We parted them and We have
made from water every living thing? Will they not then believe?”
(Quran
21:30)
Based on the following verse, some scholars state that Allah
created the heavens before He created the earth,
“Are you more difficult to
create or is the heaven that He constructed.  He raised its height, and has
perfected it.  Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.  And after
that He spread the earth.  And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture. 
And the mountains He has fixed firmly, as provision and benefit for you and
your cattle.”
(Quran 79:27-30)
Allah says in the Quran,
“Indeed, your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the
earth in six days.” (Quran 7:54)
Allah really does not need six days, God could simply
have said, “Be,” and it would have come into existence.  Why would God create
in six days as opposed to just one second or less? Perhaps, God wanted to teach
us one of the beloved qualities to Him, which is to take things slowly and
planning them out properly.
Seas, Rivers, & Rain
Allah tells us that He is the One who created the
heavens and the earth, sent down rain from the sky, producing fruits and
sustenance for our survival.  Allah provided for us seas and ships to sail
through these seas.  He put the rivers at our service and placed the sun and
the moon in their circuits.  He put for our service the night and the day.  Allah
says that He gave us everything that we need to survive.  If we were to try to
count the blessings of Allah, we would not be able to do so (see Quran
14:32-34).
The earth benefits us in innumerable ways.   If you look
at the surface of the earth, Allah says He made it special for us, meaning that
it is ease to tread.  Now imagine if the surface of the earth was all like
mountains and we all had to live in regions that were rough and difficult to
walk.  He made the surface soft so we can dig into it and plant things.  But at
the same time, He made the earth stable and firm enough to allow construction
and building from its materials.  He also created gravity so we’re not just
flying all over the place.
Sun & Moon
The sun is a magnificent creation of Allah and you will
find that Allah swears by the sun in Chapter Ash-Shams in order to bestow
greater appreciation for this gift that He gave us.  Many religions in the past
assigned special qualities to the sun; a lot of people worshipped the sun.  Allah
says,
“And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. 
Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostate to God, who created
them, if you [really] worship Him.” (Quran 41:37)
With the sun, moon, and the stars you have a lot of
superstitions and even rational human beings will have these very strange
superstitions.  People often put logic aside when it comes to superstitions. 
You have astrology, horoscopes and other similar things that make absolutely no
sense, but they give people either hope that’s not really there or they give
people a reason for t"

Hadith
- (plural –

) is
a piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
The human mind is a true marvel, but in certain areas it
is limited.  Allah is different from anything the human mind can think of or
imagine.  Therefore, if the mind tries to picture Allah, certain aspects will
be ambiguous and open to indefinite interpretation.  Nevertheless, it is
possible to understand the attributes of Allah which do not require making any
mental pictures.  For example, one of Allah’s names is
al-Ghaffar
, which
means ‘Oft-Forgiver’.  Everyone can understand this easily because that is how
the human mind can clearly think of Allah.  Jewish and Christian teachings on
God are confused partly because of their incorrect understanding of this issue. 
The Jewish Torah teaches God is like man:
“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness…so God made man in His own image.’ (Genesis 1:26-27)
Moreover, certain Christians put statues or images of an
old white bearded man depicting God in their churches.  Some of these were  produced
by the likes of Michelangelo, who depicted the Face and Hand ‘of God’ – a tough
looking old man - in paintings.
Rendering images of God in Islam is an impossibility,
and amounts to disbelief, as Allah tells us in the Quran that nothing resembles
Him:
“There is nothing like Him, but He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.”
(Quran 42:11)
“There is nothing comparable to Him.” (Quran 112:4)
The Request of Moses to See Allah
Eyes can not grasp Allah, He tells us in the Quran:
“Vision cannot grasp Him, but He his grasp is over all vision.”
(Quran 6:103)
Moses, to whom God spoke and gave great miracles, was
chosen by Allah to be His Prophet.  It is said, that Moses thought that, since
Allah used to speak to him, he might be able to actually see Allah if he asked. 
The story is in the Quran, where Allah tells us what happened:
“And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord
spoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show me (Yourself) that I may look at You.’  (Allah)
said, ‘You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in
place, then you will see Me.’  But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He
rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious.  And when he awoke, he said,
‘Exalted are You!  I have repented to You, and I am the first of the
believers.’” (Quran 7:143)
Allah made it clear that no one, including the great
prophet Moses, can bear the sight of the divine, for Allah is too great to be grasped
by human eyes in this life.  According to the Quran, Moses realized his request
was in error; therefore, he sought forgiveness from Allah for having even
thought to ask.
The Prophet Muhammad Did Not See Allah in This Life
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, traveled in a miraculous journey through the heavens to meet Allah. 
People thought that since Prophet Muhammad spoke to Allah in that journey, he
probably saw Allah too.  One of the companions, Abu Dharr, asked him about it. 
The Prophet replied:
“There was only light, how could I see Him?’
[1]
What was the light he saw?  The Prophet explained:
“Surely, Allah does not sleep nor is it befitting
for Him to sleep.  He is the one who lowers the scales and raises them.  The
deeds of the night go up to Him before the deeds of the day and those of the
day before those of the night, and His veil is the light.”
[2]
Vision of God in Spiritual Experiences
Some people, including some who claim to be Muslims,
report spiritual experiences where they have claimed to have seen God.  Common
reported experiences also include seeing lights, or a magnificent being seated
on a throne.  Such an experience is usually accompanied by dropping basic
Islamic practices like
salah
and fasting, under the mistaken opinion
that such practices are only for common people who had not had their type of
experience.
One of the fundamental foundations of Islam is that the
law revealed to Prophet Muhammad cannot be changed or canceled.  God neither
makes lawful for some what He has made unlawful for others, nor does He communicate
His Law thro"

·
Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a
direct connection between the believer and Allah.  More specifically, in Islam
it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
The Merciful Creator describes Himself in the Quran, and
the Prophet has described His Lord in the
Sunnah
, because human
intellect is limited and cannot fathom the limitless scope of the divine.  Allah
tells us what is necessary for us to know about Himself, helping to prevent
confusion about His being, actions and location.  After all, how can we love
someone we do not know?  Therefore, the Quran and
Sunnah
tell us
everything we need to know in order to worship our Creator.  The divine
attribute of
‘Uluw
, highness or transcendence, is the topic of this
lesson.
Meaning and Significance
The divine attribute
‘Uluw
means Allah is above
His creation, and nothing is above Him.  He is neither within His creation, nor
part of His creation.  Creation cannot encompass Him.  The Creator is
completely separate and distinct from His creation.
Before Islam, Hindus believed God resided in animals,
human beings and countless idols.  The Jewish scripture stated that God came to
earth in the form of a man and wrestled with Prophet Jacob who defeated Him (Genesis
32:24-30).  Christians have claimed that God became flesh and came down to
earth in the form of a man to be crucified.  Some heretics also brought such ideas
into Islam.  For example, Hallaj, a deranged mystic, openly claimed he and
Allah were one.  These deviant ideas have become so widespread that if someone
were to ask many Muslims today, ‘Where is Allah?’ they will say that He is
everywhere.
The main danger of this thought is that it opens the
door to the worship of creation.  If God is everywhere, it means He is in His
creation.  If that is true, then why not worship the creation itself?  It
becomes especially easy for people to start saying God is in their own souls and
accept worship.  Countless kings, ordinary individuals like the Pharaohs of
Egypt and Jesus were so worshipped, though the latter did not accept being
worshipped by his followers.
The Evidence
Allah is not everywhere.  There are five main proofs for
it:
(1)  Islam states that every human being is born
with certain tendencies that are not the result of his environment.  Human
beings are born with a natural realization of a Creator who is separate and
above His creation.  The mere thought of God being in places of filth, which
would be a natural consequence of God being everywhere, is repulsive to human
nature.
(2)  The
salah
prayer must be offered in a
place clear of pictures or statues.  A Muslim is forbidden to bend or prostrate
in worship to any creation.  If Allah were everywhere and in everything, people
could worship other people or themselves.
(3)  Two years before the Prophet, may the mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon him, migrated to Medina from Mecca, he was taken
on a miraculous journey to Mecca to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem up beyond the
seven heavens to meet Allah.  Allah spoke directly to Prophet Muhammad.  There would
have been no need for him to go up beyond the seven heavens to meet Allah if He
were present everywhere.
(4)  Many verses of the Quran tell us clearly that
Allah is above His creation.
The Quran speaks of the angels rising up to Allah:
“They ascend up to Him in a day whose length is like a
thousand years by your reckoning.” (Quran 32:5)
Prayers also rise up to Allah:
“Every good saying goes up to Him.” (Quran 35:10)
Allah describes Himself as above His servants:
“He is the Irresistible One above His creation.” (Quran 6:18,
61)
He describes His worshippers as:
“Those who fear their Lord who is above them.” (Quran 16:50)
One of Allah’s beautiful names is al-Aliy which means, ‘The
Most High’; nothing is above Him.
(5)  A companion of the Prophet, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, named Ibn al-Hakam had a slave who used to tend
his sheep.  One day, he came to see her and found out that a wolf had eaten one
of the sheep from the flock she cared for.  Learning this, he got angry and
slapped her in the face, but later  regretted doing so. So he came to Allah’s
Messenger and told him the story, upon which the Messenger asked him to bring
her.
When
she came, the Prophet asked her,
‘Where is Allah?’
She answered, ‘Above
the sky.’  The Prophet asked her,
‘Who am I?’
She said, ‘You are the
Messenger of Allah.’  He said,
‘Free her, for she is a believer.’

Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem
.  I begin with the
name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.  This is a phrase that we
say every day, several times per day.  However sometimes we forget how mighty a
phrase it is and we forget that mercy is one of His attributes, and that we, as
imperfect human beings, constantly rely upon Allah’s blessings.
Allah is the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful, His
mercy encompasses all things, and is the source of all the compassion and mercy
that exists.
“My Mercy embraces all things...” (Quran 7:156)
In English the word mercy has several meanings including
compassion, forgiveness, kindness, and tenderness.  In Arabic, the term for
mercy is
rahmah
;
Ar-Rahman
and
Ar-Raheem
, two of the most
important names of Allah derive from this root word.  The Mercy of Allah is
that ethereal quality that also embodies gentleness, care, consideration, love
and forgiveness.   When these qualities are observable in this world, they are
a mere reflection of Allah’s mercy towards His creation.
Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him, informed us that
Allah is more merciful to His slaves than a mother is to her child,
[1]
and in fact,
the Arabic word for womb, is derived from the same root word as mercy -rahmah. 
 This is a sign of the unique connection between Allah’s mercy and the womb.   Allah
nurtures and shelters us, just as the womb nurtures and shelters the unborn
child.  In the Quran, in the authentic Sunnah and throughout the world there
are many signs of Allah’s mercy to His creation.
Some Signs of Allah’s Mercy
·The Prophets and Messengers.
Allah sent Prophets and Messengers to guide us and help
us to remain on His straight path leading to eternal Paradise.  All the
Prophets and Messengers were mortal, human beings, sent to different nations at
different times but proclaimed the same message – to worship One God
and not to associate anything or
anyone with Him
.  They showed the people the best way to live and
lead a life that would give them success and happiness in this life and in the
next.
Prophet Muhammad being the last of them, was sent to all
of humankind.
He was
sent with a message that was suitable for all people, in all places, at all
times
.
Allah describes the Prophet  as
a mercy upon humankind. He, the Exalted, says:
“And We have not sent you, (O Muhammad), except as a mercy to
the worlds.” (Quran 21:107)
Prophet Muhammad was the embodiment of mercy.   He
showed gentleness and compassion to all those he came in contact with; his
family, orphans, friends, slaves, and strangers.
“And by the Mercy of God, you dealt with them gently.   And
had you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about
you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah’s) Forgiveness for them...”
(Quran 3:159)
·The Quran
The Quran is Allah’s greatest gift to humanity – it is a
book like no other.  The Quran guides humankind to high standards of morality
and exhorts them to strive to be the best human beings possible.   Whenever
life becomes too difficult or we are beset by injury, illness or unhappiness, the
Quran will light our way and lighten our burdens.   It is a source of solace
and ease.  It is a mercy to humankind.
“And We have not sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (O
Muhammad), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which
they differ, and (as) a guidance and a
mercy
for a people who believe.”
(Quran 16:64)
“And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’an) which We have sent
down, so follow it and fear Allah (i.e.  do not disobey His Orders), that you
may receive mercy.”(Quran 6:155)
·Leniencies in matters of worship.
Islam teaches that every
single aspect of life can be an act of worship.  Everything from eating and
drinking to sleeping and going to the bathroom can be done in a way that
pleases Allah.
Islam is a faith that is flexible, lenient and merciful.
For instance, if a believer is sick and cannot fast
during the month of Ramadan, he is not mandated to fast.  In fact he is
encouraged to not fast.  Similarly if a Muslim cannot make the
Hajj
due
to physical or financial difficulties he or "

More signs of Allah’s Mercy
·Rain
While rain can sometimes be a reminder of God’s
punishment, it is a true blessing and a mercy of the highest order.  Without
rain, life as we know it would not exist.  All power and strength is from God
Alone and He reminds us of that in the Quran.  God is Almighty, with total
control over rain and its bounties.
“And We sent down from the sky water (rain) in (due) measure…”
(Quran 23:18)
“And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have
despaired, and spreads His Mercy.  And He is the
Wali
, Worthy of all
Praise.” (Quran 42:28)
·Life everlasting in Paradise.
It is the mercy of Allah that will admit the believers into
Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.  No one will ever enter Paradise because
of his deeds alone.  Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him, explained that to
his companions saying, “No one’s deeds will ever admit him to Paradise.” They
said, “Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “No, not even me, unless
Allah showers me with His Mercy.
[1]
However it is the good deeds of a person that draws Allah’s Mercy.
Mercy and all it involves is a very important concept in
Islam because from it stems generosity, respect, tolerance and forgiveness; all
qualities that a Muslim is expected to cultivate in this life.  Because of this
Islam places great emphasis on developing the qualities of compassion,
sympathy, forgiveness, and love.   Both the Quran and the
Sunnah
of
Prophet Muhammad display and encourage these ideals.  Allah blesses Muslims who
are kind to others and dislikes behaviour that is hard hearted or cruel.  Consequently
Prophet Muhammad could often be heard invoking God’s Mercy on the believers.
Mercy & Forgiveness
Allah’s mercy should never be underestimated and the qualities
of mercy and forgiveness are linked together throughout the Quran and the
authentic traditions - the
Sunnah
- of Prophet Muhammad.  Allah asks us
to seek forgiveness from Him and Prophet Mohammad reminded us that God forgives
when we turn to Him.   In the last part of the night, when darkness lies
heavily across the land, God descends to the lowest heaven and asks His slaves. 
“Who is saying a prayer to Me that I may answer it?  Who is asking something of
Me that I may give it to him?  Who is asking forgiveness of Me that I may
forgive him?”
[2]
“Say, ‘O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves
[by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah.  Indeed, Allah forgives all
sins.  Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.’ And return [in
repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you;
then you will not be helped.” (Quran 39: 53 – 54)
Allah created humankind with an inclination to commit
sins and make mistakes, however when a person repents he or she is able to see
and experience Allah’s divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness.  Prophet
Muhammad said, “If you did not commit sins, Allah would wipe you out of
existence and replace with another people who would commit sins and in turn
seek Allah’s forgiveness.
[3]
Falling into error, realizing the mistake, and seeking Allah’s forgiveness
whilst hoping for His mercy, is spiritual growth that develops a person’s love
for Allah.  Allah loves those who constantly turn to Him seeking forgiveness.
Although Allah is eager for all human beings to turn to Him
and ask forgiveness, and although His mercy is vast and all-encompassing, this
is not a license to commit sins.  In order for a person to feel the mercy of
Allah and be forgiven for his or her transgressions, the conditions of
repentance should be fulfilled
[4]
. 
Then and only then will the mercy of Allah descend.
The mercy of Allah is made manifest when Allah counts
the sin of the sinner as one sin.  It is further manifested when Allah rewards
the righteous person ten times what his good deed is worth and then Allah may multiply
his reward even more than ten times.  “Allah ordered (the appointed angels over
you) that the good and the bad deeds be written, and He then showed (the way)
how (to write).  If someone intends to do a good deed and he does not do it,
then Allah will write for him a full good deed; and if he intends to do a good
deed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him (its reward equal) from
ten to seven hundred times to many more times.  And If someone intends to do a
bad deed and he does not do it, then Allah will write for him a full good deed
(in his account) with Him, and if he intends to do a bad deed and actually did
it, then Allah will write for him one bad deed.”
[5]
Also, Allah erases sins with each good deed performed.

deeds r"

Tawheed
– The Oneness and Uniqueness

right to be worshipped.
·
Shirk
– a word that
implies ascribing partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other
than Allah, or believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes
from another besides Allah.
·
Tiyarah
– Taking omen through bird’s
movements or things.
An omen is defined as a sign portending a future event. 
Some omens are taken as signs of good fortune while others are interpreted as a
sign of impending evil.  Many superstitions in the name of good and bad omens
are widespread in the world, and a Muslim should have a clear understanding as to
how it affects their belief.  Omens are not meaningless little things people
just believe in; rather, they are based on pagan, non-Islamic ideas.  One
should keep in mind that idolatry did not appear overnight.  Rather, such
superstitions first take root and open the door to the worship of idols, human
gods, and stars.  Slowly people forget the pure teachings of their prophets –
tawheed
- and mixed them with superstitions.  Islam closes all such doors and uproots
every superstition that can destroy the simple, pure belief in
tawheed
.
The following are a few examples of numerous widespread omens:
(1)  Breaking a mirror means suffering seven years
of bad luck: before the invention of mirrors, man would gaze at his reflection,
perceived as his ‘other self’, in pools, ponds, and lakes. If the image was
distorted, it was taken as a sign of impending disaster. Thus the ‘unbreakable’
metal mirrors of the early Egyptians and Greeks were valued items because of
their magical properties (such as possessing undistorted reflecting properties).
After glass mirrors were introduced, the Romans took the broken mirror as a
sign of bad luck, since each piece reflected and multiplied their ‘other self’.
The length of the prescribed misfortune came from the Roman belief that man's
body was physically rejuvenated every 7 years, and he became, in effect, a new
man.
(2) Knocking on wood: the ancient belief that
spirits either dwelled in, or guarded trees.  Greeks worshipped the oak as it
was sacred to Zeus, Celts believed in tree spirits, and both believed touching
sacred trees would bring good fortune.  Irish lore holds that ‘touching wood’ is
a way to thank the leprechauns for a bit of luck.  Pagans also held similar
beliefs of protective tree spirits.  Chinese and Koreans thought the spirits of
mothers who died in childbirth remained in nearby trees.  Another explanation
points to the wooden Christian cross as the origin of  ‘good luck,’ although
this is likely a Christian adaptation of earlier pagan practices.
(3)  The inadvertent spilling of salt is believed
to be followed by misfortune, so it is deliberately spilled, or cast, over the
left shoulder to counter it.  Superstitions about salt date back to biblical
times when salt was a highly prized commodity.  It was expensive, crucial in
preserving food, and was often used in place of currency.  So spilling salt was
considered an almost sacrilegious offence, and left one exposed to the devil's
machinations.  Throwing salt over your shoulder is thought to be a way of
keeping the devil at bay while you are in especially vulnerable.  The salt is
either intended to blind the devil so he can not witness your error, or keep
him from sneaking up on you while you are cleaning up the mess.
(4)  Friday 13
th
: Western culture has
considered Friday 13th particularly unlucky for hundreds of years.  The 13
th
floor in many high-rise buildings in America is called the 14
th
floor.  The sixth day of the week has often been considered unlucky, as has the
number 13.  The combination, which occurs one to three times a year, leads inevitably
to this reinforced superstition.
People
avoid traveling on this day. Some say the number 13 was purposely vilified by
the priests of patriarchal religions because it represented femininity.  Thirteen
corresponded to the number of lunar (menstrual) cycles in a year, and the
number was revered in prehistoric goddess-worshipping cultures.  Hindus
believed that it was unlucky for 13 people to gather in one place.  This
conviction was shared by the ancient Scandinavians.  Many biblical events of
negative import supposedly occurred on a Friday, including the ejection of Adam
and Eve from the Garden of Eden, the start of the Great Flood, and the purported
crucifixion of Jesus.
Islamic Ruling on Omens
Before Islam the Arabs used to consider the direction in
which birds flew to be a sign of good or bad omen.  If a person set out on a
journey and saw a bird fly over"

·
Ruqyah
– spells.
For thousands of years people have tried to bring good
luck and avert bad luck from them and their property by employing charms,
amulets, and talismans.  A charm is a practice or expression believed to have
magic power, similar to an incantation or a spell.
[1]
A talisman is an object bearing a sign or engraved character, and thought to
act as a charm to avert evil and bring good fortune.
[2]
Amulets were used to protect man, or his possessions, such as houses and
cattle from the evil influences of witches, demons, and other mischievous
powers, or to counteract misfortune and illness.  The amulet is found both in
the Orient and in the West, among tribes and nations down to the present day.  Assyrians
and Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, Jews and Christians, fostered this ancient
superstition, and, in varying degrees, foster it today.
[3]
Despite technical and scientific advancements, superstitions and amulets continue
to pervade the Western society.  Some of the amulets popular in the West are:
(1)  A horseshoe.  The most commonly encountered
lucky charm in modern North America is the horseshoe and its representative
models in the form of jewelry, wall hangings, and printed images.  The use of
worn-out horseshoes as magically protective amulets - especially hung above or
next to doorways - originated in Europe, where one can still find them nailed
onto houses, barns, and stables from Italy through Germany and up into Britain
and Scandinavia.
(2)  The four-leaf clover.  The four-leaf clover is
among the commonest of North American lucky emblems and is an especially
frequent image on good luck coins, and good luck postcards.
(3)  The wishbone or “merry thought.”  The wishbone
is the third most popular American amulet, next only to the horseshoe and the
four-leaf clover.  It is a bone overlying the breastbone of fowl, as in a chicken,
or turkey.  It is the custom to save this bone intact when carving the bird at
dinner and to dry it over the stove or by the fire until it is brittle.  Once
dry, it is given to two people, who pull it apart until it cracks, each one making
a wish while doing so.  The person who gets the “long half” of the wishbone
will have his or her wish “come true.”  If the wishbone breaks evenly, both
parties get their wishes.
(4)  The Rabbit’s Foot.
(5)  Charm bracelets.
(6)  Good Luck coins or ‘pocket pieces.’
(7)  The Lucky or Smiling Buddha commonly found in Oriental
shops and restaurants.
The Crucifix.  When blessed, it is considered an important
sacramental.
Hebrew Amulets: Grape-Leaf Star of David pendant.  One of
its ancient uses was as a magical Kabalistic symbol.
Charms & Amulets in Pre-Islamic Arabia
Arabian amulets (
tameemah
in Arabic) are made
from pearls or bones that are worn on the necks of children or adults, or are
hung up in houses or cars, in order to ward off evil – especially the evil eye
– or to bring some benefits.  The Arabs in the time of Prophet Muhammad, may
the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, used to wear arm bracelets,
bangles, beaded necklaces, shells, and similar amulets to bring good luck or
avert bad fortune.
Islamic Ruling on Amulets
Allah is the sole Lord and Ruler of the physical world. 
‘Lord’ means He is the Creator and controls all affairs in the universe; the
Kingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs exclusively to Him, and He owns them. 
He alone brought existence out of non-existence and it depends on Him for its
conservation and continuance.  His power is required at every moment to sustain
all creatures.  Angels, prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant
kingdoms are under His control.  Only Allah knows what the future holds.  Good
luck and bad fortune are from Allah alone.
Faith in charms, amulets, and talismans contradict
belief in Allah’s Lordship by attributing the ability to bring good luck or
avert bad fortune to these created brings whereas only Allah can bring good and
avert harm.  Consequently, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, opposed these superstitious practices and taught people to have firm
belief in their Lord, rather than amulets, which cannot change what Allah has
destined and can bring no good fortune to anyone.  Even though they are not
capable of averting any harm, belief in amulets usually leads to idolatry over
time.  This can be s"

to the Prophet, related the following occurrence:
“Once, while we were
sitting with the Prophet, a man appeared before us whose clothes were
exceedingly white and hair exceedingly black.  No signs of traveling were seen
on him and no one among us knew him.  He sat towards the Prophet, resting his
knees against his knees and placing the palms of his hands on his thighs. He then
said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’
The Messenger replied: ‘Islam
is to testify that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad
is the Messenger of Allah, to perform the prayers, to pay the compulsory
charity (
zakah
), to fast in
Ramadan
, and to make the pilgrimage
to the House if you are able to do so.’
He said: ‘You have spoken the
truth.’
We were amazed at him
asking questions and then saying he had spoken the truth!
He then inquired: ‘Tell me
about faith (
Imaan
)?’
The Prophet replied: ‘It
is to believe in Allah, His angels, His scriptures, His messengers, and the
Last Day, and to believe in divine decree, both its sweetness and its bitterness.’
He said: ‘You have spoken the
truth.’
Umar then related some more
questions he asked and the answers given by the Prophet.  Finally, when the man
left, the Prophet asked:
‘O ‘Umar, do you know who
was the questioner?’
I said: ‘Allah and His
Messenger know best.’
The Prophet said: ‘It was
Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.’”

The Meaning of ‘Islam’
The Arabic word
‘Islam
’
means to submit, a total surrender, a total resignation to God.  Therefore, a
‘Muslim’ is ‘one who submits to God.’ Islam means to submit to Allah alone, to
worship and serve Allah alone, and to believe and follow the prophet sent to
them.  To many non-Muslims, ‘Islam’ is a religion that began in the seventh
century in the Middle East, but to Muslims, Islam has always been the only
religion of Allah since the time of Adam, the first man.  Thus, Islam was the
religion of all prophets who came after him.  In the time of Moses, Islam was
to worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings Moses had brought,
and Islam in the time of Jesus was to worship Allah alone and believe and
follow the teachings Jesus had brought, as they were both prophets sent by God
to teach his religion.  After the coming of Prophet Muhammad, Islam is to
worship Allah alone and believe and follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.
Although the teachings of all the prophets about God, the Afterlife, and all
other realities of belief were the same, there were slight differences in the
methods of practice, worship and service, for each prophet was sent to a
specific nation and specific period of time. Even though previous religions
come under the general heading of Islam, the religion of Muhammad has specifically
been given the name ‘Islam’ by God, as it is the final religion prescribed for
humanity until the Day of Judgment.
The Five Pillars of Islam
Allah has mandated five acts upon
which the whole religion of Islam is built. Due to their importance, the
Prophet stated in another
hadith
:
“Islam has been built upon
five…”
…and
then proceeded to mention the same acts of worship described in the
hadith
of Gabriel above.
These acts
of worship are called the Pillars of Islam, and they are as follows:
1. Testimony of faith (

One
must profess this testimony of faith, summarized in the two testimonies:

- faith, belief or conviction.
The Six Articles of Faith
Faith is referred to in Arabic
as
Imaan
.  It represents firm belief in the heart, and not simply
blind faith. Islamic doctrine revolves around six aspects described by the
Prophet.
1. Belief in Allah
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief in Allah’s
existence.
(ii)  Allah is the Lord.
He is the Creator, the Provider, the Sustainer, and the Owner of the entire
universe. None has any share in these roles.
(iii) Allah is the only
being entitled to worship. No worship, service or veneration is to be offered
to others besides Allah or along with Him, whether they be prophets, priests,
saints, angels, idols, or stones.
(iv) Allah has the most
beautiful and perfect of names and attributes, which none can be compared to. He
is Unique, separate and unlike His creation. No evil or deficiency can be
attributed to Him.
2. Belief in the Angels
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief in the existence
of angels, a creation of Allah.
(ii)  Belief that they
have no right to receive any form of worship
(iii) Belief in the names by
which the angels are identified in the Quran and
Sunnah
(teachings of
Prophet Muhammad).
(iv) Belief in the special
tasks assigned to each of them by Allah in the Quran and
Sunnah
(teachings of Prophet Muhammad).
3. Belief in the Revealed Scriptures
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief that Allah
revealed scriptures to various prophets.
(ii)  Belief that they
contained the truth from Allah.
(iii) Belief that all
previous scriptures other than the Quran have been altered.
(iv) Belief in the Quran has
several aspects:
a)
Belief that it is one of the scriptures of Allah.
b)
Belief that it is the Final Revelation to humanity, and that no other scripture
will be revealed after it.
c)
Belief that everything in it is true, containing no falseness.
d)
Belief that it has remained unchanged, and will remain so for eternity.
e)
Belief that it has abrogated all previous scriptures before it.
4. Belief in the Messengers
, which entails the following:
(i)    Belief that Allah sent prophets to every nation, calling them
to worship and obey Allah Alone. One must believe in all of them, known or
unknown, without rejecting any of them.
(ii)   Belief that they were the best of humanity, chosen due to
their virtuousness.
(iii)  Belief that they were mere humans, not divine in any way, and
that they do not have any right to receive worship, nor did they claim so.
(iv)  Belief that they merely conveyed the message from Allah and
did not legislate from their own selves.
(v)   Belief that they did not err in conveying the message.
(vi)  Belief that obedience to them is a must.
(vi)  Belief that Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, was a prophet, which entails those issues discussed in the lesson
entitled
The Testimony of Faith
.
5. Belief in Life after Death and
the Final Day of Judgment, which
entails the following:
(i)   Belief that a day
will come when everything will come to an end, and Allah will raise the
creation and judge them according to their deeds.
(ii) Belief that those who
believed and practically followed the correct religion by following the
prophets will enter Paradise for eternity, and that those who disbelieved will
enter the Hellfire for eternity.
6.       Belief in Divine Decree
, which entails the following:
(i)   Belief that Allah’s
Foreknowledge is all inclusive and complete. He has always known everything
that would or would not happen, even before the creation of mankind.
(ii)  Belief that Allah
has recorded everything that was going to occur until the Day of Judgment in a book
known as “The Mother of the Books” or “The Preserved Tablet”.
(iii) Belief that whatever
Allah willed has occurred, is occurring, and will occur. Nothing occurs against
or without this Will.
(iv) Allah created
everything.
We have mentioned here the
minimal requirements of faith in each of these six categories that Muslims
believe in, as the Prophet mentioned that these articles form the basis of Islamic
belief and faith.

– The Oneness and
Uniqueness of Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and
in His right to be worshipped.

Sunnah
- The word

Shirk
– a word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
Belief in Allah, the proper name in Arabic of
the one and only God, consists of four matters:
(a)  Belief in Allah’s existence.
(b)  Allah is the Lord.
(c)  Allah is entitled to worship.
(d)  Allah is known by His Most Beautiful
Names and Attributes.
(a)    Belief in Allah’s Existence
It is not required that Allah’s existence be
proven by scientific, mathematical, or philosophical arguments.  His existence
is not a ‘discovery’ to be made by the scientific method or a mathematical
theorem to be proven.  Every human being has an innate belief in a Creator.  This
belief is not a result of learning or personal deductive thinking.  It is outside
influences that effect this innate belief and confuse a person as the Prophet
said:
“There is no child who is not born with a
natural belief in Allah, but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian or a
Magian.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Also, mere common sense bears witness to Allah’s
existence.  From a ship one learns of the ship-builder, from the cosmos one
learns of its Creator.  Allah’s existence is also known by answers to prayers, the
miracles of prophets, and the teachings of all revealed scriptures.
(b)    Allah is the Lord
Allah is the only Lord of heaven and earth.  He
is the Lord of the physical universe and the Lawgiver for human life.  He is
the Master of the physical world and Ruler of the affairs of men.  Allah is the
Lord of every man, woman, and child.
(i)   Allah is the sole Lord and Ruler of
the physical world.  The term ‘Lord’ here specifically means that He is the
Creator, Controller; the Kingdom of the heaven and the earth belongs
exclusively to Him, and He owns them.  He alone brought existence out of
non-existence and all depend on Him for their conservation and continuance.  He
did not create the universe and leave it to pursue its own course according to
fixed laws and cease to take any further interest in it.  His power is required
at every moment to sustain all creatures.  Creation has no Lord besides Him.
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky
and the earth?  Or who owns hearing and sight?  And who brings out the living
from the dead and brings out the dead from the living?  And who disposes the
affairs?’  They will say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s
punishment (for setting up rivals with Allah)?’” (Quran 10:31)
He is the ever-ruling King and the Savior, the
Living God, full of wisdom.  No one can change His decisions.  Angels,
prophets, human beings, and the animal and plant kingdoms are under His control. 
Historically, few people have denied the existence of the Lord; throughout ages
people for most part have believed in One God, a Supreme Being, a supernatural
Creator.
(ii)  Allah is the only Ruler of the
affairs of men.  Allah is the supreme Lawgiver
[1]
,
the Absolute Judge, the Legislator, He distinguishes right from wrong.  Just
like the physical world submits to its Lord, human beings must submit to the
moral and religious teaching of their Lord, the Lord who sets apart right from
wrong for them.  In other words, Allah alone has the authority to make laws,
determine acts of worship, decide morals, and set standards of human
interaction and behavior.  His is the command:
“His is the Creation and Command.” (Quran 7:54)
(c) Allah is Entitled to Worship
Allah has the exclusive right to be worshipped
inwardly and outwardly, by one’s actions and by one’s heart.  Not only can no
one be worshipped
apart
from Him, absolutely no one else can be
worshipped
along
with
Him.  He has no partners or associates in
worship.  Worship, in its comprehensive sense and in all its aspects, is for
Him alone.
“There is no true god worthy of worship but He, the
Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.” (Quran 2:163)
Allah’s right to be worshipped can not be over
emphasized.  It is the essential meaning of
Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah
.  A
non-Muslim enters Islam by testifying to Allah’s sole right to be worshipped.  It
is the crux of Islamic belief in Allah, even all of Islam.  It was the central
message of all prophets and messengers sent by Allah.  They all declared
clearly:
“Worship Allah!  You have no other god but Him.” (Quran 7:59, 11: 50, 23:32)
It was the central message of Abraham, Isaac,
Ishmael, Moses, the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, and Muhamma"

prevalent in our societies.

believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
·
Du’a
- supplication, prayer, asking
Allah for something.
·
Riyaa
– It comes from the word
ra’aa
meaning to see, to behold, to view. Thus the word
riyaa
means showing
off, hypocrisy, and dissimulation.  Islamically
riyaa
means to perform
acts which are pleasing to Allah with the intention of pleasing other than
Allah.
The Arabic word
shirk
is the opposite of
tawheed
,
Allah’s oneness, and is more inclusive than polytheism and idolatry.  It means
associating Allah with other deities.
Shirk
is to associate others with
Allah in certain aspects designated as unique to Him and exclusively His in the
Quran and
Sunnah
.
There is no issue upon which Islam is so strict
as the one of monotheism (
tawheed
). Associating partners with God (
shirk
)
is the deadliest sin, the greatest violation with which the Lord of the heavens
and the earth may be defied.  Death in the state of
shirk
permanently severs
a person from divine grace:
“Surely Allah forgives not that a partner be set with
Him (i.e.  the sin of
shirk
), and forgives all besides that to whom he
pleases.” (Quran 4:48)
Shirk
has many forms, some of which will
be discussed below.
The Greater
Shirk
Acts which fall under this category of
shirk
are regarded as unforgivable. Allah will not forgive them unless one repents.
“Verily, Allah does not forgive
shirk
, but He
forgives other than that to whom He pleases”
This category contradicts the very purpose of
creation, as expressed in Allah’s statement:
“I have not created jinn or mankind except to worship
Me Alone.” (Quran 51:56)
In this category of
shirk
, acts of
worship are directed to beings
other than
Allah or
alongside
Him,
as is their rewards.  Allah gives an example of this type in the Quran, in His saying:
“So when they ride in the ships, they call upon Allah,
being sincerely obedient to Him, but when he brings them safe to the land, lo,
they commit
shirk
with Him.” (Quran 29:65)
The Quran stresses in many verses that Allah
does not share His powers with any partner.  It warns those who believe their
idols will intercede for them that they, together with the idols, will become
fuel for Hellfire on the Day of Judgment.
The greater
shirk
includes invoking or
supplicating to a false deity, prophet, angel, saint, idol, or anything besides
Allah.  Christians pray to a man who they believe to share divinity with Allah,
the Prophet of Allah Jesus, peace be upon him.  Catholics direct certain types
of worship to saints, angels, and Mary, which they regard as “veneration”. All
these things are regarded as
shirk
.
It is also considered
shirk
to pray to
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, or to
graves of holy men.
Believing in the legislation of others, whether
governments or religious leaders in opposition to the clear teachings of Islam is
also a major form of
shirk
, as Allah says:
“They (referring to Jews and Christians) took their
rabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah.” (Quran 9:31)
They took them as lords besides Allah not by directly
praying to them, but by willfully accepting their changing the lawful into
prohibited and the forbidden into lawful in Allah’s religion.  They gave them
the authority that only Allah has - to legislate in divine law.
Another form of major
shirk
is giving any
creation a portion of divine love reserved for Allah.
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others
besides Allah as rivals (to Allah).  They love them as they love Allah.  But
those who believe love Allah (more than anything else)...” (Quran 2:165)
Lesser Forms of
Shirk
Swearing by other than Allah and carrying out
religious acts for worldly gain, like showing off or to win favors are two of
the lesser forms of
shirk
.  Allah’s Messenger said:
“The thing I fear for you the most is ‘lesser
shirk
.’ The companions asked ‘Oh!  Messenger of Allah, what is “lesser
shirk
?”
 He replied showing off, for surely Allah will say on the Day of Resurrection
when people are receiving their rewards, ‘Go to those for whom you were showing
off in the material world and see if you can find any reward from them.’” (
Ahmad
,
at-Tabarani
,
al-Baihaqi
)

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
Belief in messengers is a required article of Islamic
faith.
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down
to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers.  Each one believes in Allah,
His Angels, His Books, and His messengers.  (They say,) ‘We make no distinction
between one another of His messengers’” (Quran 2:285)
Allah conveys His message to humanity through messengers. 
They form a link between the humans and the heavens, in the sense that Allah
has chosen them to deliver His message to humanity.  Divine messages were not
conveyed to mankind except through the messengers. It is the system of
communication between the Creator and the created.  Allah does not send the angels
to every single individual, nor does He ‘open the skies’ so people can climb up
to receive the message.  His way of communication is through human messengers who
receive the message through the angels. Allah only sent men as prophets and messengers.
No angels were sent with a message to mankind. He, the Exalted, says:
‘And they say, “Why was there not sent down to him an angel?
But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided; then they
would not be reprieved. And if We had made him [i.e. the Messenger] an angel,
We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with
that in which they cover themselves.’ (6:8-9)
What Does the Belief in the Messengers Entail?
Faith in messengers is to firmly believe Allah chose
morally upright men to bear His message and pass it on to humanity.  Blessed
were those who followed them, wretched were those who refused to obey.  They
faithfully delivered the message, without hiding, altering, or corrupting it.  Rejecting
a messenger is rejecting the One who sent him.  Disobeying a messenger is
disobeying the One who commanded to obey him.
Disbelieving in one messenger is like disbelieving in
all the messengers. In the following verse, Allah, the Exalted, says that the
people of Noah disbelieved in all the messengers, even though they were
commanded only to follow Noah:
‘The people of Noah disbelieved in the messengers.’
(Quran 26:105)
More specifically, belief in messengers means:
(1)  Allah sent to every nation a prophet from
amongst them, to call them to worship Allah alone and to shun false gods.
“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our messengers whom We sent
before you: ‘Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Most
Merciful (that is Allah)?’” (Quran 43:45)
They did not add or omit anything from the Divine
Message.
“Are the messengers charged with anything but to convey
clearly the Message?” (Quran 16:35)
(2)  Belief in those have been specifically
mentioned, such as Muhammad, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Noah, peace be upon them
all.  We hold a general belief in those not mentioned by name as Allah says:
“And indeed, We have sent messengers before you (O Muhammad); of
some of them We have related to you their story.  And of some We have not
related to you their story” (Quran 40:78)
We believe the final messenger was our Prophet Muhammad
and there is no prophet or messenger after him as Allah has said in the Quran:
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the
Messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets.  And Allah is Ever All‑Aware
of everything.” (Quran 33:40)
The Prophet stated categorically:
“There will be no prophet after me.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Previous prophets were sent with laws and commandments
specific to that people in that time. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings
of Allah be upon him, however was sent with a message applicable for all time,
people and places; thus, there is no need for more prophets to come. Another
important reason is that some nations were sent more than one prophet due to the
changes they introduced into the religion. Since God has promised that the
teachings of Prophet Muhammad will never undergo change and will always be preserved
in the original language in their primary sources – the Quran and Sunnah, there
is no need for another prophet.  In the cases of earlier prophets, scriptures were
lost or their message became corrupted to the point that truth was hardly
distinguishable from falsehood.  The message of Prophet Muhammad is clear and
preserved till the end of times.

·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and
Articles of Faith (2 parts).
Objectives
·To understand the purpose of revealing of
scriptures.
·To learn what the ‘Belief in Scriptures’
entails.
·To distinguish between two matters: the
original
Torah, Gospel, and Pslams and the
present day
Bible.
·To appreciate that the Quran is indeed different
from other scriptures in many respects.
Belief in Scriptures is the third article of Islamic
faith.
First, let us look at why they were revealed.
(1)  The scripture revealed to a prophet is a point
of reference to learn the religion and obligations towards Allah and fellow
human beings.  Allah guides human beings by revealing Divine Scriptures through
which they realize the purpose of their creation.
(2)  By referring to it religious disputes and
differences between its followers could be settled.
(3)  The scriptures serve to keep the religion safe
from corruption and deterioration at least for some time after the death of a prophet.
However, the Quran revealed to our Prophet remains safe from corruption till
the end of the time. Allah, the Exalted, says:
‘Indeed, it is We who sent down the message and
indeed, We will be its guardian.’ (15:9)
(4)In
order that Allah’s conclusive argument brought by the messengers against human
beings remains after their death.
“Messengers
as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that humankind should
have no plea against Allah after the messengers. And Allah is Ever All
Powerful, All Wise.” (Quran 4:165)
No one
can plea that the prophets and their messages are no longer in existence as
long as the scriptures are present.
Belief in scriptures entails:
(i)   Allah truly revealed them.
(ii)  Belief in the names of certain scriptures.
(iii) Belief that they contain the truth. As for
the scriptures prior to the Quran, since they have been changed, we believe in
the
original
scriptures that were revealed to the prophets.
(iv) Belief that the Quran is a witness over them
and confirms them. The truth remains one and the same, and thus the Quran
confirms the truth which was in them. As for the laws, the Quran has abrogated
the previous scriptures.
First, a Muslim firmly believes that Divine Scriptures
were revealed by Allah to His messengers to guide mankind.  Muslims believe the
Quran is not the only spoken Word of Allah, but that Allah also spoke to
prophets before Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon
him.
“…and to Moses Allah spoke directly.” (Quran 4:164)
Allah describes true believers are those who:
“…believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad) and
what has been sent down before you.” (Quran 2:4)
The most important and central message of
all
scriptures was to worship Allah alone.
“And we sent never a messenger before you except that we
revealed to him, saying, ‘there is no God but I so worship Me.” (Quran 21:25)
Second, we believe in the scriptures mentioned in the Quran:
(i)   the Quran itself, revealed to Prophet
Muhammad.
(ii)  the Torah (
Taurah
in Arabic) revealed
to Prophet Moses (different from the Old Testament read today).
(iii) the Gospel (

to Prophet Jesus (different from the New Testament read in churches today).
(iv) the Psalms (
Zabur
in Arabic) of David.
(v)  The scriptures (
Suhuf
in Arabic) of
Moses and Abraham.
We have a general belief that there were other
scriptures revealed by Allah whose names and specifics are not known to us.
Thus we cannot definitely affirm that scriptures of other religions prior to
Muhammad other than those mentioned were revealed from Allah.
Third, Muslims believe whatever is true in them and has
not been altered or corrupted in the previous scriptures.  This point will be
elaborated below so it becomes clear and no confusion remains.
Fourth, belief that Allah revealed the Quran as a
witness over the previous scriptures and to confirm them, as Allah says:
“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran)
in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and trustworthy in
highness and a witness over it (old Scriptures)” (Quran 5:48)
Meaning the Quran confirms whatever is true in previous
scriptures and rejects whatever alterations and changes human hands have made
in them, and that the laws brought by the Quran overrule and abrogate any laws brought
by the previous religions.
Original Scriptures & the Bible
We must distinguish between two matters: the
original
Torah, Gospel, and Pslams and the
present day
Bible.  We believe the
originals
were Allah’s revelation, but the
present day
Bible does
not
have
the exact original scripture.
No scripture exists today in the original language it
was revealed in, except the Quran.  The Bible was not revealed in English.  Different
books of today’s Bible are translations of translations and different versions
exist.  These multiple translations were done by people whose knowledge or
honesty is not known.  As a result, some Bibles are bigger than others and "

and tasks of angels.

Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief or
Imaan
in Islam.  It means to:
(i)   believe in the reality of angels
(ii)  the names assigned to the angels
(iii) the tasks and abilities of angels in heavens
and earth.
Reality of Angels
Angels are not ‘good forces of nature’, hologram images,
or illusions.  Neither are angels like a fat cherubic baby with a halo on its
head as often depicted in Christian illustrations.  They are real, created but are
generally hidden from our senses.  They have no divine qualities and are not
God’s associates running different districts of the universe.  Also, they are
not objects to be worshipped or prayed to as they do not intercede for us at
our request, nor do they deliver our prayers to God. 
They all submit to God and carry out His commands.  There are no fallen
angels; they are not divided into ‘good’ and ‘evil’ angels.  Human beings do
not become angels after death.
Angels were created from light before human beings.  The
angels are beautiful beings with wings as described in the Quran.
Angels form different hierarchies and orders in the
sense they are of different size, status, and merit.  The best were those
present at the battle of Badr who fought between the Prophet and the Meccan
pagans.
They are of great size.  The greatest of them is Gabriel. 
Our Prophet actually saw him in his original form.  He had six hundred wings and
blocked the horizon.  Jewels, pearls, and rubies fell from his wings, in a form
only Allah knows about .  Also, the attendants of God’s Throne are among the
greatest angels.  They love the believers and beseech Allah to forgive them
their sins.  They carry the Throne of Allah, about whom the Prophet said:
“I have been given permission to speak about one of
the angels of Allah that carry the Throne.  The distance between his ear-lobes
and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.” (
Abu Daud
)
They do not eat or drink.  When Abraham placed a calf in
front of the visiting angels who brought him the good news of a son, they
refused to eat:
“He said, ‘Will you not eat?’  (When they did not eat), he
conceived a fear of them.  They said: ‘Fear not,’ and they gave him glad
tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.” (Quran 51:26-28)
The angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and
worshipping Allah:
“They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.” (Quran 21:20)
The Number of Angels
How many angels there are?  Only Allah knows.
Al-Bayt
al-Ma’moor
is a sacred house in the heavens above the
Kabah
, the
black cubical sacred house in Mecca.  Every day seventy thousand angels visit
it and leave, never returning to it again, another group coming after them.
[1]
The Messenger of Allah said:
“Hell will be brought forth that day by means of
seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand
angels.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
The Names of Angels
We are required to believe in the names of the angels
that have been mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah.  They include:
Gabriel (
Jibreel
in Arabic), Michael (
Mikaa’eel
),
Israfeel
,
Malik
- the gatekeeper of Hell,
Munkar
and
Nakeer
,
and
Haarut
and
Maarut
and others.
The names Raphael and Azra’eel are not furnished in
Islamic texts.  Of the above, only Gabriel and Michael are mentioned in the
Bible.
Angelic Abilities
The angels have great powers given to them by Allah.
They have the ability to take on different forms other
than their own.  At the moment of Jesus’ conception, Allah sent Gabriel to Mary
in the form of a man, as Allah says in the Quran:
“…Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as
a man in all respects.” (Quran 19:17)
Angels also came to Abraham in human form, and he did
not know that they were angels until they told him so.  Similarly, angels came
to Lot to deliver him from danger in the form of young men with beautiful faces. 
Gabriel used to come to Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, in different forms.  Sometimes he would appear in the form of one
of his handsome disciples, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin.
Angels have the ability to take human forms in some
circumstances involving common people, such as the ones who came to the man who
killed a hundred people and those who came to the blind, the bald and the leper.
The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of
light; the angels are able to travel much faster than thi"

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
Simply stated, there will be a Day when
God will resurrect and gather the first and the last of His creation and judge
everyone justly. People will enter their final abode, Hell or Paradise.
(A) Belief in Events of the Grave
Muslims believe that after a person
dies, the second, intermediate phase of life begins. Many events will take
place in this new “world.”
One of the first events is the “trial”
of the grave - everyone will be questioned by angels about their religion,
prophet, and Lord.
Second, a Muslim should also believe in
the punishment and the bliss of the grave. Basically a Muslim must believe in
the details of the events that will take place in the grave as they have come
in the Qur’an and
Sunnah
.
(B) Events of the Day of Judgment
After the duration of this earth is
over, Allah will command a great angel named
Israfeel
to blow the
Trumpet. At the first blowing, all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth
will fall unconscious, except those spared by God. The earth will be flattened
and the mountains turned into dust.
The skies will rain for forty days,
people will be resurrected into their original bodies from their graves,
thereby entering the third and final phase of life.
Israfeel
will blow the Trumpet for the second time upon which people will rise up from
their graves, alive. The disbelievers and the hypocrites will be caught by
surprise and regret, whereas the believers will find it exactly as they were
told.
The angels will drive all human beings
naked, uncircumcised, and bare-footed to the Great Plain of Gathering called
Hashr
.
The first one to be dressed on that Day will be Abraham. At the Great Plain of
Gathering, a re-created sun will shine close to their heads, and they will
sweat according to their deeds. Some people will be sheltered under the shade
of God’s Magnificent Throne.
When the conditions will become
unbearable, people will request God to allow the Prophets and the Messengers to
intercede on their behalf to save them from distress. All prophets will excuse themselves,
until Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, will
be allowed to intercede and thus Judgment will begin.
The Balances
The balances will be set and the deeds
of men will be weighed. These balances will be real. God will give the deeds of
His creatures a material existence with weight. Good deeds will be placed in
one pan and the evil deeds will be placed in the other, as Allah has informed
in the Qur’an.
The Records
Disclosure of the Records of the deeds
performed in this life will follow. The person who will receive his record in
his right hand will have an easy reckoning. He will happily go back to his
family. However, the person who will receive his record in his left hand would
wish he were dead as he will be thrown into the Fire. He will be full of
regrets as will wish that he were not handed his Record or that he had not
known it.
Then Allah will judge His creation.
They will be reminded and informed of their good and evil deeds. The faithful
will acknowledge their sins and be forgiven. The disbelievers will have no good
deeds to declare because an unbeliever is rewarded for his good deeds in this
life. Some scholars are of the opinion that the punishment of an unbeliever may
be reduced in lieu of his good deeds, except the punishment of the great sin of
disbelief.
The Prophet’s Pond
Every prophet will have a pond, but the
Pond of our Prophet will be the largest, sweetest, and with the largest number
of visitors. Its water will be sweeter than honey and whiter than milk; its
utensils will be as numerous as the stars; and anyone who quenches his thirst
once from it will never thirst again.
The
Siraat
The
Siraat
is a real bridge that
will be established over Hell extending between Paradise and the Fire. Anyone
who is steadfast on God’s religion in this life will find it easy to pass it.
It will be thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword! People will pass over
it as fast as the blinking of an eye, lightening, wind, fast moving horses,
running camels, or at a normal walking pace. Some will barely crawl over it.
They will be grabbed by iron hooks and thrust into the Fire. The one who
crosses the
Siraat
will get into Paradise.
Those who cross itwill be
assembled at a place between Paradise and Hell. They will get their mutual
debts settled and then allowed to enter Paradise.

down by Islam with regards to belief in divine decree (
Qadr
).
·To learn the first two components that the
belief in divine decree entails, i-e Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive and
complete and that Allah has recorded everything in the Preserved Tablet.
Arabic Terms
·
Qadr
– divine decree.
·
Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
- the Preserved
Tablet.
The sixth and last article of Islamic faith is
belief in divine decree (
Qadr
in Arabic).  The divine decree (
Qadr
)
is an extremely important article of faith, and people of various faiths have
differed among themselves concerning this issue for a long time.
The divine decree is Allah’s ‘hidden mystery’
whose depths are inaccessible for human beings to fathom.  A Muslim should
learn the correct belief regarding the divine decree and stick to the advice of
the Prophet:
“When the divine decree (
Qadr
) is
mentioned, take to silence.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
At the same time, we have been given enough
information about this subject in order for us to be at peace with it, even if
we may not know its intricacies. For this reason, it is a compulsory aspect of
faith, and emphasizing the importance of this belief, Ibn Umar, the famous
Companion of Prophet Muhammad, once swore and said of those who rejected it, ‘If
one of them were to spend gold equal to Mount Uhad in the way of Allah, it will
never be accepted by Allah from them, unless they believe in the divine decree
.
’
Ubada bin Samit, a Companion of the Prophet, was
on his death bed when his son visited him and asked,
‘O Father, give me advice so I may hold to it.’
Ubada said,
‘Sit down.  O my son, you shall never taste
faith, and shall not reach the reality of the knowledge of Allah until you have
faith in the divine decree, the good of it and the evil of it.’
So I said,
‘O my father, how do I know what is the good of the
divine decree and the evil of it?’
He said,
‘Know that what afflicted you, could never have missed
you; and what missed you, could never have afflicted you.  O my son, I heard
the Prophet of Allah say that the first thing Allah created was the Pen.  He
said to it, ‘Write’.  So it wrote everything that would take place till the Day
of Judgment.  O my son, if you die while not believing in this, then you will
enter the Fire.’
Ad-Daylami says:
“I went to Ubayy bin Ka’b and told him that I had
some doubts regarding the divine decree, so tell me something so that perchance
Allah makes it leave my heart.  He said, ‘If Allah were to punish the
inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, He would punish them and He would not
be unjust to them; and if He were to show Mercy to them, it would be better for
them than their deeds.  And if you were to spend gold the like of Mount Uhad,
it will not be accepted by Allah until you had faith in the divine decree.  And
know that what afflicted you could never have missed you, and what missed you
could never have afflicted you.’”
So he went to Abdullah Ibn Mas’ud who told him
the same thing.  So he went to Hudthaifah bin al-Yaman
[1]
who told him the same thing.  He went to Zayd bin Thabit who also told him the
same thing.
[2]
What is this faith in the divine decree (
Qadr
)
that these great Companions considered as salvation from the Fire?  What
exactly does one have to believe in?
(1)  Allah’s Foreknowledge is all inclusive
and complete.
(2)  Allah has recorded everything in the
Preserved Tablet.
(3)  Allah’s Will always comes to pass, and
His Ability is perfect.
(4)  Allah created everything.
(1)    Allah’s Foreknowledge is All Inclusive and
Complete
The first necessary component is to believe in Allah’s
infallible foreknowledge.  Allah knows what the creatures will do, encompassing
everything by His knowledge.  He knows all that exists, in entirety and
totality, by virtue of His ancient and eternal foreknowledge.  It is the same
to Him whether it is related to His Actions or the acts of His slaves.  He
knows their state, obedience and disobedience, sustenance, life span, successes
and failures, and all their movements.  Before He created them, and even before
He created the heavens and the earth, Allah knew exactly who will enter Paradise and who will abide in Hell.
“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or
in the heavens.” (Quran 3:5)
“Do you not know that Allah knows all that occurs in
heaven and on earth?” (Quran 22:70)
Whoever refuses it denies Allah’s perfection,
because the opposite of knowledge is either ignorance or forgetfulness.  It
would mean Allah would have been mistaken in His foreknowledge of future
events; He would no longer be Omniscient.  Both are deficiencies which Allah is
free of.  When Pharaoh asked Moses:
“(Pharaoh said:) ‘What about the generations of old?’
(Moses) said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord,
in a Record.  My Lord is neither unaware nor He forgets’” (Quran 20:51, 52)

Unlike
the descriptions of the devil in Christian doctrine,
Shaytan
is not a
fallen angel; rather he is a
Jinn
who can think, reason and has free
will. Allah allowed him to reside amongst the Angels, but because of his pride
and arrogance that you can read about in the story of Prophet Adam on the
website
www.islamreligion.com
, he despairs
of ever knowing Allah’s mercy and has vowed not to inhabit the depths of Hell
alone. Satan’s wish is to take as many human beings with him to the Hellfire as
he can. Make no mistake about it; Satan is humankind’s mortal enemy. He is
cunning, crafty and supremely arrogant. Quran warns us of his enmity over and
over.
“O children of Adam.  Let not
Shaytan
deceive you...”
(Quran 7:27)
“Surely
Shaytan
is an enemy to you so take him as an
enemy...” (Quran 35:6)
“...And whoever takes
Shaytan
as a protector or helper
instead of Allah, has surely suffered a manifest loss.” (Quran 4:119)
It is important to understand that even Satan himself
recognises the Oneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped. Allah has
informed us that the promises of Satan are nothing but deceptions and lies, and
Satan concurs, for he can offer nothing.
“And
Shaytan
will say when the matter has
been decided: ""Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too
promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I
called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves...”
(Quran 14:22)
Every
act of disobedience that is hated by Allah is loved by
Shaytan
, he loves
immorality and sin.  He whispers into the ears of the believers, he
disrupts prayer and the remembrance of Allah. One of Islam’s greatest scholars,
Ibn ul Qayyim, may God have mercy on him, said: “One of his (Satan’s) plots is
that he always bewitches people’s minds until they are deceived, he makes
attractive to the mind that which will harm it”.
Satan
has
wide-ranging
experience in the field of deception; he has tricks and temptations and he
whispers relentlessly. Satan is able to pinch and poke, implanting thoughts and
desires. However Allah has not left humankind defenseless. He has provided us
with weapons and one of the greatest is information.
Satan is our
mortal enemy and in order to combat his tricks and illusions we need to know
him well. The long term goal of Satan is to deprive as many people as possible
of Paradise and to lead them to Hell.  To achieve this aim he has set many
short term goals. Being aware of these goals means we are able to arm ourselves
with weapons of defence.
Short Term Goals
1.To cause people to commit the great sin of
shirk
. Everyone
who worships something other than Allah, be it an idol, a statue, the sun, the
moon, a person or a principle, is in essence worshipping Satan.
[1]
2.To encourage people to commit sins and acts of disobedience. When
Satan despairs of ever being worshipped he is content with being obeyed in
matters that seem insignificant.
[2]
He loves immorality and sin because it has a direct effect on a person’s religious
commitment.
3.To prevent people from doing good deeds. Satan not only causes
people to commit sin and acts of disobedience, he is also content with
preventing them from doing acts of good.  Satan is patient; he lays in wait,
filling our minds with doubts, and superstitions. When a person is planning on
doing a good deed or action, he whispers to them to avoid it and plants small
nagging doubts in their mind.
4.To damage acts of worship. If Satan is not able to prevent
people from obeying Allah and performing righteous actions, he strives to
corrupt their acts of worship. When a person is praying he whispers and
distracts him. Satan’s desire is to prevent a person from taking their reward
for praying with
khushoo
and eventually to lead him or her away from
Allah altogether.
5.
To cause mental and physical harm.In addition to causing
believers to commit acts of
shirk
, Satan also aims to cause physical and
mental harm. For instance he sends bad dreams to cause a person distress and
fear. He disturbs people from the time they are born right up until the moment
of death. In their final moments, he continues his whispering and harassment to
prevent a person from calling on Allah and confirming their belief in God "

Jinn
- A creation of Allah that was created before
humankind from smokeless flame.  They are referred to at times as spirit
beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.

Shirk
– a word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
·
Kufr
– disbelief.
·
Tawheed
– The Oneness and Uniqueness
of Allah with respect to His Lordship, His Names and Attributes and in His
right to be worshipped.
People who practice these
‘arts’ are often called  fortune-tellers, soothsayers, foreseers, augurs,
oracles, astrologers and palmists. They often claim the knowledge of the future
and use various methods and mediums from which they claim to extract their
information, like reading tea-leaves, drawing lines, writing numbers,
palm-reading, casting horoscopes, crystal ball gazing, rattling bones, and
throwing sticks.
Do they truly know what they claim?
1.    Some of them have no real knowledge.  They go
through a series of meaningless rituals and then make calculated general
guesses.  Some of their guesses may coincide with the truth.  People tend to remember
the few predictions that come true and forget about the many which do not.
2.    Another group has contact with the
Jinn
. 
It usually involves the grave sin of
shirk
, and those involved tend to
be more accurate in their information.
Role of
Jinn
The evil
Jinn
can often be summoned by performing
sacrilegious acts forbidden in the religion to aid their human partners in sin
and disbelief.  Once contact with the
Jinn
is made by fortune-tellers,
the
Jinn
may inform them of certain events in the future.  The Prophet,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, described how the
Jinn
gather information about the future.   He related that the
Jinn
were
able to travel to the lower reaches of the heavens and listen in on some of the
information about the future, which the angels pass among themselves.   They
would then return to the earth and feed the information to their human contacts. 
(
Bukhari
).  From this it is clear that the
Jinn
do
not
have knowledge of the unseen, rather they steal words that they hear from the
angels; in fact, the angels themselves do not have any knowledge of that until
Allah tells them of it.
The
Jinn
are also able to inform their human
contact of the future through another channel.  When someone comes to a
fortune-teller, the fortune-teller’s Jinn gets information from the man’s
Qareen
(the
jinn
assigned to every human being) of what plans he had made prior
to his coming.  So the fortune-teller is able to tell him that he will do this
or that, or go here or there.  By this method, the real fortune-teller is also
able to learn about a stranger’s past in vivid detail.  He is able to tell a
total stranger of his parents’ names, where he was born, and his childhood.
Visiting Fortune-tellers
The Prophet laid down principles which clearly forbade
any form of visitation of fortune-tellers.  He said:
“The prayer of whoever approaches a fortune-teller
and asks him about anything will not be accepted for 40 days and nights.” (Muslim)
The punishment is for simply approaching a
fortune-teller and asking him questions out of curiosity.
Belief in Fortune-tellers
Anyone who visits a fortune-teller
believing
that
he knows the unseen and the future has committed
kufr
(disbelief).  The
Prophet said:
“Whosoever approaches a fortune-teller and believes
what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.” (Abu
Dawud)
Such a belief assigns to creation some of Allah’s
attributes with regard to the knowledge of the unseen and the future.
The same applies to anyone who reads the books and

those who believe in them about their future.   However, Allah has stated in no
uncertain terms that He alone knows the future:

Belief in Divine Decree (part 2 of 2),https://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/40/belief-in-divine-decree-part-2,"If everything has been predestined by God, how
does one have any freedom of will?

·An Introduction to Pillars of Islam and
Articles of Faith (2 parts).
Objectives
·To learn the second two components that
belief in divine decree entails, i-e everything happens by the Will of Allah and
His Ability is perfect, and that Allah is the One who created everything.
·To clarify and dispel the confusion
regarding the question of freedom of will.
Arabic Terms
·
Qadr
– divine decree.
(3)    Allah’s Will Passes, and His Ability is Perfect
Whatever Allah wills comes to pass, and whatever
Allah does not will does not happen.  Nothing occurs in the heavens or on the earth
without the Will of Allah.  Hence, whatever is in the universe occurs by the
Will of Allah, be it a divine act or actions of the creation:
“Had He so willed, he would indeed have guided you
all.” (Quran 6:149)
If we were to say that something occurs in
existence without Allah willing it, that would mean that things can occur
without the Will of Allah, and that would be a shortcoming in Allah’s power and
will. Rather, everything that occurs can only be if Allah wills it. If He did
not will it to occur, it could have never come into being.
Likewise the actions of the creation occur by
the Will of Allah:
“And you do not will except that Allah wills – Lord of
the worlds.” (Quran 81:29)
No one can do anything except if Allah wills it
to be, had He willed that they do not take place, they would not have occurred.
(4)    Allah Created Everything
“He has created everything, and has measured it
exactly according to its own measurement.”
“For it is He who creates everything and determines
its nature in accordance with (His own) design.” (Quran 25:2)
This includes our characteristics and our deeds.
The human beings are created by Allah and so are
the actions and statements that result from them.  This is because the actions
and the statements of a person are his characteristics; if the person is a
creation, then so are his characteristics a creation of Allah.
“While Allah has created you and what you do.” (Quran 37:96)
We are given the physical ability and a choice. 
Our abilities like intelligence and memory differ just like our characteristics
like height, weight, and color.  Also, we are given a will and have a choice.
If one of them does not exist, the act would not
be performed.  The One who has created the choice and the ability is Allah, the
Creator of the cause and the effect.  Since Allah has created both, the ability
and the choice in us, hence the acts that we perform are also created by Allah.
Human Freedom of Will
Islamic belief in the divine decree (
Qadr
),
every human act both in material and spiritual life is predestined, keeps human
liberty intact without denying divine interference in human affairs.  It does
not undermine the principle of man’s moral freedom and responsibility.  Man is
not a helpless creature borne along by destiny.  It is incorrect to believe the
action of fate is blind, arbitrary, and relentless.
All is known, but freedom is also granted.
Man is responsible for his acts.  Lethargic
nations and individuals indolent to ordinary affairs of life are to blame
themselves, not Allah.  Man is bound to obey the moral law; and he will receive
merited punishment or reward as he violates or observes that law.  However, if such
is so, man must have it in his power to break or keep the law.  Allah would not
hold us responsible for something unless we were capable of doing it:
“Allah does not burden any human being with more than
he is well able to bear.” (Quran 2:286)
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as
you can.” (Quran 64:16)
Everyone knows the difference between being
compelled to do something and being free; having the choice of doing it, between
a gun put to one’s head and being free in making decisions.
Some people mistakenly imagine the divine decree
of each individual’s future life is so rigorously predetermined in all its
details by Allah that his own volitions or desires have no power to alter the
course of events.  It defeats common sense to reject faith or commit a sin even
before knowing whether or not it was destined! Everyone has the ability to
choose between righteousness and evil, so how can a person willfully choose the
road to perdition and use the divine decree (
Qadr
) as an excuse?  It is
more appropriate to walk on the blessed path and attribute it to one’s destiny. 
Allah knows from eternity with infallible certainty who will be saved and
doomed, while Allah has this infallible foreknowledge, we, on our part, cannot
have an absolutely certain assurance as to how we will end.  The Prophet, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, spoke the truth when he said:
“Seek what is beneficial to you, and ask
Allah for help.  Do not lose hope, and if something were to afflict you, do not
say ‘If I had done so and so’, because saying ‘If’ opens the doors for the
devil.”
“If he is from the successful ones, then
the deeds of the successful ones are made easy for him.” (

featherless arrows to predict situations.  It was prevalent in pre Islamic
Arabia (includes such things as drawing lots, and trying to predict the future).
The means used by Shaytan to misguide people
Making lies and deceptions
appear attractive
.
Shaytan
makes falsehood appear in the guise of
truth and truth appear in the guise of falsehood.  He does this by planting
doubts in people’s mind in exactly the same way as he tempted our Father and
Mother Adam and Eve.  Whispers, doubts and delusions are all part of his bag of
tricks.  Nowadays we see unlawful activities being practiced by many; they are
made to appear attractive and are given names that draw a person towards it.
God has given us a great line of defense; once we equip ourselves with the
knowledge of the laws of Islam, this will unveil the plots of Satan and make it
clear to us his intent.
Tempting people to extremism or
negligence.
If Satan finds a person is serious and cautious, always trying
to do the right thing, he tempts him to strive to excess.  He whispers, do not
sleep when others sleep, do not break your fast when others do and so on.  If
Shaytan sees that a person is lazy or prone to look for the easy way he will
tempt him to be indifferent or negligent.  He encourages procrastination and
laziness.  To protect oneself from this, one should stay close to the Sunnah of
Prophet Muhammad, may Allah praise him.
Making false promises.
Quran
stresses this evil ploy several times with great emphasis.
“
Shaytan
makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and
Shaytan's
promises are nothing but deceptions.”(Quran 4:120)
Satan fills people’s
heads with vain desires and wishes and keeps them busy working on false dreams
and rewards.  This distracts them from the more important things and working
for the Hereafter.  He calls humankind to sin and transgression yet he claims
to be giving sincere advice.
Gradually misleading people.
Satan makes minor sins appear to be nothing until they are piled high upon
one another.  Whenever Satan tricks a person into committing a sin, he leads
him straight on to another sin, and then another and each time the sins become
greater until finally he causes a person to commit the greatest sin of all,
disbelieving in Allah, or ascribing partners to Him.
Causing people to forget what is
in their best interest.  Human beings are forgetful.  It is a trait that is in all
of us and Our creator knows this very well.
“And indeed We made a covenant
with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found on his part no firm will-power.”
(Quran 20:115)
Satan takes this a step further by whispering until a
person forgets exactly what is good for him and what things will lead to sin.  One
example where this could happen is where the religion of Allah is being mocked
in a light-hearted way. Allah cautions us not to take part in such
conversations. He says:
“And when you see those who engage in a false conversation
about Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till
they turn to another topic.  And if Satan causes you to forget, then after the
remembrance sit not you in the company of the wrongdoing people.” (Quran 6:68)
Making people afraid of his
allies.
Another way Satan misguides people is to make them afraid of his (Satan’s)
troops and allies.  He has surrounded himself with evil minions, jinn and human
beings.  He instills the thoughts that they are powerful and fearsome, and if
not obeyed they can harm us.
“It is only
Shaytan
that suggests to you the fear of
his supporters and friends; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true)
believers.” (Quran3:175)
Satan
misguides a
person through what he loves and desires.
Satan finds out what we love or
desire and uses it against us.  He also passes this information on to his
helpers and they attack us with the very things we are attached to.  How often
are our prayers disturbed by thoughts of our children or spouse? Are we guilty
of shopping and delaying our prayer? Satan senses what we like and then sets
about to twist our thoughts.
By instilling doubts.
Shaytan
does not want anyone to turn to Allah in repentance, regretting (past mistakes)
and turning towards what is right and good.  Instead he wants to divert people
away from Allah by using many kinds of temptations and baseless arguments.  He instills
doubts to make a person feel anxious and uncertain.
Through alcohol, gambling,
idolatry, witchcraft and fortunetelling.
Although Allah warns us against
these practices, human beings are weak and Satan takes advantage of this by
making these practices look attractive or worthwhile.  He encourages people to
engage in these pra"

Sunnah
- The word

has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or

The significance of dreams
A dream
is a series of thoughts, images and sensations that occur in the mind whilst a
person is asleep.  Dreams are a universal human experience and the dreamer has
very little control over the content.  Our experiences in dreams have very lifelike
qualities and can be extremely vivid and often bizarre.  Some people report
very emotional experiences during dreams and frightening or upsetting dreams
are often referred to as nightmares.  Throughout the history of humankind
people have tried to interpret their dreams and many people believe they
contain important messages or symbols.  There are many superstitions and
beliefs associated with dreams and Islam has cleared up many misconceptions
involving dreams and their interpretation.
The scholars of Islam say that while dreams can be
meaningful, not all dreams should be considered important.  Ibn Siren is
considered the Islamic world’s foremost expert on dream interpretation and he
calls it a difficult science that should be treated with the utmost care.  The importance
of a dream is usually determined by the impression it makes on the dreamer,
however most dreams have no real value and thus no need for interpretation.
The three types of dreams
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, told us that there are three types of dreams
[1]
. 
A true dream (sometimes called a good dream) that comes to us from Allah, a bad
or frightening dream that comes from the
Shaytan
and the third is a
dream that comes from a person’s experiences and thoughts.  Each one should be
managed differently.
Prophet Muhammad said that if anyone has a dream that he
likes then it is from Allah.  He should therefore thank Allah for it and
narrate it to others
[2]
.   The Prophet went
further and said that if a person has a good dream, he should expect good
things to happen and only narrate the dream to people that he likes
[3]
. 
An example of this in the Quran is when Prophet Yusuf narrated to his father the
dream he had about the sun, the moon and the stars prostrating themselves to
him.  His father, Prophet Yaqub told Yusuf not to relate the dream to his
brothers.
“Remember when Yusuf said to his father: ‘O my father! Verily,
I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and the moon - I saw them
prostrating themselves to me.’ He (the father) said, ‘O my son! Relate not your
vision to your brothers, lest they should arrange a plot against you.’…” (Quran
12: 4 & 5)
Frightening or disturbing dreams are from
Shaytan
and are nothing more than his attempts to scare and terrify us.  Prophet
Muhammad tells us that theses dreams will not harm a person in anyway.  Thus if
a person has a bad dream or nightmare he should spit dryly (no saliva should be
ejected) to his left three times and seek refuge from
Shaytan
with Allah
[4]
. 
He also recommended turning over
[5]
.
The third type of dream is one that does not fit into
either the good or bad category.   These dreams come from what a person has
been thinking or worrying about or from the experiences, events and fears
stored in the memory and the subconscious.   These dreams are of no consequence
and there is no interpretation for them.
Rules of dream interpretation
It is the opinion of most Islamic scholars that dreams
should be interpreted only by someone that is qualified to do so.  The reason
for this is that the interpretation of dreams can be problematic.  Take for
instance a simple thing such as knowing whether the dream you had was about you
or someone else or even someone connected to someone else.  A companion of
Prophet Muhammad’s saw in a dream the great enemy of Islam Abu Jahl becoming
Muslim and pledging allegiance to the Prophet.  This did not happen; it was Abu
Jahl’s son who sometime later converted to Islam and vowed allegiance.  Symbol’s
in dreams are also problematic because they mean different things to different
people.
We must be careful not to rely too much on dreams or
believe that they are filled with hidden meanings and symbols.  However there
are some dreams that are easy to interpret.  If Prophet Muhammad appears in a
dream and looks as he is described in the
Sunnah
then we can be sure that
this is a true dream, one from Allah and full of good tidings.  The Prophet
said that whoever sees him in a dream has indeed seen the truth
[6]
.
In regards to interpreting dreams as an answer to an
Istikarah
prayer
[7]
,
then this is an incorrect practice.  Allah does not answer this prayer through dreams. "

Jinn
- A creation of Allah that was
created before humankind from smokeless flame.  They are referred to at times
as spirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.
·
Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has
several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
The “jinn” are a separate creation of Allah like the
human beings and angels.  They can think like human beings and choose the path
of good or evil, but, unlike human beings, the
jinn
are created from fire
(Quran 15:27, 55:15).  Also, the
jinn
are generally invisible to human
beings (Quran 7: 27) and have some special abilities that human beings simply
do not have.
Believing in
jinn
is not optional.  Since they
are mentioned in the Quran and in the Prophet’s
Sunnah
, a Muslim is
required to believe in their existence and whatever information we find about
them in the two Islamic sources.
Life of the
Jinn
The
jinn
live on earth like human beings do, but
they are found more often in ruins and impure places like toilets and cemeteries. 
They love to sit between the shade and sunlight.
All
jinn
are not equal.  Among them are good
jinn
and among them are evil ones.  Allah mentions in the Quran what the
jinn
said about themselves:
“There are among us some that are righteous, and some the
contrary.  We follow divergent paths.” (Quran 72:11)
There are Muslim and non-Muslim
jinn
.
“And among us are Muslims and among us are disbelievers (who
have deviated from the Right Path).  And whosoever has embraced Islam, then
such have sought the Right Path.” (Quran 72:14)
The
jinn
eat and drink, sometimes with us.  It is
easy to keep them away from eating and drinking with us as we will learn later. 
 They also marry and have children.  Allah has mentioned the children of the
jinn
in the Quran, “...Will you then take him and his progeny as protectors rather
than Me?...” (Quran 18:50)
Jinn
do not live forever, they do die.  The
Prophet used to say in one of his prayers,
“I seek refuge with Your Glory,
there is no true God other than You, the One Who never dies, and the humans and
the
jinn
die.”
(
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
The
jinn
can take the shape of snakes, black
cats, black dogs, and sometime they can assume human form.
The
jinn
also have riding animals as mentioned in
the Quran:
“And incite [to senselessness] whoever you can among them with
your voice and assault them with your horses…” (Quran 17:64)
Abilities of the
Jinn
Compared to human beings, the
jinn
have some
special abilities. One, they can travel very fast.  Allah tells us in the
Quran:
""
lfreet
of the
jinn
said, “I will bring it
to you before you can rise from your place.  Surely, I am strong and trustworthy
for such work.” (Quran 27:39)
They can reach the skies as they are quoted to say in
the Quran:
“And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled
with stern guards and flaming fires.“ (Quran 72:8)
They can take different shapes as mentioned earlier.  The
evil
jinn
– the devils – can possess the human body.  They can also
whisper thoughts and influence human beings:
“From the evil of the whisperer (devil who whispers evil in
the hearts of men) who withdraws (from his whispering in one’s heart after one
remembers Allah).” (Quran 114:4)
Jinn
’s Weaknesses
Even though the evil
jinn
– the devils – have
special abilities, a believer is protected by Allah.  The devils cannot harm a
righteous Muslim by Allah’s permission.
“Surely, My (faithful) slaves - over them you have no power; and
your Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)
The following are some examples of their limited powers:
1.    They fear some believers.
“Surely, My (faithful) slaves – over them you have no power,
and your Lord suffices as (their) guardian.” (Quran 17:65)
“The believer emaciates his devil in the same way
that one of you weakens his camel during travel.” (
Musnad
)
2.    The Prophet said that if we cover our plates
and say ‘
Bismillah
,’ the devils cannot take off the cover.  Similarly,
they cannot enter a house if we close the door saying ‘
Bismillah
.’
“If the man enters his house and mentions the name
of Allah upon entering it and upon eating therein, Satan says, ‘There is no
lodging for you here and no meal here.’ But if the man enters his house and
neglects to mention the name of Allah upon entering it, Satan says, ‘I have
found lodging for you.’ And if he does not mention Allah’s name upon eating his
meal, Satan says, ‘I have found lodging and a meal.’ (
Saheeh Muslim, Musnad
)
3.    They can take different forms, but they can
not take the form of Prophet Muhammad.  The Prophet said,
“Whoever sees me in a dream will have indeed seen
me, for Satan cannot mimic my appearance.” Abu ‘Abdullah said, “Ibn Sirin said,
‘Only if he sees the Prophet in his (real) shape.’” (

Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
We learned in the previous lesson that some
jinn
are good and some are evil. Allah has given them the ability to become
believers or disbelievers. The evil
jinn
are known as devils or
shayateen
in Arabic. The leader of the devils is known as Satan or
Iblees
in
Arabic. He has a very ugly appearance and has two horns.
The Story of
Iblees
Satan used to worship Allah with the angels before he
became arrogant. He chose the evil path in life, knowing it would bring him
punishment. Allah created Adam and ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam.
Satan used to worship Allah with the angels, so he was also addressed to
prostrate himself as well but he refused Allah’s order out of arrogance. As a result,
Satan was cast out of Paradise. He made a promise to Allah that he will mislead
the children of Adam if Allah allowed him to live till the Day of Judgment.
Thus, he became the greatest enemy of man. He saw that Adam was the cause for his
expulsion from Heaven and the reason why Allah cast His curse upon him.
Mission of Satan and the Devils
Satan, or
Iblees
, is the Commander in Chief of
the battle against the earthly human beings. He lays the strategy of this
battle against human beings, dispatches his soldiers, and then reviews their
performance. He praises those who accomplish his mission. The Prophet of Allah
has told us,
“
Iblees
sets his throne on the water. From there,
he sends out his troops to tempt mankind. The one whom he regards as closest to
him is the one who causes the greatest temptation. One of them returns to him
and says, ‘I stayed with so and so and did not leave him until he did such and
such,’ and he is told, ‘You have done nothing.’ Then one comes and reports, ‘I
did not leave him until he separated from his wife.’
Iblees
then brings
him near to him and says, ‘How fine are you!’
[1]
He has soldiers among the
jinn
, known as devils,
and among human beings. Among his soldiers from the
jinn
is the
qareen
,
the devil that accompanies every human being.
The ultimate goal of Satan is to take human beings with
him to Hellfire and keep them from entering Paradise. He does this by getting
people to worship others besides Allah. If he cannot do that, then he leads
them to sin and to disobey Allah. He tries to block people from doing good
deeds. If he cannot do that, then he will do his best to ruin the acts of
worship so the person will not receive any reward for them.
One of the means by which Satan misleads people is
sorcery. Sorcerers can sometimes perform acts to please the devils who in turn
do their bidding. Sorcery is sometimes used to create a separation between
husband and wife (Quran 2:102). Sorcery is of two types, some of it is an
illusion and some is real. Real sorcery can cause separation between spouses
and cause other harms.
Protection Against Satan and the Devils
1.    The greatest means of protecting oneself
against the devil is by sticking to the Quran and
Sunnah
and by living
according to Islam’s teachings. Allah has said in the Quran,
“O you who believe, enter into Islam completely and do not
follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an open enemy to you.” (Quran
2:208)
2.    Seeking protection with Allah.  Actually
turning to Allah and asking Him for protection is one of the best ways to be
safe from Satan.  Allah teaches us in the Quran the words of protection that
can be translated as,
And say, ‘My Lord, I seek refuge with You from the whisperings
of the devils and I seek refuge with You, My Lord, in case they come close to
me.’” (Quran 23:97-98)
3.    Place your children and property under
Allah’s care.  Allah’s Messenger used to seek protection for his grand children
with these words:
“U’eedhu-kuma bi kalimaa-til-laahit-taamah min
kulli shaytaanin wa haama wa min kulli aynin laamah.”
“I commend you two to the protection of the perfect
words of Allah, from every devil and vermin, and from every evil eye.” (
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
)
4.    The best words to seek Allah’s protection.
The last two chapters of the Quran,
Surah
al-Falaq and
Surah
an-Naas, are the best words to seek protection (
Sunan
Nasai
).

Sunnah
- The word
Sunnah
has several meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is
generally accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or
approved.
What drives us?  What makes us do the things we
do?  What makes us happy?
Many people will answer maximizing pleasure and
minimizing pain is the ultimate key to human happiness.
If so, how come people can be happy while in
pain and unhappy while experiencing pleasure?  If pleasure is not the only
motivating force that drives us, what does?  What desires must we fulfill to
live a happy life?
For most of those who see happiness in the carnal,
rather than the spiritual, it is pretty basic: desire to avoid pain and
anxiety, desire to spend time with relatives, desire to eat, desire for sexual
gratification, desire for companionship, and desire for recognition to name a
few.
Life for such can be toilsome, provoking the
plain query; what is it really aiming for?  In their quest for happiness, all
too often people fall short of achieving any kind of inner peace.  We think
that by always reaching higher and accomplishing more - more money, a better
body, the perfect mate - we will automatically be happy.  That is an illusion. 
People get caught up in chasing the materialistic dream under the illusion
money can buy happiness until they discover the limits of materialism.  Impressing
the neighbors and envy of possessions leaves us devoid of passion and depth in
our lives, leading to the Modern Man’s Paradox:  Spiritual hunger in an age of
plenty.
What is the paradox?  Simply put, it is this: As
members of certain materialistic societies have grown richer, they have grown
less content with their lives.  No society in the history of the world has ever
enjoyed the standard of living known today in these societies: Incomes are up,
prices are stable, unemployment is down, life expectancy is rising; they enjoy
more freedom and opportunity than ever before.  Even their poor live well by
world standards.  Yet in America, for example, since 1960, the divorce rate has
doubled, teen suicide has tripled, violent crime has quadrupled, the prison
population has quintupled, and some estimates put the incidence of depression
in the year 2000 at ten times what it was in the year 1900.  Americans are less
happy today than they were 40 years ago, despite the fact that they make 2.5
times as much money.  Our bellies may be filled, but we are left spiritually
hungry.
To find out what really drives human behavior,
two kinds of happiness must be distinguished: feel-good happiness and
value-based happiness.  Feel-good happiness is sensation-based pleasure.  When
we joke around or eat our favorite food, we experience feel-good happiness.  This
type of happiness rarely lasts longer than a few hours at a time.
Value-based happiness is a sense that our lives
have meaning and fulfill the larger purpose of our existence by connecting us
to Allah.  It represents a spiritual source of satisfaction, stemming from our
deeper purpose and values.  Living a God-conscious life rooted in the values of
the Quran and
Sunnah
, a Muslim is driven - beyond sensual pleasures - by
the desire to make it to Paradise and to be safe from Hell after death.
Islamic values that take a person towards Paradise and away from Hell are the most significant factors in motivating a Muslim’s
behavior and in contributing to his or her sense of happiness. The desire to achieve
 Paradise in the afterlife puts the meaning back into life, superseding all
other desires, to bring a sense of direction.  An empty lifestyle focused on
wealth, possessions, drugs, alcohol, and sex is replaced with the hope of
making it to Paradise, a sense of connection with God’s creation, and a life of
devotion to Allah instead of wealth and possessions.  A person is focused on
pleasing Allah even at the cost of our fellow human beings' disapproval.  One
must remember that the jewel of Paradise is veiled by hardships.
To be happy, wake up from materialistic dreams
and realize that nothing save Allah alone is capable of satisfying man!
Ultimate satisfaction will be in reaching our ultimate
goal – Paradise, not in this world, where we are like travelers and strangers. 
Paradise is not God’s residence, or a spiritual state where one becomes a part of
God, as some mistakenly think.  Paradise is a spiritual and sensual residence
of pleasure in which all one’s senses will be gratified to the fullest. It is
an abode of manifold enjoyments for the faithful, its dwellers will not feel
the least pain or sadness. A place where every aspiration will be finally
realized.

·To learn about some of the joys that Paradise
holds.
·To appreciate that the greatest joy will be
seeing Allah in Paradise.
The Joys of Paradise
Those who enter Paradise will do so in their
most perfect, beautiful form.  Their hearts will be one.  They will neither
spit, nor blow their noses, or defecate.  They will remain young forever,
strong and potent without the inconveniences of body hair.
The worldly pleasures pretty much fade in the
face of heavenly delights
.
The pleasures of this world are
fleeting and short-lived, for ‘…short is the enjoyment of this world,’ whereas
the joys of Paradise will be unending, as ‘…the provision is eternal.’
The fine clothes, delicious foods, soothing
drinks, ornate jewels, and grand palaces in Paradise are far superior to what
is in this world.  The ‘real estate’ of Paradise is described by the Prophet to
be better than the whole world!
Paradise is free of any pollutants, foul odors,
pain, or discomfort.  The hearts and speech will be pure.  No one will be
offended or insulted.
The delicious, ripe fruits of Paradise will be
within easy reach, ready for its residents to pick whatever fruit one desires. 
Any food or drink will be available on demand.  Paradise has seas of water,
wine, milk, and honey from which rivers will flow out.  You simply take your
pick!  It has fountains scented with camphor and ginger, and shady valleys.  The
wine will not cause hangovers.  It is “delight for those who drink”, bringing
neither drunkenness
[1]
nor rousing
folly or quarrelling.
The inhabitants of Paradise will be served in
gold and silver goblets and dishes.  Their finest silk clothes will be
decorated with gold, silver, and pearls…better than any man-made garment!  The
scent of Musk will emanate from their bodies..  Their palaces will distinguished
by refined elegance and be fully furnished.  They will be able to sit and
recline in their gardens.  The beautiful bright colored couches will be lined
with silk brocade.  Eye catching cushions and splendid carpets will add style
and luxury.  A cozy place most people can simply dream of in this world, and  tranquil
spot away from distractions;  peaceful, comfortable, and richly decorated.
The faithful, who ‘will be served by immortal youths,
with cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine;’ exquisite banquets
served in priceless vessels.
The faithful will visit one another and reunite
with family and friends who made it to Paradise.  All wishes will be fulfilled,
some in the strangest ways.  The Messenger of Allah said:
“If the believer in Paradise wishes for a
child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in
an instant.” (
Al-Tirmidhi
)
Naturally, running after worldly pleasures at
the cost of heavenly delights will be a cause of much sorrow for people who
will enter Hell.
Spouses & Intimacy in Paradise
Just as some people can’t perceive colors, so we
may be soul-blind and soul-deaf.  The soul’s yearnings simply don’t get through
to consciousness; or if they do, we try to numb ourselves to them with
medications or frenzied activities.  The resulting alienation within our very
hearts bears its own loneliness.  The soul wants to be attached and involved,
because it is through such intimacy that it is nourished, initiated, and
deepened.  The faithful will enjoy earthly and heavenly spouses in Paradise
to satisfy the soul’s cravings for companionship and intimacy.  All the
urgencies of the soul – the feeling of longing, the ache of desire for a
beautiful, compatible partner, and the urgency to visit old friends – will be
met.  The select will rejoice in the company of the parents, spouses and
children who were believers.
The faithful will be clothed in the richest
silks and brocades, and adorned with bracelets of gold and silver, and crowns
set with pearls, and will make use of silken carpets, couches, and pillows. In order
to enjoy all these pleasures, Allah will grant them perpetual youth, beauty,
and vigor.  There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise
“aged thirty-three years.”  It is the most perfect age at which one is most
able to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one’s health and
strength are most perfect.  It is proven from the Prophet they “will never lose
their youth.”
The faithful will enter Paradise in the best and
most perfect condition in all senses.  They will remain young forever, their
eternal delight will be unending, and they will live a life of unspoiled joy.
The faithful will enjoy specially crafted
maidens, or
houris
, of Paradise, created not of clay, as in the case of
mortal women, but of pure musk, and free from all natural impurities, defects,
and inconveniences.  They will be beautiful, modest, and secluded from public
view in pavilions of hollow pearls. Thus the body will have its share of
gratification.
Vision of Allah
In heaven the faithful will see Allah, clearly
and distinctly.  Here on earth we “see” Him but indirectly through "

Belief in the Day of Judgment
(also known as the Day of Resurrection and the Last Day and in Arabic
Yom al-Qiyyamah
)
is one of the six pillars of the Islamic faith.  This means that it is a
concept that a Muslim is required to believe and understand.  Basically Muslims
believe that there will come a day when the universe as we know it will be
destroyed and the dead will be resurrected to face Allah, the Almighty to be
judged according to their deeds in this life.  The ultimate goal is to be
accepted into a never ending paradise.
And those who believe and do righteous deeds, they are
dwellers of Paradise, they dwell therein forever.   (Quran 2:82)
Many people wait and look forward to this momentous Day with
a mixture of fear and anticipation.  Others believe it is something  far off that
does not concern them and still others look for the signs of the coming of this
Day.
Surah
21 of the Quran acknowledges the thoughtlessness of many
when it begins,
“Draws near for humankind their reckoning, while they turn
away in heedlessness.” (Quran 21:1)
Countless books and articles have been written and
videos made of the signs of the Day of Judgment without knowing exactly what to
believe and what not to believe.  The aim of this and the following lesson is
to set out the signs of the Day of Judgment in an informal and easily
understood way.  Two important points to bear in mind whenever reading or
researching about the Day of Judgment are as follows.  Firstly, the knowledge
of the signs, trials and tribulations associated with the Day of Judgement must
be derived from the Quran and the authentic
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad. 
And secondly, nobody knows when the hour
[1]
will occur.
“Verily Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour…”
(Quran 31:34)
Humankind is only able to look for the signs.
The Prophet said, “The Hour will come when leaders are
oppressors, when people believe in the stars and reject
al-Qadr
(divine decree)
[2]
, when a trust
becomes a way of making a profit, when people give
Sadaqah
reluctantly, when adultery becomes widespread - when this happens, then your
people will perish.“
Minor signs
Minor signs of the Day of Judgment are those signs that
may occur a long time before the actual Day.  They happen in the course of
daily world events, they are numerous and often go pass unnoticed, even
occurring repeatedly.   Some commentators have estimated that there are more
than 100 minor signs of the Day of Judgment.  Contemplating the minor signs of
the Day of Judgement should serve to remind believers that Allah has
foreknowledge of everything that is occurring or will occur in the future.  Allah’s
knowledge is vast and superior and He is aware of all that we do, see or think. 
We will list some of the more well-known minor signs and ask you to consider
whether or not these signs are happening around you or have happened in the
past.
·Time will pass rapidly, good deeds will
decrease, miserliness will be thrown (in the hearts of the people), afflictions
will appear and there will be much ‘Al-Harj.” They said, “O Allah’s Apostle!
What is “Al-Harj?” He said, “Killing! Killing!”
·The common appearance of lewd acts, working
to bring about lewd acts, the cutting off of the ties of relationship and the
trusting of deceivers.
·The disappearance of knowledge and the
appearance of ignorance.
·Wealth will be in abundance; so abundant
that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his
Zakah
,
and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be
offered) will say, ‘I am not in need of it.’
·The people compete with one another in
constructing high buildings.
·A man when passing by a grave of someone
will say, ‘Would that I was in his place’.
·Two parties of Muslims will confront each
other and there is a large-scale massacre amongst them and the claim of both of
them is the same.
·People will establish ties with strangers
and sever relations with their near and dear ones.
·Earthquakes will increase.
·Any gain is shared out only among the rich,
with no benefit to the poor.
·A trust becomes a means of making a profit.
·Paying
Zakah
becomes a burden.
·Men obey their wives and disobey their
mothers; and treat their friends kindly whilst shunning their father"

Iqamah
– This word refers to the
second call to prayer that is given immediately before the prayer begins.
The major signs of the Day of
Judgment are those events that will occur shortly before the Day begins.  They
are extraordinary and supernatural events and do not occur repeatedly.  These
events are the precursor to the actual blowing of the trumpet when life as we
know it will cease to exist.
The appearance of the Mahdi
A man from the descendants of the Prophet Mohammad will
appear and the religion of Allah will prevail.  The Mahdi will take control of
the land (or the earth) and it will be filled with justice, wrongdoing and
oppression will no longer exist.  It is said in an authentic
hadith
that
the Mahdi’s name will be like the name of Prophet Muhammad and his father’s
name will be like the Prophet’s father’s name.  He will be a descendant of
Fatimah, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad and he will appear in the East.
The Dajjaal (The Antichrist)
This is a man from the sons of Adam.  His features are
mentioned in authentic
ahadith
; he will have a ruddy complexion and
curly hair, and will be one-eyed, with his right eye looking like a floating
grape.  Between his eyes will be written the letters “kaaf-fa-ra“ (in unjoined
letters) or “
kaafir
” (disbeliever), which every Muslim, literate or
illiterate, will be able to read.  He will also be the last of his line,
sterile with no children.
The
fitnah
(trial, tribulation) of the Dajjaal
will be the greatest
fitnah
ever because of the power Allah will permit
him to have.   He will work great miracles both amazing and confusing.  He will
have a paradise and a hell, but his paradise will in fact be a hell, and vice
versa.  He will have rivers of water and mountains of bread.  He will command
the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth
its produce, and it will bring forth its produce.
The destruction of the Dajjaal will come at the hands of
Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus), “The Dajjaal will emerge among my nation… and Allah
will send Isa ibn Maryam… and he will pursue him and destroy him.”
[1]
The descent of Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, son of Mary)
After the Dajjaal has appeared and caused
fitnah
throughout
the land, Allah will send Isa ibn Maryam, who will descend to the earth at a
white minaret in the East of Damascus, Syria, resting his hands on the wings of
two angels.  He will descend at the time when the
iqamah
for prayer is
being given, and he will pray behind the leader of that group.  Quran commentator
Ibn Kathir sums up several
ahadith
about the descent of Isa ibn Maryam
when he says “Isa ibn Maryam will descend before the Day of Judgement as a just
leader and fair ruler”.
Yajooj and Majooj (Gog and Magog)
Yajooj and Majooj are human beings, descended from Adam
and Hawa (Eve).  According to the descriptions in the
sunnah
they appear
to belong to the Turkic-Mongol race, with small eyes, small, flat noses and
wide faces.  Their appearance at the end of time is one of the signs of the
Hour, “Until, when Yajooj and Majooj are let loose (from their barrier), and
they swiftly swarm from every mound.  And the true promise (Day of Resurrection)
shall draw near (to fulfilment)…”
(Quran 21: 96 & 97)
The swallowing up of the earth
This means that a place is swallowed up in the earth and
disappears into it, as is described in the Quran, “So We caused the earth to
swallow him and his dwelling place…”
(Quran 28:81)
Three of these
events will occur.
It is said that three huge landslides or earthquakes
(tsunami) will happen, one in the East, one in the West and one in the Arabian
Peninsula.
The smoke
Another of the major signs of the Hour will be the
appearance of “the smoke”.  “Then watch for the Day when the sky will bring a
visible smoke. Covering the people; this is a painful torment.”
(Quran 44:10
& 11)
The smoke will affect both the believers and the disbelievers. 
The believers will be affected as if suffering from a cold while the disbelievers
will be rendered unconscious.
The rising of the sun from the West
“The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from
the West, and when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, but
that will be w"

Meaning
In the simplest of words, “intercession” means to act as
a mediator on behalf of someone to get them some benefit or ward off harm from
them.
Intercession on the Day of Resurrection is of two types:
1.Accepted Intercession: This is intercession which is proven in
the texts of
Shariah
. More details will be given below.
2.Rejected Intercession: This is intercession which according to
the texts of the Quran and
Sunnah
is invalid and ineffective as will be explained
in Part 2.
There are two types of Accepted Intercession that will
take place in the Hereafter:
A. Intercession Exclusive to the Prophet
The first type is an exclusive intercession that which
will be granted only to Prophet Muhammad and no one else will share it with
him. It is of various kinds:
1.The Greatest Intercession also known as
maqam-mahmood
or
the ‘station of praise and glory.’ The earlier and later generations will ask
the Prophet to intercede for them with their Lord so that He might relieve them
of the horrors of the Day of Judgement. This is the ‘station of praise and
glory’ which Allah has promised to him in the Quran:
“And in some parts of the night (also) offer the prayer with
it (i.e. recite the Quran in the prayer) as an additional prayer for you (O
Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to
maqam-mahmood
.” (Quran
17:79)
The Prophet Muhammad will intercede for all of mankind
so that the reckoning can begin. In a narration it states that mankind will be
distressed and anxious and will reach a point where they can no longer bear the
lengthy wait and will say, “Who will intercede for us with our Lord so that He
will pass judgement among His slaves?”  So people will come to the prophets,
each of whom will say, “I am not suitable for this position,” until they come
to our Prophet, who will say, “I am able to do it.” So he will intercede for
them that judgement may be passed.
This intercession belongs exclusively to the Prophet
Muhammad.
There are many other reports that speak of this
intercession: “The people will fall on their knees on the Day of Resurrection,
each nation following its prophet, saying, ‘O So and so, intercede!’ until
intercession is granted to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him). On that Day Allah will resurrect him to a station of praise and
glory.”
[1]
2.Intercession of the Prophet Muhammad that the believers be
granted permission to enter Paradise.
The Messenger of Allah said: “I will come to the gate of
Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The
gatekeeper will say, ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say, ‘I was
commanded not to open it for anyone before you.’”
[2]
According to another report narrated by Muslim, “I will
be the first one to intercede concerning Paradise.”
3.Intercession of Prophet Muhammad for his paternal uncle Abu
Talib, so that the torment of the Fire be reduced for him. This applies only in
the case of the Prophet and his paternal uncle Abu Talib.
Once, Abu Talib was mentioned in the presence of the
Messenger of Allah. He said, “Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the
Day of Resurrection, and he will be placed in a shallow part of the Fire which
will come up to his ankles and cause his brain to boil.”
[3]
4.Intercession that some people of his
Ummah
may enter
Paradise without being brought to account.
This kind of intercession was mentioned by some of the
scholars, who quoted as evidence the lengthy hadith which states:
“Then it will be said, ‘O Muhammad, raise you head; ask,
it will be given to you; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ So I
will raise my head and say, ‘My
Ummah
, O Lord; my
Ummah
, O Lord;
my
Ummah
, O Lord.’ It will be said, ‘Admit those among your
Ummah
who are  not to be brought to account through the right-hand gate of Paradise.
They will share the other gates with the people of other nations.’”

Conditions of Intercession
One of the most important matters to understand is that
Allah and Allah alone ‘owns’ intercession.  No human being ‘owns’ intercession.
Intercession in the Hereafter will only happen if the
following conditions are met:
1. Allah must approve of the person for
whom
intercession is made.
“…and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is
pleased” (Quran 21:28)
One for whom intercession is made must be a believer in
Tawheed
because Allah is not pleased with the
mushrikoon
(polytheists).
.
It was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who will be the most
blessed of people by your intercession of the Day of Resurrection?’ The
Messenger of Allah said:
“O Abu Hurayrah, I thought that no one would ask me
about this
hadith
before you because I have seen how keen you are to
learn
hadith
.  The people who will be most blessed by my intercession on
the Day of Resurrection are those who say
La ilaha illa Allah
sincerely
from the heart.’”
2.  Allah must give permission to intercede.
“Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His
Permission?” (Quran 2:255)
3.  Allah must approve of the
intercessor
.
“…whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has
given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with” (Quran 53:26)
Rejected Intercession
The Rejected Intercession is one that
does not meet
the conditions
required for permission from Allah or His being pleased
(with the intercessor or the one for whom intercession is made), such as the
intercession which the people of
shirk
believe that their gods will be
able to do for them.  Many of them only worship their gods because they believe
that they will intercede for them with Allah, and that they are middle men
between them and Allah.  Allah says:
“Surely, the religion is for Allah only.  And those who take
protectors besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near
to Allah.’ Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they
differ.  Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever” (Quran
39:9)
Allah tells us that this kind of intercession is
ineffective and of no benefit:
“So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to
them” (Quran 74:48)
“And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not benefit
another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be
taken from him nor will they be helped.” (Quran 2:48)
“O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided
for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship,
nor intercession.  And it is the disbelievers who are the wrongdoers.” (Quran
2:254)
Hence, Allah did not accept the intercession of His
Khaleel
[1]
Ibrahim for his father Azar who was a pagan.  The Prophet said:
“Ibrahim will meet his father on the Day of
Resurrection, and Azar’s face will be dark and covered with dust.  Ibrahim will
say to him, ‘Did I not tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will say, ‘Today
I will not disobey you.'’ Ibrahim will say, ‘O Lord! You promised me not to
disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me
than cursing and dishonoring my father?’ Then Allah will say, ‘I have forbidden
Paradise to the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrahim, what is
beneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a
dhabh
(an
animal,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown into the
Fire.”
[2]
Wisdom of Intercession
The point of intercession is to honor the person
interceding.  It is Allah’s way of making the person stand out in front of His
creation.  That is the reason why Prophet Muhammad and the prophets will be
allowed to intercede as detailed above.
Furthermore, intercession should not make a person
complacent about sins.  A person must never think that he can rely on
intercession and sin all he wants!  For, he is not guaranteed that Allah will
allow someone to intercede for him.  Furthermore, his sins might lead him into
outright disbelief in which case no one’s intercession will benefit him.  Lastly,
he might receive punishment before he is interceded for and released.

Rakah
- unit of prayer.
Before we can examine the
events that Allah says will happen on the Day of Judgement we must ask
ourselves just when that Day will be.  And we are not the first generation to
ask that question.  Prophet Muhammad was asked many times by many people about
when this Day would arrive.  The answer now, even though we have made
remarkable advances in all forms of knowledge, particularly technology and
science, is still the same.  Allah alone knows when the hour that starts the
Day of Judgement will be.  When the angel Gabriel came to the Prophet in the
guise of a well-dressed man, one of the questions he asked was about the Hour. 
Prophet Muhammad answered that, “The one questioned about it knows no better
than the questioner.”
“Men ask you of the Hour, Say the knowledge of it is with
Allah only, what can convey to you that may be the Hour is near.” (Quran 33:63)
“Verily, the Hour is coming and My Will is to keep it hidden...”
(Quran 20:15)
Allah is concealing the date of the Day of Judgement
from us.  This verse alone should indicate to us that this is nothing less than
a momentous occasion of gargantuan proportions.  Although we do not know when
the Day of Judgement will be, Allah and His Messenger Muhammad (may the mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon him) have described in detail what will happen
on that Day.  In this and the following two lessons we will describe the events
of the Day of Judgement as they are described to us in the Quran and the
authentic
a
hadith
.
Blowing the Trumpet.
The Day of Judgment will come upon humankind suddenly.   No
matter how well informed or interested someone is in the signs that will precede
it, its commencement will come as a shock.  The trumpet will be blown and the
people will hear a sound so horrendous that the mountains and the earth itself
will crumble to dust.
“And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast, and the
earth and the mountains are removed from their places, and crushed with a single
crushing, then on that Day shall the (Great) Event befall.” (Quran 69:13-15)
Allah says that it will be a single shout, a long
continuous sound that will not cease until everything has perished
(Quran
38:15)
.  It will then be followed by a second blowing of the trumpet.  Behold,
Allah tells us that everyone who has ever lived will find themselves standing,
staring, and shocked by the events.
“And the trumpet will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens
and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom Allah wills.  Then it
will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on!” (Quran
39:68)
The Standing
The trumpet is blown, the earth is rolled up like a
scroll and the dead rise.  Bones and body parts join together, brains begin to
work.  Truly humankind has been returned to Allah.  All of humankind were dead,
those who died before the blowing of the trumpet and those who died in the
cataclysmic event that levelled the earth to a plane.  The Day of Judgement has
begun.  People stand in groups, staring ahead.
“Every soul will taste death.  Then to Us will you be returned”
(Quran 29:57)
“ Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes.  [We
are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips!” (Quran 75:3-4)
Once the initial shock of being returned to life begins
to wear off, the reality of the situation begins to set in.  The veil of the
physical world has been removed.  The deeds we did are set out for us to see.
“So
whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it.  And whoever does an atom’s
weight of evil will see it.”
(Quran 99:7, 8)
Another promise of
Allah’s fulfilled.  Some people are happy with their situation others begin to
tremble in fear.
A person’s deeds will determine their length of the
standing but all people waiting will be  barefoot, naked, and uncircumcised.
Ahadith
tell us that this standing in fear and trepidation could be as long as 50,000
years
[1]
but for a
pious person it might be as little as the time it takes to pray two
rakahs
of prayer.  The people waiting will be frightened, their hearts beating like
drums in their chests and ears.  They will run about as if in a drunken state
and care nothing about anyone but themselves.  Parents, spouses and children
will be long forgotten.  Gripped by fear they will begin to question their
situation.
“He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind,
while I had sight (before)?’ [Allah] will say, ‘This is how it is: Our signs came
unto you, but you disregarded them, and thus will you this Day be forgotten.’”
(Quran 20:125)
Prophet Muhammad informs us that on the Day of Judgement
the sun will be bought near to humankind.  The sun would only be a mile away
and the peopl"

Waiting for what is to come.
On the Day of Judgement, after the
trumpet has been blown and the bodies of all humanity have been resurrected the
people stand on a wide open plane waiting for the judgment to begin.  They will
be distressed and their hearts remain filled with fear and remorse.  They will
be confused and in utter disbelief.   Allah tells us that this will be a time,
“When
sight is confounded, and the moon is eclipsed (hidden from view), and the sun
and the moon are brought together.” (Quran 75:7-9)
.  The people are
gathered under an eerie light and will be made to wait.  This is a day when the
heavens will be rent asunder and the
“…and the angels will be sent down, a
grand descent.”
(Quran 25:25)
The angels are sent down in rows, a
grand descent as Quran describes it.  Both the people and the angels stand in
rows waiting for the judgement and time is not behaving as the people expect.  The
standing seems interminable, will it ever end?
“And the angels will be on its sides, and
eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.  On that
Day you will be brought to judgement and none of your secrets will remain
hidden.” (Quran 69: 17-18)
On this Day even those whose light shines
through their faces will fear to stand before Allah and those who are shaded by
the grace of Allah remain fearful of the momentous occasion.  The people’s
distress on this Day of Reckoning will become so intense that they will run to
various prophets begging for their intercession and ask Allah to begin the
judgment.
The Prophets
[1]
The people will be gathered together in
groups or individually, caring nothing for those around them.  “Who will help
us!” they cry and turn to the prophets.  They will rush to Adam, the father of
humanity and beg for his intercession on their behalf but Adam is also afraid. 
They will say, “Please Adam you are the one to whom the angels prostrated”, but
Adam, peace be upon him, will reply “Myself myself” and he tells the people that
his Lord is angry like never before, go to Prophet Ibrahim.
The people will go to Ibrahim and beg, “You
are the one who is beloved by Allah, please ask Him to start judgment”.  Ibrahim
will reply just as Adam did, “Myself, myself.  Today my Lord is angry like
never before, go to Musa”.  Then they will go to Prophet Musa, begging for the
judgment to start.  In mental and physical pain, sweat dripping down their
bodies, hearts thumping, the people will continue in the same vein and Musa
will send them to Prophet Isa.  Each Prophet is fearful of Allah and concerned
about his own punishment.
The people will then surge to Prophet Isa
begging for his help.  “You were created by Allah’s command; you talked to people
from the cradle, intercede for us before your Lord!” Prophet Isa will respond
in exactly the same way as the others.  Even though he is the slave of Allah,
and even though he ascended to Allah after his time on earth, Prophet Isa too
will be concerned for his own judgment.   “Myself, myself.  Today my Lord is
angry like never before so go to Muhammad, the final prophet”.
The people will rush to Prophet
Muhammad, and say to him, “you are the last of the prophets and our final hope,
please ask Allah to start judgment!”  He replies, “I’ll go, I’ll go”.
What happens next can be found in an authentic
hadith
.   Prophet Muhammad goes to his Lord, Allah.  “Then I will ask my
Lord for permission and He will give me permission, and He will inspire me with
words of praise with which I will praise Him, words that I do not know now.  So
I will praise Him with those words of praise and I will fall down prostrate
before Him.  He will say, ‘O Muhammad! Raise your head; ask, for it will be
given to you, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.’ I will
raise my head and say, ‘My
Ummah
, O Lord! My
Ummah
, O Lord!’ …”
[2]
This is what is known as the greatest
intercession, it is
al-maqaam al-mahmood
, Prophet Muhammad
intercedes for the people that Allah might relieve them of the horrors and
begin the judgement.
“...  so that your Lord may raise you to
Maqaam
Mahmood
(a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on
the Day of Resurrection)” (Quran 17:79)
Hell and Paradise are bought close.
Before Judgement commences however,
Hell must be bought forth.  The angels and all of humanity are standing,
waiting, becoming increasingly distressed, worried only about themselves,
pleading for help and Hell is brought close.  The people are already distressed
to the point of hysteria but those who a"

Your new everlasting life is about to begin.  This is
the Day of Judgment.  All of humanity will be judged by Allah according to
their beliefs and deeds. This is the culmination of the message of all the
prophets.  Worship One God and know that you will one day be accountable for
all that you say and do. This day has arrived. It is a shock, all of humanity are
standing together in awe. What happens now?
“Verily, We have warned you of a near torment, the Day when
man will see that (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth, and the
disbeliever will say: ‘Woe to me! Would that I were dust!’"" (Quran 78:40)
The Scales of Justice
The scales of justice sometimes referred to as the
balances or the scale of deeds will be set up and each deed will be weighed and
tallied.
No deed even an atom’s weight will be overlooked whether
it be the backbiting that was forgotten or the kind word that was said without
thinking.
“Whoever brings a good deed shall be rewarded ten times the
like of it, and he that does evil shall only be rewarded the like of it, and
they shall not be wronged.” (Quran 6:160).
Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, also reminded us of the mercy of Allah. He said, ‘There is nothing
that will be placed in the Balance that will weigh more heavily than a good conduct.
The one who has a good conduct will attain thereby the status of one who fasts
and prays (a great deal).’
[1]
The Book of Deeds
""‘…Woe to us! what sort of book is this that leaves
neither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded it with numbers!’ and
they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no
one with injustice. (Quran 18:49)
Each person will be given a book in either their right
or left hand. Everything we do in this world has been recorded by angels. The
good and the bad, things we have forgotten or never given a thought to, it is
all recorded and Allah might choose to question us about each and every word.
Those who are given the book in their right hand will begin to relax and feel
happy and honoured.
“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right
hand, He surely, will receive an easy reckoning, And will return to his family
in joy!” But whosoever is given his Record behind his back He will invoke (for
his) destruction, And he shall enter a blazing Fire”(Quran 84:7-12)
Sadly though, many will receive their book in their
left hand or behind their back. And the fear rises.
The Accounting
The first thing that each person will be questioned
about is his prayer.Prayer is what is known as one of the rights we owe
to Allah. Each person will be asked about the quality of their prayers. This is
confirmed and reinforced by the words of Prophet Muhammad.
It is recorded in an authentic
hadith
that
Prophet Muhammad said, “The first thing the people will be held accountable for
on the Day of Judgment is prayer, Allah will say to His angels (even though He
already knows), ‘Look at my slave’s prayers. Were they complete or not?’ If
they were complete it will be written as complete. If they were not fully
complete Allah will say: ‘See if my slave has voluntary prayers’, if he has
them Allah will say, ‘Complete the shortage in his obligatory prayers with his
voluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same
manner.”
[2]
The words of Prophet Muhammad help us to paint a very
clear picture in our minds of what will happen to us when we stand before Allah
on the Day of Accounting. He also said, “The son of Adam will be questioned by
Allah about five things: how he lived his life, and how he utilized his youth, by
what means did he earn his wealth, how did he spend his wealth, and what did he
do with his knowledge.”
[3]
We should be grateful that we are able to prepare
ourselves adequately before the great Day occurs, as we even know the type of
questions that we will be asked and the types of behavior that we will be
questioned about.  The good believer prepares for this difficult event, so that
he or she will not be among those whose body parts testify against them.
""On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their
feet will bear witness against them as to their actions.” (Quran 24:24)
“And they will say to their skin, ‘Why did you bear witness
against us?’ They"

The grave is the abode of the
body after death and death is something we will all experience.  There is no
denying this or hiding from it.  Death will come to each and every one of us.  Some
will die earlier in their lifespan than others, according to the will of Allah
but everyone who lives will die at his appointed time, whether he is amongst
the pious or wicked.  Therefore it is important that each and every one of us
understands what will happen after we die.  We die and we are buried but that
is not the end, on the contrary it is just the beginning.
“Every soul shall taste death...” (Quran 3:185)
The prophets of Allah called their people to worship One
God, Allah the Almighty, and they also taught the people to believe in life
after death.  It was thought of as an extremely important concept, so much so
that failure to believe in it rendered all beliefs meaningless.  In accordance
with this, one of the 'pillars of faith' is belief in life after death.  This
life is often referred to as the Hereafter, and the first stage of the Hereafter
is life in the grave.
In an authentic
hadith
Prophet Muhammad said, “The
grave is the first stage of the Hereafter …”
[1]
With this in mind it is important to remember that this worldly life is a
series of trials and tests that determine our place in the Hereafter.  All
actions are recorded and they form the basis of any punishment or reward a
person is destined to receive.
“This is because of that (evil) which your hands have sent
before you.  And certainly, Allah is never unjust to (His) slaves.” (Quran 3:182)
“This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit
because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world).” (Quran 43:72)
Life in the grave is often referred to as life in the
Barzakh
.
Barzakh
literally means an obstacle, hindrance or
something that separates one thing from another such as this following
description in the Quran:
“He has let loosed the two seas (the salt water and the sweet)
meeting together. Between them is a barrier (
Barzakh
), which none of
them can transgress.” (Quran 55:19-20)
As such it is a barrier that cannot be crossed except by
the permission of Allah.  In the context of life and death,
Barzakh
is the
period between a person's death and his resurrection on Judgment Day.  The very
nature of life in the
Barzakh
is a matter of the
ghayb
and thus its
details are known to Allah alone.  However Allah did reveal some matters of the
ghayb
to Prophet Muhammad and he in turn conveyed those things to us.
After any burial Prophet Muhammad would remind his
companions to ask forgiveness for their brother or sister, and to ask Allah
that they remain steadfast at the time of questioning.
[2]
This was
because Prophet Muhammad said that what comes after the burial could be very
difficult indeed.   After informing his
sahabi
that the grave is the
first stage of the Hereafter, Prophet Muhammad said, “…if one finds salvation
(at this stage) the succeeding (stages) become easy for him, and if he does not
find salvation in it, what follows this stage is very hard upon him.” Prophet
Muhammad’s beloved wife Aisha recalls that the Prophet used to regularly seek
refuge with Allah from the torment and tribulations of the grave.
[3]
And it is
understood by the scholars of Islam that the tribulations refer to the
questioning.
Thus it would be pertinent for us to follow his example
and seek refuge with Allah from being punished in the grave.  Prophet Muhammad himself,
in a relatively long but very descriptive and informative
hadith
explains
very clearly what will happen before the questioning.  It was a subject that
the
sahabah
were very interested in and they describe themselves as
sitting like birds, meaning they were quiet and still, when listening to
Prophet Muhammad talk about the life in the grave.

perfumes from Jannah.  Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and
he says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure.’
Then it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a water-skin.  When
he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant bef"

The scene for the disbelievers
is very different.  The angels come to a disbeliever “…with dark faces,
bringing sackcloth, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see.  Then
the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O evil soul, come
forth to the wrath of Allah and His anger.’  Then his soul disperses inside his
body, and then comes out cutting the veins and nerves, like a skewer passing
through wet wool.  When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an
instant before they take it and put it in that sackcloth, and there comes from
it a stench like the foulest stench of a dead body on the face of the earth.  Then
they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is
this evil soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so’, calling
him by the worst names by which he was known in this world, until they reach
the lowest heaven.  They ask for it to be opened to them and it is not opened.”
 Then Allah records his place as being in the lowest depths of hell.
Once the soul has been reunited with the body, the dead
person is visited in their grave by two angels.   In an authentic
hadith
Prophet Muhammad tells us that these angels are black and blue and named Munkar
and Nakeer.  The angels will ask three questions that will affirm a person’s
faith and at the same time lay bare their piousness or wickedness.  This is a
very important stage because it sets the scene for the whole of a person’s life
in the Hereafter.  The angels ask who is your Lord, what is your religion and
who is your Prophet? Or as in some
ahadith
it is said that the question
will be who is this man who was sent amongst you?  As you can see these
questions concern matters of faith
.
If a person answers, my Lord is
Allah, my religion is Islam, my prophet is Muhammad … a voice calls out from
heaven, “My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and
clothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.” If the deceased
does not know the correct answer to the questions, then a voice calls out from
heaven, “Prepare for him a bed from Hell and clothe him from Hell, and open for
him a gate to Hell.  ”
The questioning confirms exactly what a person has
understood since the moment of death.  Good really will be rewarded and evil
will be punished.  And thus the believer is immediately rewarded with an
opening that appears in his grave.  Through the opening the person can see the
grandeur and bounties waiting for him in Paradise.  His good deeds will come to
him in the form of a well-dressed, handsome , finely perfumed man.  The grave
will be widened as far as the eye can see, it will be well-lit and filled with
greenery; he will long to tell his family of his good fortune.  The believer
will sleep peacefully in his grave.  Prophet Muhammad mentioned in a
hadith
that the believer will be told to look at his place in the Hellfire and
understand that it has been exchanged for a place in Paradise.  “So he will
look at them both.  Then his grave will be widened for him to a distance of
seventy cubits, and it will be filled with greenery until the Day of
Resurrection”.
In contrast, grave of the disobedient will be filled
with darkness.  The disbeliever’s punishment begins with his bad deeds taking
the form of a repulsive looking man and an opening through which he can see the
ugliness of Hell.
Reward and punishment are mighty motivators and the
thought of spending an unspecified amount of time being punished even before
the Day of Judgment arrives is a fearful thing.
The Prophet said “When any one of you dies, he is shown
his eternal abode every morning and evening.  If he is one of the people of
Paradise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the
people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is
your abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.”
Imagine hearing those words.  This is your abode until
Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.  This is a moment that could
either be filled with joy or despair for the time may be long or short, as
Allah wills.  We have been warned and events of that day have been clearly set
out for us.  Those of us who are wise will take heed."

On the Day of Judgment the sun will
be brought low.  Prophet Muhammad informed us that, “The sun will get closer to
the earth until it is only a mile away and the people will perspire according
to the level of their deeds…”.
[1]
The people will be standing together, fearful and suffering from the effects
of the heat.  For a lucky few the suffering will last what feels like seconds,
for others they will begin to feel as if they have been standing in the
scorching rays of the sun for half a lifetime or more.  The lessons entitled “Events
on the Day of Judgement”
[2]
describe in more detail what people will
experience on that Day.   It mentions briefly that there are seven kinds of
people who will be in the shade; the shade of the Throne of Allah.  In these
lessons we will examine these groups of people in more detail.
Prophet Muhammad would talk to his followers about the
Day of Judgment.  He wanted them, and us who follow him today, to be prepared
for what is to come.  In a famous and much quoted
hadith
he reminded us
of the boundless mercy of Allah and seven types of people who would stand
serenely in the shade on the Day of Judgement.
“Allah will give shade to seven [people] on the Day when
there will be no shade other than His (Throne's) shade:  A just ruler; a youth
who grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the
mosques; two who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for that and parting
upon that; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for illegal
intercourse), but responds by saying, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in
charity and hides it, such that his left hand does not know what his right hand
gives in charity; and finally  a man who remembered Allah in private and wept.”
[3]
Before we continue, it is worth mentioning that in most
circumstances when ‘man’ is mentioned both in the Quran and
ahadith
it
refers to both men and women; except where women or men are addressed
separately and specifically.
1.A just ruler.
Justice is a fundamental concept in Islam, along with
tolerance, forgiveness and respect.   Justice means to give every person the
rights he is entitled to believer or non-believer, relative or stranger, friend
or enemy.  This is a concept that every Muslim must apply, not only the ruler. 
God emphasizes justice, and Islam condemns all forms of injustice and
oppression.
“…And do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being
just.  Be just; that is nearer to righteousness”.    (Quran: 5:8)
“…And God wills no injustice to the worlds.” (Quran 3:108)
Being just can put the ruler under a lot of pressure, he
must be careful of his own intentions and actions and he also bears some responsibility
for the actions taken under his authority.
2.A youth who grew up in the worship of Allah.
It is the youth who are the most energetic and
enthusiastic.  They have a zest for life and look to the future, planning and
laying foundations for a long and fruitful life.  Their liveliness and zeal are
great blessings from Allah and those who use this time wisely to gain knowledge
of Allah and perform acts that they may not be able to perform later in life
will be rewarded.  Amongst those rewards is to be shaded on the Day when there
is no shade.  Youthfulness however is also the time when a person is most
vulnerable to the temptations of life and the tricks of
Shaytan
.  There
are many worldly distractions specifically marketed to the young, so they must
keep their eyes on the prize and not be deluded by all that glitters and has no
substance.
We are reminded of this in another
hadith
where Prophet
Muhammad says, “Take advantage of five matters before five other matters: your
youth
before you become old; and your health, before you fall sick; and your wealth,
before you become poor; and your free time before you become busy; and your
life, before your death.”
[4]
3.A man whose heart is attached to the mosques.
Once again there are great rewards for praying in the
mosque.  In various
ahadith
we are reminded of this.  For a man praying
in the mosque has 27 times more reward than praying in the home.
[5]
Prophet
Muhammad said that a person… “does not take a step towards the mosque except
that because of it, he is raised by one rank and one sin is removed from him.  Then
when he prays, the angels do not ceas"

5.    A man who is called by a woman of beauty
and position (for illegal intercourse), but responds by saying, ‘I fear Allah’.
Please note that, as explained in
lesson 1, the same reward is given to a woman who is tempted by a man but
rebukes him saying, “I fear Allah”.  This world is full of temptations and
especially now, in the 21
st
century we are assaulted almost
constantly.  Our dependence on technology forces us to make hard choices.  We
can choose to be led around by the nose by
Shaytan
and his minions or we
can choose righteousness.  The attraction of one gender to the other is an age
old problem, an age old temptation, and many people have been lured into
destruction by failing to resist a thing of beauty.  This is why we find the
rewards for restraint mentioned so often in the
aayaat
(verses) of the
Quran and why Prophet Muhammad warned his
Ummah
about the danger of not
learning self-control.
“But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and
restrained himself from impure evil desires, and lusts. Verily, Paradise will
be his abode.” (Quran 79:40-41)
People enter Paradise, due generally to their
taqwa
of Allah, full respect and obedience to the commands of Allah, and based on
their good conduct.  Most however enter the Hellfire because of the ill use of
the mouth and private parts”.
[1]
Something that is guaranteed to strengthen our resolve
to stay well away from the temptation of the opposite gender is ‘fear of Allah’.
Taqwa
is the word often used to define the concept of fear of Allah.  Prophet
Yusuf (Joseph) was a man with
taqwa
.  It is said that he will be one of
the leaders of the people shaded by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  His way of
dealing with the temptation of the seductress that was his employer’s wife is a
fine example for all of us.  When he found himself tempted by her beauty he
sought refuge with Allah.
“Indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her
desire had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.   Thus, it was that We might
turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse.   Surely, he was one of
Our chosen, guided slaves.” (Quran 12:24)
6.    A man who gives in charity and hides it,
such that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity.
Charity in Islam takes two forms:
zakah
, compulsory
charity and
sadaqah
, voluntary charity.
Zakah
holds such a high
position that throughout the Quran it is often coupled with prayer.  Islam
places great emphasis on the need to give
sadaqah
and
zakah
and
it places great emphasis and great reward on giving these two forms of charity
in secret.  To give in secret preserves the dignity of those who receive and it
also prevents the giver from seeking praise and acknowledgment.  Islam tells us
that giving in secret is by far the superior way but that should not detract
from giving publicly which is also a very desirous and rewardable act however
deliberately drawing attention to one’s charitable deeds is a very undesirable
quality.
Wealth is something that Allah can give to us at any time;
however He can also take it away without even a moment’s notice.  We all know
people that have plunged into bankruptcy overnight.  Because of the high
position charity holds in Islam it is important that we spend our wealth in the
way of Allah before we do not have the means to do so.
The likeness of those who spend their money for Allah’s sake,
is as the likeness of a grain (of corn), it grows seven ears, every single ear
has a hundred grains, and God multiplies (increases the reward) for whom He
wills, and Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All Knower.  (Quran
2:261)
7.    A man who remembers Allah in private and
weeps.
Prophet Muhammad said, “There are two eyes which will
not be touched by the fire, an eye which weeps out of fear of Allah and an eye
that stays alert throughout the night guarding for the sake of Allah”.
[2]
In the first type are those people whose eyes overflow
with tears when they remember Allah.  They weep when they contemplate the sins
that"

Honors of Adam
Allah favored Adam (Quran 3:33) over
other people with some great qualities:
1.Adam was the father of all human beings.  Allah chose him to be
the father of all human beings as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said, “All of you are the children of Adam and Adam was
created from soil.”
[1]
2.Allah created Adam with His Hands.  Addressing Satan, Allah
said, “What prevented you from prostrating yourself to the one whom I created
with both My hands?” (Quran 38:75).
3.Allah created the soul breathed into Adam.  Allah had His angel,
Gabriel, breathe life into him (Quran 15:29, 38:72).
4.Allah had the angels prostrate to Adam (Quran 15:29, 38:72).
5.Allah gave him great amount of knowledge, surpassing what He
gave to the angels (Quran 2:31).
6.Allah gave him residence in Paradise along with his wife, Eve,
and allowed them to enjoy there (Quran 2:35).
7.Adam was the first Prophet to human beings.  Prophet Muhammad said,
“…Adam was a Prophet and received revelation.”
[2]
8.Adam shared one religion with all other Prophets and called to
the same religion, Islam.  They all invited to belief in Allah and worshipping
Allah alone (Quran 21:25, 16:36).
Creation of Adam
Allah told the angels that He was planning to establish
a ‘khalifah’
[3]
on
Earth.  ‘Khalifah’ is a person who is succeeded by others.  They immediately
understood that it would not be Adam alone who will live on Earth, but rather,
it would be a long chain of human beings, many of them will be wicked:
“And (mention, O Muhammad), when your Lord said to the angels,
‘Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.’ They said, ‘Will
You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we
declare Your praise and sanctify You?’ Allah said, ‘Indeed, I know that which
you do not know.’” (Quran 2:31)
The question by the angels was not meant to question
Allah’s wisdom or a result of envy or hatred for humans.  They simply wanted to
understand the purpose of Adam’s creation.  Allah’s response tells us that in
His perfect knowledge, He knew things about Adam that the angels could not
imagine.
The angels feared that Adam was unworthy of becoming a
khalifah
on Earth, Allah
proved to them that it was incorrect and the new creation can surpass them in
knowledge.  The Quran 2:31-33 recounts that Allah taught Adam names of all
created things that the angels did not know.  Allah emphasized to them that
their knowledge is limited and they could only know what He taught them.  When
Adam defeated the angels in the ‘contest of knowledge,’ he earned their respect. 
Thus, they rushed to prostrate to Adam when commanded by Allah.
More On the Creation of Adam
Allah tells us in the Quran 20:55 and 30:20 that He
created us from soil.  Allah gathered different types and colors of soil from
which Adam was to be created.  The Prophet said, ‘Indeed, Adam was created from
three types of solids: black, white, and red.’
[4]
The soil gathered for Adam’s creation was then turned
into clay as mentioned in the Quran 6:2.  The clay was sticky (Quran 37:11).  After
Adam’s clay dried, it became sort of like pottery, making a sound when tapped
(Quran 15:26).
After forming Adam’s clay, Allah fashioned it and set it
in Paradise for a certain duration before He gave it life.  “Satan started
circling the clay, examining its nature.  When he realized it was hollow, he
thought, ‘I’ll conquer this, for it is a creation that cannot hold together.’
‘Cannot hold together’ means that he cannot control himself against desires.
Adam was much larger in size than what human beings are today. 
The Prophet said, ‘Allah created Adam sixty cubits tall, then mankind kept
getting shorter until (it reached a stable height) now.’ (Bukhari, Muslim)
Thus, human beings did not go through stages of evolution.
In several verses of the Quran (2:117, 3:47, 6:73,
16:40, 19:35, 36:82.  40:68), Allah indicates that He brings into existence
with a mere word or command.  Sometimes, instead of fulfilling His command
directly, Allah creates means for fulfilling them.  For people, Allah sends
angels to breathe life into them.  In the case of Adam and Jesus, Allah sent Gabriel
to breathe life into them (Quran 15:29, 38:72).
Life was blown into Adam on Friday.  The Prophet said,
‘Indeed, among your best days is Friday.  On it, Adam was created, and on it he
died.  Also, on it will be the Blow of the Horn and the Shock causing every"

Adam’s Wife
Soon after creating Adam, Allah created his wife, Hawwa
or Eve.  From them, Allah brought forth all human beings (Quran 49:13).  Hawwa
was created from Adam’s rib.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah
be upon him, said, “Take good care of women, because the (first) woman was
created from a bent rib (of Adam), and the most curved part of a rib is its
upper end.  If you insist on straightening it, you will break it and if you
leave it, it will remain bent.  So take good care of women.” (Bukhari)
Adam’s Children
After creating Adam, Allah extracted all his descendants
from his backbone (Quran 7:172).  The Prophet  said, “When Allah created Adam,
He wiped his back, dropping from it every person of Adam’s offspring He would
create until Resurrection Day.”
[1]
Allah Commands Angels to Prostrate to Adam
Allah commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam after He
blew life into Adam.  Allah said to them,
“So when I have proportioned him (Adam) and breathed into him
My soul, fall down before him in prostration.” (Quran 15:29, 38:72)
After giving life to Adam, Allah issued the command to
the angels to prostrate before Adam,
“(Note) when We told the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves before
Adam.’” (Quran 2:34, 17:61, 18:50, 20:116)
When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam,
Satan (or
Iblees
in Arabic) was among them.  The angels immediately
prostrated, but
Iblees
refused (Quran 2:34, 20:116, 15:30-31).  His
first sin was disobeying Allah’s command of prostration.
Iblees
was
never an angel (Quran 18:50); he was a
jinn
but lived among the angels. 
Instead of showing remorse and repenting for his behavior, Allah says,
“So they (the angels) prostrated themselves, except for
Iblees
,
who refused, was arrogant, and (thus) became of the disbelievers.” (Quran 2:34)
Allah gave him a chance to repent; however,
Iblees
went deeper into disobedience and rebellion.  To justify his arrogance, Satan
said that he was better than Adam because fire is better than clay.
Allah expelled
Iblees
from Paradise as punishment.
Iblees
recognized that he deserved immediate
punishment for his outright disbelief and disobedience, but he requested that
his punishment be postponed until Judgement Day.  Allah granted his request for
a great wisdom.
Iblees
announced his evil plan to mislead humanity. 
He announced boastfully to Allah,
“(
Iblees
) said, ‘Because You have put me in error, I
will surely lie in ambush for them (humans) along Your straight path.  I will
then surely assault them from before them and from behind them and from their
right and from their left, and You will find most of them ungrateful (to
You).’” (Quran 7:16-17)
Iblees
blamed Allah for his misfortune, even
though Allah did not take away his freedom of choice.  Allah’s wisdom dictated
that
Iblees
be the trial ‘machine’ for human beings and he was given
extraordinary powers over human beings, but it’s limitation is that he will not
be able to subdue Allah’s true servants.
Allah permitted
Iblees
to pursue his plan.  Once he has
completed his evil scheme, he will abide in Hell with his followers from the
jinn
and human beings (Quran 7:18).
Adam and Hawwa in Paradise
Allah let Adam and Eve dwell in Paradise, the best
residence.  He gave them permission to enjoy its bounties without restriction. 
However, Allah prohibited them from eating one specific fruit,
“We said, ‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and
eat therefrom in abundance from wherever you wish.  But do not approach this
very tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.’” (Quran 2:35)
Soon after Adam and Hawwa started living in Paradise,
Satan unleashed his cunning deception on them.  The two were innocent and did
not know about lying and deception.  Satan took a false oath by Allah and used
their innocence to his advantage.  Satan suggested to them that they could be
like the angels or live eternally in Paradise.  Adam and Hawwa were overcome
with desire and fell into Satan’s trick and ate from the forbidden tree.  As
soon as they did, their private parts became exposed (Quran 2:36).An
immediate outcome of disobedience is the stripping away of the spiritual
clothing of
taqwa
, hence they were punished by losing the physical
garments that covered their private parts.

lessons that are applicable today
.
Arabic Terms:

Nuh
– Arabic name for Prophet Noah.
The name Noah is familiar to all three monotheistic
faiths prevalent in the world today, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  In Islam
the story of Prophet Noah and the flood is very similar to what is found in the
Bible, however the Quran tends to go into greater detail.   When this is
combined with the stories told in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad we are
able to build up a better picture of the life of Prophet Nuh and learn some
very valuable lessons that are as relevant today as they were all those years
ago.
Prophet Nuh lived in a time very similar to our own.  Sin
and lawlessness had seemingly overtaken the people.  Righteous people seemed
very few and those who adhered to the religion of their ancestor Adam were weak
and often oppressed.  It sounds a little bit like the world we live in today
where those who profess belief in God are often ridiculed and belittled and committing
sin is thought of as fun.
Nuh was a charismatic speaker and enthralled the people
with stories of the creation and the mysteries of the universe, however when he
tried to warn his people of a just yet terrible punishment they became angry
and resentful.  These were the first people who had deviated from the true
religion yet when Nuh warned them of the punishment of Allah, his words fell on
deaf ears.  Despite ridicule and mockery Nuh continued, for a period of 950
years, to call his people back to the worship of the one true God.
Lesson 1
Do not ever give up.
Do not ever abandon or cut yourself off from family or
friends because of their disbelief, because Allah only knows when your words or
actions might flip the switch that leads them to the path of salvation.
We all know the story of the flood.   It was told in
almost every ancient civilisation and as mentioned already, forms part of the
religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Allah instructed Nuh to build an
ark and passed judgement on the disbelievers in the form of a flood.   It is a
story quite often thought of as a child’s story, but this story has many layers
of meaning and is relevant for adults. Allah, the Exalted, says:
“And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our
Inspiration and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are
surely to be drowned.” (Quran11:37)
When the water started to fall from the sky and gush
from the earth, for this was no ordinary storm, Allah commanded Nuh to enter
the ark with his family, the believers and a pair of every known animal, bird
or insect.  The disbelievers watched incredulously, still jeering and mocking,
but the words stuck in their throats when the water began to rise, and rise,
and rise.
Lesson 2
There is no power and strength except from Allah.  He is the All-Powerful. 
If He decrees a thing, nothing can prevent it.
While worldly might, strength or respect might seem of
consequence, the reality is that we are weak and needy; what little control we
have over our world and our affairs pales in comparison to the might and
majesty of Allah.
Nuh’s wife did not join him on the ark, for she had
never really believed in the message he had been preaching for so long.   Neither
did his eldest son, an idol worshiper who preferred to climb the highest
mountain he could find, but the water kept rising and rising.  Prophet Nuh
could see his son being overtaken by the waves of water and cried out to him to
embark the ark.   But his son refused, and he drowned.
“And Nuh called out to his son, who had separated himself
(apart), ‘O my son!  Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.’  The son
replied, ‘I will betake myself to a mountain; it will save me from the water.’ 
Nuh said: ‘Today there is no refuge from Allah’s command, except for those on
whom He has mercy.’  And a wave came in between them so he (the son) was among
the drowned.” (Quran 11:42-43)
The examples of Nuh’s interactions with his idolatrous
son and non-believing wife confirm the previous lessons and add a third lesson.
Lesson 3
We choose what we want to believe and how we want to act.
Although we are undoubtedly born with an innate need to
connect with Allah, our spiritual identity is not a forgone conclusion.  We all
reach an age when we can choose our faith, no matter what religion we were born
into.  Once chosen we then live with the consequences of that decision.
On his deathbed Nuh called his remaining sons to his
side and counseled them.
‘Indeed I would give you far reaching advice.  I charge
you to believe that there is no true god but Allah and that if the seven
heavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale and the words “there
is no true god but Allah “ were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the
former.  I warn you against associating partners with God and against arrogance.”

The large majority of Nuh’s people rejected his message,

Dictionary.com defines a miracle as an effect
or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or
natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause.  Islam however
attributes these extraordinary events to the power of Allah.  A miracle is an astonishing
act that can only come about due to direct intervention from Allah Himself.  They
are events brought about by, connected to, or performed by prophets.  Miracles
are not magic, nor are they events bought about by righteous people.  Magic is
by definition a trick or an illusion; whereas, the sometimes unexplained events
brought about by learned righteous people are called
karamat
.
God sent prophets primarily to guide humankind.   They
were humans of outstanding character that the people could emulate and look to
for direction.   They were not gods, demi-gods or saints; they were human
beings charged with a difficult task.   They at times possessed exceptional
characteristics and qualities because they had to face unanticipated trials and
tribulations in order to spread their message to worship Allah Alone.
In order to support His prophets Allah sometimes gave
them extraordinary power.  The Arabic word for miracle is
mu’jizah
meaning
something unique that cannot be resisted.  The miracles granted to the prophets
were not only unique, they were  also pertinent and understandable to the
people to whom they were sent.  When they saw a miracle they knew that it could
not have been performed by an ordinary man.
In the time of Prophet Moses magic and sorcery were very
common in the land of Egypt therefore Moses’ miracles, such as the staff
turning into a serpent and his hand glowing, appealed to the people he was sent
to guide.  Prophet Moses’ encounter with the magicians at Pharaoh’s court
explains the difference between magic and miracles.  When the magicians whose
serpents were a result of trickery and illusion (magic) saw Moses produce a
real serpent they knew at once that it was a miracle.  That is why they fell
down and prostrated to Allah despite knowing that Pharaoh would have them put
to death.
At the time of Jesus, the Israelites were very
knowledgeable in the field of medicine thus  Prophet Jesus’ miracles included
returning sight to the blind, healing lepers and raising the dead.
“And you heal those born blind and the lepers by My leave.   And
behold!  You bring forth the dead by My leave.” (Quran 5:10)
A miracle performed by Allah at the request of Prophet
Jesus explains why Islam says that there are two types of miracles.  Jesus
asked Allah to provide him and his disciples with a table of food.  This event
is discussed in
Surah
5 of the Quran entitled Al-Maidah (The Table Spread). 
It is an example of a miracle performed at the request, or suggestion of the
people, in order to test the truth of the message.
“Jesus, son of Mary!  Can your Lord send down to us a table
spread (with food) from heaven?” (Quran 5:112)
The disciples wanted to spread the message of Jesus by
proclaiming the miracles they witnessed with their own eyes.  Another example
of this type of miracle is when Prophet Saleh’s people requested he bring out
from behind the mountain a she-camel and her offspring.
“We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did
her wrong.” (Quran 17:59)
The second type of miracle occurs without suggestion.  It
includes anything similar to what happened when the tree trunk cried and longed
for Prophet Muhammad.   The
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad contains many
other miracles such as water flowing from his (Prophet Muhammad’s) fingers and
trees deliberating shading him.  Prophet (King) Solomon’s life was also filled
with miracles and wonder.  His kingdom and his abilities were beyond the
capabilities of a human thus clearly showing that God provided him with
miracles that made him stand out among others and confirmed his nobility and
prophethood.   His army consisted of battalions of men,
jinn
and birds.

- the Arabic word for
Abraham.
·
Shaytan
- sometimes spelled
Shaitan
or
Shaytaan
.  It is the word used in Islam and the Arabic language to
denote the devil or
Satan
, the personification of evil.
Prophet Ibrahim was a
Prophet of Allah and he has the honour of being described by Allah as
Khalil-Allah
which means the
one whom God chose for His love.
Throughout various chapters of the Quran Ibrahim is
praised as a paradigm of righteousness.  He was a man whose character is an example
to all believers; he was kind, forbearing, brave and trustworthy. Allah
describes him as such, He says:
Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader, devoutly
obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who
associate others with Allah. (He was) thankful for His (Allah's) Graces. He
(Allah) chose him and guided him to a Straight Path. And We gave him good in
this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. (Quran
16: 120-122)
Lesson 1
Parents can learn from their children and elders can learn
from the youth.
Knowledge and understanding is not necessarily something
that comes with age and just because a person is older does not mean that he or
she is someone to emulate. The way Prophet Ibrahim interacted with his father
is a very good example of a child respecting his parent yet rejecting his (the
parent’s) ways and lifestyle.
And (remember) when Ibrahim said to his father, Azar: “Do you
take idols as gods? Verily, I see you and your people in manifest error!” (Quran
6: 74)
Ibrahim’s father Azar was a sculptor of idols, so from a
young age Ibrahim was aware that idols were nothing more than pieces of wood or
stone – inanimate objects that could extend no benefit or harm. He found it
extraordinary that people would worship them as gods!
Ibrahim tried to convince his father that his practice
of idol worship was wrong and ultimately useless. He  spoke to him in a gentle
voice, using kind words, and he tried to warn him of the dangers inherent in
worshipping idols, but his father only became annoyed and then angry.
When he said to his father: ""O my father! Why do you
worship that which cannot hear or see and cannot avail you in anything? O my
father! Verily! I have received knowledge that you have not received, so follow
me. I will guide you to a Straight Path. O my father, do not worship Satan.
Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient. O my father,
indeed I fear that you will be punished by the Most Merciful and would be a
companion to Satan in Hellfire."" He (the father) said: ""Do you reject
my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop this, I will indeed stone you. So get
away from me safely before I punish you."" (Quran 19: 42-46)
The child feared that his father would be lost and fall
into the clutches of
Shaytan
. He was wise beyond his years yet Ibrahim’s
father did not listen perhaps rejecting the fact that his child could guide and
teach him. Ibrahim did not lose his temper but instead responded to his
father’s threatening attitude with respect and wisdom.
[Abraham] said, ""Peace be upon you. I will implore my
Lord to forgive you. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me. And I shall turn away
from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allah. I will call upon my Lord
and it may well be that, in calling on my Lord, I will not be disappointed.” (Quran
19:47-48)
Lesson 2
Islam is logical.
From the perspective of Islam Prophet Ibrahim is not
considered to be either Jewish or a Christian; he is a Prophet who submitted to
Allah and thus is a Muslim. God tells us in the Quran that from an early age Prophet
Ibrahim felt compelled to find the One God Who was worthy of worship. He
realized that the idols his people worshipped, that were carved and sculptured
by his father were nothing but wood and stone. He knew instinctively that the
sun, moon and stars were not gods of any sort. Islam tells us that worshipping
Allah is the only logical conclusion that a person who examines the evidence,
can come to.  This is exactly what Ibrahim did. First he asked the wooden idols
to respond when he spoke to them and he then destroyed them. They could not speak
or protect themselves. Next he looked to the heavens and tried to find an
answer.
So when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star.
He said, ""This is my lord!"" But when it was no longer visible, he
said, ""I do not like those that disappear!"" When he saw the moon
rising, he said: ""This is my lord."" But when it was no longer visible,
he said: ""Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the people who
went astray."" When he saw the sun rising, he said: ""This is my lord.
This is greater."" But when it set, he said: ""O my people! I disown
all "

·To examine several events and learn valuable
lessons applicable in the 21st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Lut
- the Arabic name of Prophet Lot.
Many stories in the Quran
demonstrate the nature of Allah, some sections teach us about Paradise and Hell
and still other parts of Quran teach us lessons. These lessons are as relevant
today as they were in the time Quran was revealed or even further back in the
history of humankind.  The story of Prophet Lot in both the Bible and the Quran
are remarkably similar. The story of Prophet Lut is one that is particularly
pertinent to the 21st century yet people usually remember very little of the
story.
The story of Lut has over the centuries been reduced to
a morality tale, a parable warning people not to practice homosexuality. 
Usually all we hear is that Lut was a man of Allah living in the town of Sodom whose
people practiced the unnatural act of homosexuality, Allah called such
behaviour an abomination and destroyed the town but not before saving Lut and most
of his family.  However Lut’s story is much more than that, it is a story
filled with lessons for humankind. Let us take a glimpse into his life and see
what messages we are able to find and learn from it.
Lesson 1
Allah destroyed Sodom for crimes and sins we see around us
and accept every day.
We live in a world where murder is common, drugs are
readily available and young girls fall pregnant outside of the bonds of
marriage. Identities are stolen, sinful acts are called fun, and some streets
are unsafe to walk down even in the middle of the day. Paedophilia is rampant,
as is child pornography and human trafficking.  Degenerate lifestyles are
accepted and thought of as normal. Alcohol is easily available even to underage
children and is responsible for many of society’s ills. The people of Prophet
Lut lived in a society very similar to our own.
The town of Sodom was corrupt through and through. The
majority of people had no shame and considered sinful acts to be fun and
frivolity. Sodom was a party town, criminals and criminal activity abounded,
and those passing through the town risked robbery and physical abuse. Rape was
considered normal, homosexuality was considered fun and travellers expecting
hospitality usually got more than they bargained for. Sodom was the equivalent
of the district we avoid at night, perhaps even the suburb police will not
respond to in an emergency.
Lesson 2
To invite people to the truth with wisdom and kind words.
“Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom  and fair
preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better...” (Quran 16:125)
Allah sent Prophet Lot to this town with the message to
worship Allah alone.  He asked them to fear Allah and mend their evil ways
saying,
“Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?  Verily!  I am a trustworthy
Messenger to you.  So fear Allah and obey me” (Quran 26:161 - 163).
Lot
spoke using mild words; he condemned the actions not the people themselves and
encouraged them to seek forgiveness. There is surely a lesson for us in this.
Lot spoke mildly to people Allah described as evil and disobedient, thus we
should remember this when we are confronted with the evil acts people in the 21
st
century think of as fun. Condemn the act, not the person.  This was also the
way of Prophet Muhammad; he too would speak harshly about the action, not about
the person who did the action.
Lesson 3
Allah is the All-Seeing.
Sadly however, in Sodom, Lut’s words fell on deaf ears
because the people were content with their corrupt ways and had no desire to
curb them.  The people of Sodom committed their sins openly and had no shame,
they cared not whether anyone saw their sinful actions so it did not bother
them that Allah was watching. No matter whether we try to disguise or hide our
sins Allah sees everything, nothing can be hidden from the Almighty. Thus if we
are ashamed of our actions and wish that Allah did not witness our behaviour it
is  probably time to rethink,  and  find a way to act that is more pleasing to Allah.
Lesson 4
Believers should be hospitable.
When the angels came into the town of Sodom they
appeared to the people as very attractive male travellers. The first person they
spoke to was one of Lut’s daughters. She was afraid for them and asked that
they wait for her father in order for him to see them to safety. When Lut met
the strangers he could not convince them to bypass the town so he tried to keep
them safe in his own home.  Lut did not know that his guests were angels sent
by Allah, yet he feared for them more than his own safety. When the men of
Sodom rioted outside his house, demanding that the strangers be delivered into
their hands, Lut opposed them.
The goodness in hospitality comes from giving for no
other reason than to please Allah. The person you help may never be in a
position to help you and in some cases he may even bring you harm, however in
Islam hospitality is a triangular relationship between the host, the stranger

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Yusuf and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply
to our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Yusuf
- the Arabic name for Prophet Joseph.
·
Yaqub
– the Arabic name for Prophet Jacob.
·
Surah
– chapter of the Quran.
·
Sabr
- patience and it comes from a
root word meaning to stop, detain,  or refrain.
·
Sabr Jameel
– beautiful patience.
·
Fitnah
- an Arabic word that does not
translate easily into English.   It means a time of trial or tribulation,
particularly a situation that prevents one from worshipping God correctly, or
causes acts of disobedience or disbelief.
The Quran explains the concept of Allah, it explains in
detail what is permissible and what is forbidden, it explains the basics of good
manners and morals, and gives rulings about worship.   It describes Paradise
and Hell and tells stories about the Prophets and our righteous predecessors.  Stories
in the Quran are usually told in small bite size pieces and revealed over
several
surahs
; the story of Prophet Yusuf however
is told in one
surah
from beginning to end.   Although Prophet Yusuf is
mentioned in several places throughout the Quran, this one
surah
,
surah
12 is his complete story and experience.
The essence of
surah
Yusuf is patience,
sabr
in the face of adversity.
Sabr
means accepting what is beyond our
control, something that ProphetYusuf learned from a very young age.   In
times of stress and anxiety, being able to surrender to the will of God is a
relief beyond measure, Yusuf faced hardships first hand, but he did not accept,
sit back and let life pass him by.  He strove to please Allah in all aspects of
his life.   Renowned Islamic scholar Ibnul Qayyim told us that
sabr
means
having the ability to stop ourselves from despairing, to refrain from
complaining, and to control ourselves in times of sadness and worry.  He also was
able to derive 1000 lessons from
surah
Yusuf.
However in this article we will take a glimpse into the
life of Prophet Yusufand examine just three extremely important lessons.
Lesson 1
Allah alone has control over all affairs.
As a young teenager Prophet Yusuf was cast into a well
by his brothers who were jealous of him, and was later picked up by a caravan
and then sold into slavery.  For a more detailed story about the life of
Prophet Yusuf, please see:
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1790/viewall/
His older brothers were jealous of Yusuf’s bond with
their elderly father so they convinced their father to allow Yusuf to accompany
them for fun and games, but their intention was to kill him. One amongst them
however felt the error of their ways and suggested that rather than killing
Yusuf
,
they should cast him into a well.  When found by some passing traveller he
would be sold into slavery, thus rendering him as good as dead to the family.  They
also believed, in their blindness, that the absence of Yusuf would remove him
from their father’s thoughts.
Allah had other plans, so while the brothers
congratulated themselves, He established Yusuf  in the land of Egypt in order
to teach him wisdom and understanding.  The pain and suffering Yusuf felt being
separated from his father and the frightening ordeal of being sold into slavery
were trials designed to mould Yusuf’s character.  They were Yusuf’s first steps
on the ladder to greatness and they established him as a Prophet of Allah.  The
plots and plans of the treacherous brothers were inconsequential.
Lesson 2
True
sabr
is a key to the gates of Paradise.
When Yusuf’s brothers returned to their father and told
him Yusuf had been taken by a wolf, Yaqub’sheart constricted in pain
and fear.  He knew his sons were lying but he had no option except to face that
fear with complete submission to Allah.   He turned to Allah with hope and
patience.  This type of
sabr
is what Islam calls
sabr jameel -
beautiful
sabr
.
“Nay, but your own selves have made up a tale.   So (for me)
patience is most fitting.   And it is God (Alone) Whose help can be sought
against that which you assert.” (Quran 12:18)
Throughout the many years until Yaqub saw his dear son Yusuf
again, he never gave up hope.  At one time when his sons asked if he would
weep
forever
he replied that he only complained of his grief and sadness to Allah,
and that he knew, due to his total reliance on Allah, things that they did not
know.
Lesson 3
Complete trust in Allah must be practiced consistently, in
all situations, good, bad, easy, or difficult.
If we accept that we are no more than slaves of Allah,
put on this earth, to be tried, tested and tempted, life can take on a
completely new meaning.   Both Yusuf and his father Yaqub recognized that God
was the one thing in their lives they could totally rely on.
During his time in the house of one of the top Ministers
of Egypt Yusuf was forced to fend of the sexual advances of his
benefactor/master’s wife.  Yusuf called out to Allah for help.  He said,
“O my Lord"

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Ayub and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply
to our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Ayub
- the Arabic word for Job.
·
Sabr
- patience and it comes from a
root word meaning to stop, detain,  or refrain.
·
Shaytan
- sometimes spelled
Shaitan
or
Shaytaan

·
Jinn
- A creation of Allah that was
created before humankind from smokeless flame. They are referred to at times as
spirit beings, banshees, poltergeists, phantoms and so forth.
The lives of all the
Prophets of Allah are filled with lessons.  Some lessons are as applicable
today as they were in the era in which they were experienced.  The Prophets
came with lessons to be learned and understood, messages, and laws.  Sometimes
the laws changed to accommodate a particular time and place but the main
message that they conveyed was the same.  They instructed their peoples to
worship God alone, and not associate anything or anyone in worship with Him.  The
stories of the lives of the prophets emphasize this basic doctrine of Islam
that God is One.
The story of Prophet Ayub is a little different from the
others that we know.  Through his story, we are able to view humankind’s
struggle on a more personal level.  Allah does not tell us about Job’s methods
of preaching or how his people reacted to his warnings and admonitions.   God
does not tell us about the fate of Ayub’s people.   Instead, He tells us about Ayub’s
sabr
.   He (the Almighty) praises Job by saying,
“Truly!  We found
him patient.   How excellent a slave!  Verily, he was ever oft returning in
repentance to Us!” (Quran 38:44)
Lesson 1
To have
sabr
At this point you are probably thinking that all the
Prophets we have discussed so far in this series of lessons have demonstrated
sabr
and of course you would be correct.   It is one of the most important lessons
to learn and to practice.  However Allah, the Most-Wise uses Prophet Ayub’s story
to touch on some areas that otherwise might be overlooked in the study of the
Prophets of Allah and their patience.  Ayub’s story is one of
sabr
, no
doubt about that, however not patience for minutes, hours, or even days.  Prophet
Ayub was patient for years, literally, with not even the smallest break.  The
scholars differ about just how many years but it seems that seven is the
minimum number of years.  Prophet Ayub bore all difficulties with patience.  To
learn more about Prophet Ayub’s suffering and unwavering patience, please see:
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/2721/
Lesson 2
Is our sincerity and worship of Allah dependent upon His
blessings on us?
Happiness and afflictions are both tests from Allah.  We
face trials and we experience triumphs.  If we remember Allah in our times of triumph,
will we still worship with sincerity when we are faced with loss or suffering. 
This is just what
Shaytan
intends to find out when he suggests that
Allah removes Ayub’s blessings of wealth, health and family.   Job was
committed to daily prayer and would frequently thank Allah for blessings He had
bestowed on him but
Shaytan
was convinced that Ayubwould turn
away from his Lord when he was faced with intense suffering, illness and
distress.  Allah knew his faithful slave would never turn away from his faith
so He allowed
Shaytan
to afflict Ayub with many calamities one after the
other.
Allah makes it very clear that children and wealth are
merely adornments of this brief life and that He will test us through our love
for them.
Wealth and children are the attractions of this worldly life,
but lasting good works have a better reward with your Lord and give better
grounds for hope.  (Quran 18:46)
He can take the adornments of life away from us as
easily as He can provide them for us, thus we should never rely on this worldly
life, or feel secure.  In the story of Ayub, Allah teaches us that worldly
treasures are ultimately worthless; so never allow the adornments of this
material life to take over your heart nor lose sight of what is important. Do
not give preference to the material realm and put aside your worship and
reverence to your Creator.
Lesson 3
Nothing happens without the Will of Allah.
Allah used the life of Prophet Ayub to teach
Shaytan
a lesson.   It is a lesson that we too can take benefit from.  The lesson is
that Allah is the controller of all affairs.  Human beings,
Jinn
or
Shaytan
can plot, or simply make plans, but none of them will come to fruition
without the permission of Allah.  When you read a more complete story of
Prophet Ayub you will notice that
Shaytan
knew this and sought
permission to test Prophet Ayub.
Prophet Ayub understood that whatever calamities befell
him, they were happening with the permission of Allah.  He also had complete
trust in the Mercy of Allah knowing that if he loved and trusted Allah even

Glimpses from the Life of Prophet Musa,https://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/169/glimpses-from-life-of-prophet-musa,"Events from the life of Prophet Musa that teach us

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Musa and discuss them in relation to what advice we can take and apply
to our own lives as Muslims in the 2st century.
Arabic Terms:
·
Musa
- the Arabic word for Moses.
·
Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a direct
connection between the believer and Allah.  More specifically, in Islam it
refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
On a dark night in the
shadow of Mt. Tur, Allah conferred Prophethood on Musa and engaged him in a
short but remarkable conversation.  It was a conversation that taught Musa
lessons about himself, about his world, about the nature of humankind and about
the nature of Allah.  To this day it continues to teach important lessons to
humankind.  On a daily basis, the words of the Quran change lives.  The lessons
learned in the story of Musa are as relevant today as they were thousands of
years ago.
The story of Musa teaches us the importance of trusting Allah;
it demonstrates that Allah’s plans will overcome any triumph, test, or trial,
and it shows us that there is no relief from the torments of this world except with
remembrance and through seeking nearness to Allah.  Reading and studying the
life of Musa reveals that Allah can replace weakness with strength and failure
with victory; and that Allah supports the righteous from sources we can barely
imagine.
Egypt in the lifetime of Musa was the known world’s
superpower.  Wealth and power were in the hands of very few, and the lives and
lifestyles of the majority were of very little consequence.  The political
situation was in some ways similar to the political world of the 21st century. 
In a time when the young people of the world are used as cannon fodder for the
political and military games of the most powerful, the story of Musa is
particularly pertinent.  It teaches us how to obey the commands of Allah and it
teaches us how to survive in a world where religion is less important than
power and acquisition.
To read more detailed information about the life of
Prophet Musa go to:
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/3366/viewall/
Lesson 1
Establish the
salah.
Musa had extraordinary strength of character, even as a
relatively young man he had developed the ability to persevere even in the direst
circumstances.  He had fled Egypt under the threat of death, trudged across the
desert and found a new life in a new land but later circumstances pulled him
back to the land of his birth.  In the dark of the night, in the shadow of a
mountain the light of a fire drew Musa into an amazing dialogue.  Imagine his
shock and surprise when he found himself engaged in a conversation with Allah,
the Al-Mighty.  After commanding that Musa removes his shoes, Allah reminded
him of humankind’s obligation to Him.
“Verily!  I am Allah!  none has the right to be worshipped but
I, so worship Me, and establish prayer (
salah
) for My Remembrance.  (Quran
20: 14)
In this conversation
salah
was prescribed upon Musa
and his followers.
Salah
was also prescribed upon Prophet Muhammad and
his followers in much the same way.  Allah establishes a direct connection
between Himself and Musa before He revealed Musa’s mission to the court of the
pharaoh of Egypt.  Before Allah commands Musa to face his biggest fear He says,
worship Me and remember Me, because I am able to replace weakness with strength
and failure with victory; I will support you from sources unimaginable.
Salah
forges a connection between Allah and the person who prays and it means that
one is never far from the protection of Allah.  In this day and age when our
fears about the future tend to overwhelm us, an unbreakable bond is a thing of
comfort and joy.
Lesson 2
Allah hears our prayer and supplication.
Musawas a man of honour.  Even after walking
across the Egyptian desert exhausted and dehydrated he was able to put the
needs of others before his own.  Instead of sinking down in the shade of a tree
at a desert oasis he helped two young women who were trying to water their
flock of sheep.  However, when his task was finished he sat down heavily and
appealed to Allah for help.  He said, “O Lord, whatever good you can bestow on
me, I am surely in need of it”.  Before his supplication was finished, the help
from Allah was on its way.   Musa was probably hoping for a slice of bread or a
handful of dates but instead Allah gave him safety, provisions and a family.  A
person must never despair of Allah hearing his prayer and supplication.   We
are never alone, just as Musawas not alone when he fled from his land leaving
behind everything.
Lesson 3
If a person accepts that there is no true god but Allah no
sin is unforgiveable.
One part of the story of Musa that has intrigued people
for centuries is the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of the Egyptians. 
When Pharaoh had power, wealth, good health and strength he refused to
acknowledge Allah.  He denied the signs and ridiculed, belittled and threatened

·Sunnah - The word Sunnah has several
meanings depending on the area of study however the meaning is generally
accepted to be, whatever was reported that the Prophet said, did, or approved.
Prophet Abraham, known as Ibrahim in Arabic, was born
around 2,000 years before Jesus close to Ur, 200 miles from Baghdad.  The young
Ibrahim questioned the religion surrounding him.
Like those around him, his father Azar was an idol
worshipper, possibly even a sculptor of them; hence Abraham’s first call was
directed to him.  Born with a child’s uncorrupted belief that the world has a
Lord, Ibrahim was instinctively aware of the truth about Him.
“And mention in the Book (the Quran) Abraham, indeed he was a
man of truth, a Prophet.”
Ibrahim began questioning his father’s idol-worship,
“When he said to his father: O my father!  Why do you worship
that which neither hears, not nor sees, nor can avail you in anything?  O my
father!  Lo!  There has come to me of knowledge that which came not to you.  So
follow me, and I will lead you on a right path.  O my father!  Worship not
Satan.  Lo!  Satan is a rebel to the Beneficent.  O my father!  Lo!  I fear
lest a punishment from the Beneficent should overtake you so that you become a
comrade of Satan.”
[1]
“Do you take idols as gods?” (Quran 6:74)
The reply from his father was natural rejection of a
challenge by another not only much younger than him, but also his offspring, a
challenge made against years of tradition and norm.
He (the father) said:
“Do you reject my gods, O Abraham?  If you do not stop, I will indeed stone
you.  So get away from me safely before I punish you.” (Quran 19:46)
Ibrahim stayed firm in his stance on misdirected worship
of his father and those that surrounded him.  In his rejection of idolatry Ibrahim
began his spiritual journey to the Lord of the Worlds.  Contemplating on the
universe shifted his attention from the creation to the Creator, and with it
came the opportunity to further his call that the only deity which deserved
worship was God, Almighty.  The Quran tells us:
“When the night grew dark upon him, he beheld a star, and
said, ‘This is my Lord!’  But when it set, he said: ‘I love not things that
set.’” (Quran 6:76)
Ibrahim had presented the example of the stars to them, so
incomprehensible to them as to be seen as something greater than man with
attributes of various powers he has not.  But in the setting of the stars Ibrahim
saw their inability to appear as they desired, but rather only at night.
Another example of something even greater is a heavenly
body more beautiful, and larger, visible in daytime as well!  However, the
horizon cut off its majesty:
“And when he saw the moon rising up, he exclaimed: ‘This is my
Lord.’  But when it set, he said: ‘Unless my Lord guides me, I surely shall
become one of the folk who are astray.’” (Quran 6:77)
Then as his culminating example, he brought forth to
contemplate something even bigger, one of the most powerful objects of
creation, without which life itself was an impossibility.
And when he saw the sun rising, he cried: “This is my Lord!  This
is greater!”  But when the sun set, he said, “O my people!  Surely I am free
from that which you associate with God. Verily, I have turned my face towards
Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, away from idolatry, and I am not
of those who associate others with God.” (Quran 6:78)
Thus Ibrahim proved to his satisfaction and the
consternation of his peers that the Lord of the worlds was not to be found in
the creations that their idols represented, but was, rather, the entity who
created them and everything which they could see and perceive; that the Lord
does not necessarily need to be seen in order to be worshipped.  He is an
All-Able Lord, not bound by limitations as the creations found in this world are.
“And We verily gave Ibrahim of old his proper course.”
[2]
However, despite these proofs his people still argued
with him.
[3]
They
said:
“Nay, but we found our wise fathers acting in this way.”
[4]
He denied that one’s ancestors are necessarily right, or
that we should slavishly follow their customs, by saying:
“Verily you and your fathers were in plain error.”
His message was simple:
“Worship God, and keep your duty to Him; that is better for
you if you did but know.  You worship instead of God only idols, and you only
invent a lie.  Lo!  Those whom you worship instead of God own no provision for
you.  So seek your provision from God, and worship Him, and give thanks to Him,
(for) to Him you will be brought back.”
[5]
Then the time came when preaching had to be accompanied
with physical action.  Ibrahim planned a bold and decisive blow at idolatry, a
plan which had hinted involved their idols,
“And, by God, I shall circumvent your idols after you have
gone away and turned your backs.” (Quran 21:57)

·To examine several events in the life of
Prophet Jesus (Isa).
·To understand that Jesus never called
himself God.
·To understand that converting to Islam does
not mean giving up belief in Jesus.
Arabic Terms:
·
Isa
– The Arabic name for Jesus.  A
full explanation can be found here
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1447/
·
Sunnah
- The word Sunnah generally means
whatever was reported of what the Prophet said, did, or approved of.
·
Al-Fatihah
– The opening chapter of
the Quran.
·
Injeel
– the Arabic word meaning Gospel,
in this case referring to the gospels of Jesus, before they were adulterated or
altered over time.
·
Zakah
- obligatory charity.
In Islam,
Isa
is a loved and
esteemed man, a Prophet and Messenger calling his people to the worship of the
One True God.  Muslims and Christians share some very similar beliefs about Isa.
 A full description can be found in this article,
http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1412/
and in other articles on the  same website.  However
Muslims and Christians are worlds apart in one major detail.   Muslims do not
believe that Isais God, or that he is the son of God, or that he is
part of a Trinity.
Lesson 1
Muslims love Isa too
The status of Prophet Isa in Islam
sometimes becomes problematic for many Christians converting to Islam.  Often
it is difficult for them to reconcile old spiritual beliefs for their newly
adopted ones.  The first important lesson that we can learn by glimpsing into
the life of Prophet Isais that he remains a very important person.  One
who loves Prophet Isa can embrace Islam without having to stop loving him.  In
Islam, loving all prophets and messengers is a key Tenet of Faith.
Prophet Isa is
such an influential figure among both Muslims and Christians that it is
possible for Muslims and Christians across the globe to build bridges of understanding,
tolerance, and shared values through their love for this prophet.
Lesson 2
Isa never referred
to himself as God
In both the Christian Gospels, what
Muslims refer to as the
Injeel
, and in the sources of Islam, Isa never
called himself God (Allah) or taught that he was anything other than a Prophet or
Messenger from Allah to the people of Israel.
Isa
taught his followers to
pray to God only, not to himself.  Nor did he indicate that anyone should pray
in his name.
The first of the ten commandments
revealed to Prophet Moses (Musa) was Deuteronomy:4, “Hear, O Israel: The Lord
our God is one Lord”.  This was reiterated and endorsed by Isa in the Gospel of
Mark (12:28 & 29).  “And one of the scribes came, and … asked him, which is
the first commandment of all? And Isa answered him, ‘The first of all the
commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.’“
In the Quran, Prophet Isa says,
“… ‘I
have come to you with wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the
(points) on which you dispute.  Therefore, fear Allah and obey me. Indeed,
Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.  This is a straight path.’”
(Quran 43:63)
In the words from the King James Bible,
when one of Isa’s disciples asked him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught
his disciples.” He replied, “When you pray, say: ‘Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is
in heaven.  Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us the wrong we have
done as we forgive those who wrong us.  Subject us not to the trial but deliver
us from the evil one.’“ (Luke 11:1-4, Matthew 6:9-13)
Isa was
teaching his followers what Christianity refers to as “The Lord’s Prayer”, a
prayer that Christians esteem in much the same way as Muslims think of the
opening chapter of Quran,
Al-Fatihah
.
Lesson 3
A brotherly bond exists between Prophets Isa
and Muhammad
Like Isa son of Mary, the Prophet
Muhammad came to confirm the message of all the Prophets before him; he called
the people to worship the One God.  In his
Sunnah
Prophet Muhammad
refers to the relationship that exists between all of the prophets of Allah as
a brotherhood. But when he spoke about Prophet Isa, he said:
“I am nearest
to the son of Mary in this world and the Hereafter.  There is no prophet
between him and me.
“
[1]
He also said,
“Whoever testifies
that there in none worthy of being worshipped but God, Who has no partner, and
that Muhammad is His slave and Prophet, and that Jesus is the Slave of God, His
Prophet, and His word
[2]
which
He bestowed in Mary and a spirit created from Him; and that Paradise (Heaven)
is true, and that the Hellfire is true, God will eventually admit him into
Paradise, according to his deeds.”
[3]
God says in the Quran:
“Jesus, Son
of Mary, is only a Messenger of Allah, and a fulfilment of His command, 'Be',
which He conveyed to Mary, and he is a soul from Him, like the souls of the
rest of humans.”
[4]

inequalities and injustices in their respec"

After years of unsuccessful preaching and anguish at the
probable fate of his father in the Hereafter, tenderhearted Ibrahim kept his
promise to pray for his father.  It was a promise Allah rejected in the end (Quran
9:113-114).  When Ibrahim left behind Harran and the idolaters, he provided and
example for us.  Allah recommends part and warns against part of what he announced:
“Indeed there is for you a good example in Ibrahim and those
with him, when they said to their people: ‘We are clear of you and of that
which you serve besides Allah.  We disbelieve in you and there has arisen
enmity and hatred between us and you forever until you believe in Allah alone’
- except for the saying of Ibrahim to his father, ‘I will surely ask forgiveness
for you, but I have not (power to do) for you anything against Allah.’”
[1]
Ibrahim migrated to Egypt, where he met the Pharaoh.  Sarah,
a beautiful and and charming woman, attracted the attention of the Pharaoh.  When
asked about his relationship with Sarah, Ibrahim replied that she was his
sister - he meant his sister in faith.  Through her, a statement was about to
be made to the Egyptians to submit to Allah.  Thinking she was available for
his use, the Pharaoh quickly summoned Sarah who, on Ibrahim’s instructions,
kept quiet about her relationship with him.  Sarah, however, was a chaste
woman, and she turned to Allah in prayer.  The moment Pharaoh reached for
Sarah, his upper body paralyzed.  He cried to Sarah in distress, promising to
release her if she would release him!  She, however, simply prayed to Allah for
his release, to demonstrate that only He has the power, if He wills, to protect
her.  Only after a failed third attempt did he finally let her go.  Sarah
returned to Ibrahim, accompanied by Hagar, a gift from Pharaoh to propitiate one
so protected by Allah.  She had delivered a powerful message to the pagan
Egyptians, yet still the Pharaoh misdirected his propitiation, which should
have been directed towards Allah.
Loaded with gifts, Ibrahim returned to Palestine.  Yet Sarah
and Ibrahim continued to be childless, despite divine promises that he will
have many descendants.  Driven by altruism, Sarah suggested that Ibrahim take
Hagar, her handmaiden, as a second wife to bear him a child on her behalf.  While
in Palestine, Ibrahim married Hagar who bore him a son, Ishmael.
While Ishmael was still nursing, Ibrahim was commanded
by Allah to take Hagar and Ishmael to a barren valley of Bakka 700 miles
southeast of Hebron.  In later times it would be called Mecca.  Ibrahim left
them there with a skin of water and leather bag full of dates.  As Ibrahim
began walking away leaving them behind, Hagar became anxious about what was
happening.  Ibrahim did not look back.  Hagar chased him,
‘O Ibrahim, where
are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company
we can enjoy, nor is there anything here?’
Ibrahim hurried his pace.  Finally,
Hagar asked,
‘Has Allah asked you to do so?’  Suddenly, Ibrahim stopped,
turned back and said, ‘Yes!’
Feeling a degree of comfort in this answer,
Hagar asked,
‘O Ibrahim, to whom are you leaving us?’  ‘I am leaving you to
Allah’s care,’
Ibrahim replied.  Hagar submitted to her Lord,
‘I am
satisfied to be with Allah!’
[2]
She
traced her way back to little Ishmael.  Ibrahim left with prayers for his wife
and child, which he prayed when he was out of sight.
Soon, the water and dates were gone and Hagar’s
desperation increased.  Unable to quench her thirst or to breastfeed her little
baby, Hagar began searching for water.  She began climbing the rocky incline of
a nearby hill.  ‘Maybe there is a caravan passing by,’ she thought to herself. 
She ran between the two hills of Safa and Marwa seven times looking for signs
of water, and then she heard a voice.  Looking down in the valley, she saw someone
standing next to Ishmael.  It was the angel Gabriel,  who hit the ground next
to the baby with his heel as she came rushing down the hill, and water came
gushing out.  It was a miracle!  Hagar tried to make a basin around it to keep
to from flowing out and filled her skin.
‘Do not be afraid of being
neglected,’ the angel said, ‘for t"

While the majority of Muslims share the same fundamental
beliefs, with 1.62 billion adherents –close to a quarter of planet Earth’s
population
[1]
– distributed over the far stretches of the continents and among 49 countries
where Muslims are a majority and a history of more than a thousand years, all people
who call themselves Muslims are not exactly the same.  There are sometimes
significant religious differences between them.  In the following two lessons, we
will cover the following points in more detail:
Do the existence of sects mean that Islamic teachings
(contained in Quran and
Sunnah
) mandate them? The answer is no.  What is
important is to realize that unlike other religions, Allah has taken upon
Himself to protect Islam - the last revelation and the most complete religion
of God to humanity.  You will not find any promise from God in the Bible or
almost any other religious text that He will protect it.  On the other hand,
you do find two important promises from God in the Quran:
“God has completed His religion of Islam” (Quran 5:3)
God will protect and safeguard His religion form change (Quran
15:9)
The existence of sects is due to reasons whose
discussion is beyond this lesson.
All Sects are Not Equal: An Analogy of Circles
An analogy can better explain the issue of sects.  The
Quran and
Sunnah
sit at the center around which there are many circles. 
Some Muslims will lie within a circle, but others will lie outside of it.  In
other words, some Muslims will be closer to the center, others may be distant. 
Then, think of a red circle which is so far from the center that anyone who
lies outside of that red circle is not even considered a Muslim.  The radius of
the circle is a measure of how “deviant” the sect is.
In other words, the most “deviant” sects, one can call
them cults, will be outside of the red circle.  They will be the ones that have
the most serious conflict with the established Islamic beliefs and practices.  Examples
would be Ahmadis, Bahais, and the Druze.
Sects Are Confusing, Who Do I Follow?
What becomes confusing is that with the existence of
different sects, who does a new Muslim follow, especially when most sects claim
to follow the Quran and
Sunnah
.  What is a new Muslim to do? How does he
or she determine who is right and who is wrong? In simple words, how does a new
Muslim avoid confusion? Let us break down the answer to this question in a few
points:
First
, if we go back to the Quran and
Sunnah
,
we will find the answer to this question.  You see, the Quran and
Sunnah
are texts; some will try to take the Quran alone, separating it from the
Sunnah
(Prophetic traditions). They would then interpret the Quran they way they like.
The only way to properly understand the Quran is by going back to the Prophetic
traditions and to understand both in light of the understanding of the people
who were present at the time of revelation.  These texts were revealed in their
time, many of the texts were addressed to them
[2]
,
and they had the best teacher (the Prophet of Allah) to explain to them anything
that needed explanation.  Let us see what the Prophet said regarding this
matter,
“The best of people is my generation, then those who
come after them, then those who come after them.” (Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh
Muslim)
The Prophet distinguished the first three generation of
Muslims to be the “best.” If they are the “best” according to the Prophet of
Islam, then it makes sense that we understand and practice Islam the way the
“best” people understood and practiced Islam.
Second
, it is important to know that the first
generation of Islam is known as the generation of the “
Sahabah
.” The
word “
sahabah
” means “companions” in Arabic.  Its singular is “
sahabi
,”
which means a “companion.” The second and third generation also have names, but
“
sahabah
” is the most important term to know for now.
Third
, it is important that one not judge for
himself who is Muslim and who is not. When one lacks the proper knowledge,
issues such as this should be left to the scholars. There are some sects that
do have good and bad incorporated into their beliefs. Take Sufis

as an example.

Signs of Deviant Sects
While there is no easy way to tell who belongs
to what sect, the following are some guidelines that warrant caution:
1.Disregard for proofs and evidences based on the Quran and
Sunnah.
2.Speaking badly about the
sahabah
(companions) of the
Prophet.
3.Following personal desires and putting them ahead of the Quran
and
Sunnah
.
4.Not paying attention to Islamic Monotheism and hating those who
do.
5.Creating division among the Muslims.
6.Rejecting the teachings (
Sunnah
) of the Prophet Muhammad,
claiming the Quran is sufficient.
7.Putting another person (usually the leader of the sect) at the
same level of Prophet Muhammad in terms of love, respect, and obedience.
8.Hating the scholars of Islam.
Examples of Sects Influential in the West
As mentioned earlier, not all sects are equal. Even
within a sect, there are sub sects that vary greatly in their teachings.
Keeping this in mind, below is a brief discussion of some sects:
1.Ahmadis
[1]
Ahmadis or Qadiyanis are a missionary-oriented sect of Indian
origin, founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1839-1908). The Qadiyanis currently have
a presence in many countries, including most Western countries. Their world
wide numbers are estimated as high as 10 million. Even though their
headquarters are in Pakistan, they have a strong presence in London, UK.
2.Ismailis
Also known as “Sevener Shi'ites.” The Ismailis reject
the Quran and all forms of prayers found in the main Sunni Islamic tradition.
This frees them from obligations such as prayer, fasting, and hajj. They are
mostly located in Pakistan, North-west India and the Chinese province of
Sin-Kiang. The Khojas, a sub-sect, are mainly to be found in Gujarat, India.
There are also Khoja communities in East and South Africa. They are also found
in the Western countries. Most Ismaili businesses put the picture of Prince
Karim Agha Khan, their leader, at a prominent place in their shop.
3.Bahais
[2]
Bahais follow the teaching of Bahaullah ('splendor of
God') (1817-1892). They attract followers by speaking of unity of humanity and
the absolute equality of men and women. Bahais see themselves working towards
the establishment of a world government which will eradicate extremes of wealth
and poverty. The writings of Bahaullah are treated as sacred. It is estimated
that there are between 3 to 4 million Bahais in the world today, spread in most
countries of the world with the largest concentration in India. In Iran the
Bahais remain the largest minority group with about 300,000 adherents. The
international Baha'i center is in Israel.
4.Shias
[3]
Also spelled “Shi’ites.” The “Twelver Shias” believe
that, after the death of the Prophet, the Imamate (the political and religious
leadership of the Muslim community) should have gone to 'Ali - the cousin and
son-in-law of the Prophet - and his descendants as a divine right.
Unlike
the Sunnis, who perform prayers five times a day, the Shi'ites pray three times
a day. The Twelver Shias population in 1980 was estimated to be 73,000,000.
They are dominant in Iran, but are also found in Pakistan, India, Iraq,
Lebanon, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Syria. There are also small Shia communities
in the West, one of the largest in Dearborn, Michigan.
5.Nation of Islam
[4]
The Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace Muhammad in
Detroit in 1930. The group believes that a person called Fard Muhammad was “God
on earth.” It sees Elijah Muhammad as the ""Messenger of Truth.""
Warith Deen Mohammed, the son of Elijah Muhammad, brought the group closer to
mainstream Sunni Islam. Some dissatisfied members were led by Louis Farrakhan,
who revived the group in 1978 with the same teachings of Elijah. They only
allow people of black ethnicity in and believe they are the original race on
earth. They are especially popular in the prison system in the US.
6.Submitters
Founded by Dr. Rashad Khalifa, an Egyptian computer
scientist. Submitters consider Rashad Khalifa to be a Messenger of God. They
reject two verses of the Quran, preach the “miracle of 19,” and reject the
hadith

Bidah
is an Arabic word that comes from the root
Al-Bada’
meaning to create something without precedence.  In English we would use the
word “innovation”. Before discussing
bidah
in any depth we must
distinguish between two types of
bidah
. The first type is innovation in
the matter of things pertaining to our worldly life. Things like technology,
electricity and transport would come under this category. These things are
permissible and in many cases could even be called desirable. The second type
of innovation pertains to matters of the
deen
. In matters of religion
bidah
is not permissible and it can be dangerous to introduce new things in our
religion. Because of the danger there are many quotations and traditions from
the
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad that point this out.
“Whoever innovates into this affair of ours
something that we have not commanded, it is to be rejected”.
[1]
The best speech is the Book of Allah and the best
guidance and example is that of Muhammad, and the worst of all things are the
newly invented things (in the religion), for every religious innovation is an
error and a misguidance.”
[2]
“…Every religious innovation is a means of
misguidance and every means of misguidance is in the fire.”
[3]
The
deen
of Islam has no need for
bidah
. The
religion of Islam is complete and there is no need to introduce or invent new
matters in the religion. This is confirmed by the Quranic statement
“This
day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and
have chosen for you Islam as your
deen
” (Quran 5:3)
When a person innovates something and adds to the
deen
something that does not already belong to it, he implies that the religion is
lacking and in need of improvement, or the implication is that Allah did not
complete and perfect it His religion. This is clearly not the case as we can
see from the above verse.
Why is it important to avoid
bidah
Whilst Allah does not punish a person who falls into
error due to ignorance we are obligated to educate ourselves to the best of our
ability. The reality is that Allah will not accept an action that does not
fulfil two important conditions. The first condition is that the action be done
with a sincere intention to please Allah almighty. The second is that the
action is done according to what is taught in the Quran and the authentic S
unnah
of Prophet Muhammad. The action must conform to the
Sunnah
and not be in
contradiction to it.
With this in mind let us revisit the meaning of
bidah
.
 Linguistically, it means creating or inventing something new, something
without precedence.  Legally, it is to add something new to the
deen
of
Allah. Even if the action is invented as a way of drawing closer to or
worshipping Allah it still does not become acceptable. It is still a sin.
How do we know if an act of worship is really an act of
bidah
?
On many occasions you will hear it said that Islam is a
religion of informed knowledge. This implies that believers do not take things
on face value. A believer takes the time to learn and understand the details of
the
deen
and he learns to question actions or sayings that are not
presented with clear evidence. If he takes the time to learn Islam a person is
able to recognise what is a
Sunnah
action and what is
bidah
.
The following are six ways to distinguish between a
Sunnah
and a
bidah:
1.An act of worship related to a cause or reason that has not been
legislated:
It is not
permissible to link an act of worship to a cause or reason that has not been
legislated in the Quran or the authentic
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad.  An
example of this would be waking up to pray at night during the seventh day of
the Islamic month of
Rajab
with the belief that Prophet Muhammad
ascended to the heavens on this night. The act of praying in the night is
something that is legislated in Islam with sufficient evidence from the Quran
and
Sunnah
, however when it is linked to this reason it becomes a
bidah
because it is based and constructed upon a reason which is not established from
the
Shariah
.
2.Type of worship:
It is also essential that the act of worship agrees with
the
Shariah
in its type. If a person was to worship Allah with an act of
worship whose t"

How do we know if an act of worship is really an act of
bidah
?
3.  Quantity of worship:
Another way to recognize the difference between a
Sunnah
and a
bidah
is based on the quantity of worship. If a person decided to
pray five
rakahs
of prayer for the
Dhuhr
prayer this would be a
bidah
.
We know that this prayer consists of four
rakahs
; this is what is
legislated and to introduce an extra unit of prayer would be considered an
innovation, a
bidah
.
4.Manner of performance of worship:
Another way of distinguishing between something that
originates in the Quran and the
Sunnah
and an innovation is to look at
the manner of performance. That is, how do we perform the act of worship, is it
in accordance with what the
deen
of Islam teaches, or have we overstepped
the boundaries and added something to a religion that has already been
perfected. An example of this is making ablution before prayer in an incorrect
order, such as beginning with washing the feet instead of finishing with this.
5.Time of worship:
The time we perform an act of worship is also important.
If a worship is performed according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and
the specified time, then it does indeed please our Creator. However if a person
takes it upon himself to change the specified time then that person has fallen
into the sin of
bidah
. For example, sacrificing sheep in the month of
Ramadan
with the intention of seeking a reward similar to the reward for sacrificing on
Eid ul-Adha
then this would be considered an innovation.
6.Place of worship:
The place in which the act of worship is performed
should also be in accordance with what has been legislated. If, for example a
person was to make
itikaf
in his home this would not be acceptable. The
place for
itikaf
is the mosque, thus performing it in any other place
would be considered a
bidah
.
A list of common innovations
·Seeking help from the occupants of the grave.
This
bidah
is of particular importance because it also encompasses
shirk
,
the greatest sin in Islam.
·Sitting in groups and saying words of
remembrance of Allah, such as Allahu Akbar, in unison.
·Taking the birthday of the Prophet as an
Eid
.
·Fasting on the fifteenth of the Islamic
month of
Shaban
and spending that night in prayer.
·Celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.
·Reciting Quran to benefit the deceased (this
includes hiring people to recite Quran).
·Wiping over the back of the neck when making
ablution.
·The family of the deceased preparing food
for others who visit.
What is a “good
bidah
”?
On occasions you might hear  of something called a ‘good
bidah
’. According to Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him,
“… there is no such thing in Islam (in the religious sense) as a good
bidah
.”
[1]
The sheikh also emphasised that “…with regard
to ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called
bidah
(innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic
terms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not
the things that the Prophet was warning us against”. In addition to this noted
Islamic scholar Imam Ibn Rajab
[2]
said, “Any words from our righteous predecessors considering something as a good
bidah
were meant in a linguistic sense and not the Islamic sense”.
In conclusion
bidah
is a newly invented belief or
action in the
deen
of Islam by which closeness to Allah is sought but it
is not supported by any authentic proof "

Introduction
Linguistically, theterm
Adhan
means “a
proclamation”, and this is what is meant in the verse of the Quran:
“And a
proclamation
(adhan) from Allah and His
messenger to all people on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage that Allah is free
from (all) obligations to the polytheists, and so is His messenger.” (Quran
9:3)
In religious context, the
adhan
is that proclamation
made, consisting of specific “words of remembrance”, the time for an obligatory
salah
has begun. Throughout the Muslim world and in some places in the
West, the caller to prayer announces five times a day from every mosque that it
is time for prayer, to remember Allah, and to put aside all the cares of life
to prepare for the worship of the Giver of Life.  The prayer “God is the
Greatest” resonates through all semblances of civilization, through small towns
to metropolises.
The
adhan
covers all the essentials of the Islamic
faith in a few words:
1.    It begins by proclaiming the greatness of
Allah.
2.    It testifies to Allah’s
tawheed
and
His exclusive right to worship.
3.    It denies
shirk
– the worship of
everything besides Allah.
4.    The
adhan
testifies that Muhammad, may
the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, is the Messenger of Allah.
5.    It mentions belief in one of the greatest
pillars of Islam: the
salah
(ritual prayer).
6.    Invites to the prayer and equates it with
prosperity, salvation and success (in the hereafter)
7.    It affirms the reward for
salah
:
prosperity for one who singles out Allah in
tawheed
, follows His
Messenger, establishes the
salah
and other pillars of Islam.
8.    It implies the loss of one who does not
respond to the
adhan
and does not pray.
History of
Adhan
The
adhan
was prescribed during the first year after
the Prophet migration to Medina.  It was taught in true visions to two
companions and made part of Muslim life by the Prophet himself.  Abdullah ibn
Zaid, a companion of the Prophet, reported:
“When the Prophet was
to order the use of a bell to call the people to prayer, he disliked it because
it resembled the Christian practice.  While I was sleeping, a man came to me carrying
a bell.  I said to him, ‘O slave of Allah, will you sell me that bell?’
He said, ‘What would
you do with it?’
I replied, ‘I would
call the people to prayer with it.’
He responded, ‘Shall I
not guide you to something better than that?’
I said, ‘Certainly.’
He said, ‘You should
say:
Allahu akbar, Allahu
akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar
Ashhadu alla ilaha illal-lah,
ashhadu alla ilaha illal-lah
Ashhadu anna
Muhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah,
ashhadu anna
Muhammadar-Rasool-lal-lah
Hayya ‘alas-salah,
hayyah ‘alas-salah
Hayya ‘alal-falah,
hayya ‘alal-falah
Allahu akbar, Allahu
akbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’
Then he went a short
distance away and said, ‘When you stand for the prayer, say:
Allahu
akbar,
Allahu akbar
Ashhadu alla ilaha
illal-lah
Ashhadu anna
Muhammad ar-Rasool-lal-lah
Hayya ‘alas-salah,
hayya ‘alal-falah
Qad qaamatis-salah,
qad qaamatis-salah
Allahu akbar, Allahu
akbar. La ilaha illal-lah.’
When the morning came, I went to the Messenger of
Allah to tell him what I had seen.  He said, ‘Your dream is true, Allah willing. 
Go to Bilal, tell him what you have seen, and tell him to make the call to
prayer, for he has the best voice among you.’ I went to Bilal and told him what
to do, and he made the call to prayer.  ‘Umar was in his house when he heard it. 
He came out with his cloak, saying ‘By the One who has raised you with the
truth, I saw similar to what he saw.’ The Prophet said, ‘All praise is to
Allah.’”
[1]
The Prophet appointed two companions to call the
adhan
in Medina in his mosque: Bilal, a former African slave whose freedom was bought
by Abu Bakr, and Ibn Umm Maktum for the
adhan
of
Fajr
.  He also
appointed Abu Mah-zura in Mecca and Sa’ad al-Qaraz in Q"

The
masjid
, translated as
mosque in English, is the heartbeat of the Muslim society in Islam. In the
West, most often Muslims buy land and build a
masjid
on it. Other times,
they buy a church or some other building and convert it into a
masjid
.
Sometimes, they even rent a room, garage, or a basement and use it as makeshift
masjid
.
In all cases, a
masjid
is a place for Muslims where
they meet one another daily to perform the prayers and also to conduct other
acts of worship and activities that are beneficial for the Muslim community.
The most important act of worship done in the
masjid
is the Friday prayer. Five daily prayers are also offered in most of them. Many
masjids
will have a dedicated
imam
, a prayer leader, who will
lead the daily prayers. Some of them do not have a dedicated
imam
, but one
of the attendees will lead the prayer when the prayer time comes. Similarly,
the regular
imam

Friday sermon.
Prophet Muhammad taught us that the
masjids
are houses
of Allah and that certain etiquettes and rules should be learned and observed
by every Muslim who attends them.
Following are some of the etiquettes and manners of a
masjid
:
1.    Worship is the first priority. The primary purpose
of going to the
masjid
is to worship the One true Lord of the heavens
and the earth. Everything else is secondary. Many mosques provide gaming and
social events like basketball, community dinners, picnics, etc. They are all
worthwhile, but serve a secondary purpose. The
masjid
is primarily a
place for the worship of Allah and that typically means prayer and reading or
reciting the Quran.
2.    The general rule is that a Muslim should be
clean, wear clean clothes, and not smell bad when he or she comes to the mosque.
He should avoid everything that has an offensive smell like that caused by eating
raw garlic, raw onions, or smoking.
A Muslim should also wear clean clothes and socks when
he comes to the
masjid
. Not only do bad smells bother fellow human
beings, but they also offend the angels who are present. Remember, that a
masjid
is the house of Allah after all.
If a person performs work that makes him sweat or other
bodily odors, then he should take a shower and change clothes before coming to
the
masjid
. It is reported that the Prophet Muhammad said:
""Whoever eats garlic or onion, then he must
keep away from our
masjid
because the angels get offended from what
offends the children of Adam."" (Saheeh Muslim)
3.    A Muslim should enter the
masjid
with
his right foot first, and then say what was reported from Prophet Muhammad:
“
Allah-hum-maf-tah lee abwaaba
rahmatik
.”
“O Allah, open the gates of your Mercy
for me.”
This supplications is optional, however saying it is a
rewarding act.
The Prophet liked to start with his right side in everything.
The famous companion of Prophet Muhammad, Ibn Umar, in imitation of the Prophet
used to step with his right foot first when he entered the
masjid
, and
step out with his left foot first when he walked out of the
masjid.
(
Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
).
4.    In order to keep the carpet clean, where people
put their faces, it is appropriate to remove one's shoes before entering the
prayer hall. This goes for children as well, who may drag dirt all over the
carpet - not to mention that they shouldn't be running around inside the prayer
hall.
Many mosques have a rack for shoes that should be
utilized to keep the space clear of shoes in walkways and other spaces. It also
makes it easier to find shoes later on.
5.    A Muslim should greet people by saying “
As-Salamu
Alaikum
” to the people in the
masjid
as he enters it, even if he
sees the people are praying. He does not have to shout it out. Saying it in an
audible voice is enough. The Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say “
As-Salamu
Alaikum
” to the Prophet while he was praying, and he used to reply with a gesture.
There are many reports about that. For example, Suhaib, a Companion of the
Prophet, said: ""I passed by the Messenger of Allah while he was praying
and gave
Salam
to him, (and) he replied to me with a gesture."" (Nasai)
In another instance, Ibn Umar asked Bilal, another
Companion of Prophet Muhammad, ‘How did you see the Prophet reply to the Companions
when they said
Salam
to him while he was engaged in prayer?"" Bilal
said: ""By spreading his palm."" (
Tirmidhi
)

the Friday prayer, the regular prayers, or attending lectures and classes. Late

Basics of the voluntary prayers known as
nafl
will be taught in this lesson.
Objectives
·To appreciate the difference between
nafl
and
fard
worship.
·To appreciate the benefits of
nafl
worship.
·To learn about the commonly prayed voluntary
prayers.
Arabic Terms
·
Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha
– the
names of five daily prayers in Islam.
·
Fard
– an obligatory duty.
·
Nafl
– a voluntary act of worship.
·
As-Sunan ar-Rawatib
– the extra
prayers done by the Prophet before and after the daily obligatory prayers.
·
Rakah
- unit of prayer.
·
Tasleem
– the salutation of peace
that ends the prayer.
·
Duha
– name of an optional prayer
done during the daytime.
The first thing to understand is the difference
between what is known as
fard
and what is known as
nafl
.
Fard
is obligatory, it is what Allah requires us to do, and leaving it is a sin and
we will be held accountable for it.  An example is two
rakah
of
Fajr
prayer.
Nafl
literally means ‘extra’.
Nafl
worship is not
required from a Muslim, rather it is up to the individual to offer it.  It is
optional and voluntary.  The Muslim is not sinful for neglecting
nafl
,
but is rewarded for doing it.  Therefore,
nafl
worship is recommended.  Examples
of
nafl
prayers will be covered in this lesson.
A word of advice about the voluntary prayers.   Add them
slowly to your daily, obligatory prayers.  You must first focus on the five
daily, required prayers and make sure you are praying them regularly and on
time.  Add them step by step, do not burn yourself out, and at the same time do
not neglect the voluntary prayers.
Benefit of
Nafl
Prayers
The Prophet said: “The first thing that the people will
be called to account for on the Day of Resurrection will be the prayers.  Our
Lord will say to the angels although He knows better: ‘Look into the prayer (formal
obligatory prayer) of my servant to see if he observed it perfectly or has been
negligent in it.’ So if he observed it perfectly it will be recorded to his
credit, but if he had been negligent in it in any way, Allah would say: ‘See if
My servant has any extra prayers.’ Then if he has any extra prayers, Allah
would say: ‘Make up the deficiency in My servant’s obligatory prayer with his
supererogatory prayers.’ Thereafter all his actions will be examined in like
manner” (Abu Dawud).
Two Types Of
Nafl
Prayers
a)    General
nafl
prayers:  One can pray
them whenever one likes and there does not have to be any reason or cause for
it, neither are they restricted to any given number.   However it should be
noted that the general
nafl
prayers should not be offered at the time
when performing non obligatory prayers is prohibited or disliked.
b)   Specific
nafl
prayers:  These prayers are
associated with a specific reason or cause.
Examples of Commonly Prayed Specific
Nafl
Prayers
As-Sunan ar-Rawatib
(often simply referred to as  ‘
Sunnah
prayers’)
They are voluntary prayers that are associated with the
obligatory prayers and have a specific order and number.  The ones often prayed
are listed below:

The
Messenger of
Allah said:
“Whoever prays twelve
rakah
during the day and night
will have a house built for him in Paradise: four
rakah
before
Dhuhr
and two after it, two
rakah
after
Maghrib
, two
rakah
after
Isha
, and two
rakah
before
Fajr
.” (
Tirmidhi
)
The Prophet said
about the two
rakah
before the obligatory
Fajr
prayer
, “They
are dearer to me than the whole world.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
“The Prophet never left praying four
rakah
before
Dhuhr
and two
rakah
before
Fajr
under any
circumstances.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Witr
Prayer
The Prophet prayed and encouraged others to pray the
Witr
prayer.  It is a
nafl
and highly emphasized optional prayer, and according
to some scholars it is a required prayer.
It is offered after
Isha
prayer and can be prayed
before the time for
Fajr
prayer starts.
It is permissible to perform the
Witr
by:
1.Praying two
rakah
like any other two
rakah
prayer,
concluding them with
tasleem
and then praying one more
rakah
and ending
the prayer with
tasleem
.
2.Praying three
rakah
continually (
without
sitting
after the second
rakah
as in
Magrib
) and then concluding the
prayer with
tasleem.
3.One
rakah
and ending the prayer with
tasleem
.
Tahiyya-tul-Masjid
(Prayer for Entering the Mosque)
It is a prayer in which two
nafl
rakah
are
performed at the time of entering the mosque.  The Messenger said,
“If
anyone of you enters a mosque, he should pray two
rakah
before sitting.”
(
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Salat at-Tawba
(Prayer of Repentance)
Allah’s Messenger
said,
“There is no man who, upon committing a sin, purifies himself and
performs two
rakah
, then asks for forgiveness from Allah, but Allah
forgives him” (
Abu Daud, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah
)

Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a
direct connection between the believer and Allah. More specifically, in Islam
it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
·
Rukn

·
Wajib
- (plural:

The scholars categorize different actions and sayings of
the prayer into essential components (
arkan
), obligatory acts (
wajibaat)
,
and recommendations.
The difference between a
rukn
(essential component) and a
wajib
(obligatory act) is that a
rukn
cannot
be waived, whether one omits it deliberately or by mistake,
rather it must be done. A
wajib
(obligatory act) is waived if one
forgets, and it can be compensated for by doing the “prostration of
forgetfulness” (will be discussed later).
In this lesson we will first learn the
arkan
(essential
components).
Essential Components (
Arkan
)
of
Salah
1. Saying ‘
Allahu Akbar
’ at the beginning
The Prophet said to a person who prayed incorrectly, “then
face the
qiblah
and say
Allahu Akbar.
”
[1]
2. Reciting
Surah
al-Fatihah
The Prophet said,  “There is no prayer for someone who
does not recite the Opening of the Book (
Surah
al-Fatihah).”
[2]
3. Standing during obligatory prayers if one is able to do so
Based on the verse,
“and stand for Allah with
devotion.” (Quran 2:238)
Also, the Prophet said, “Pray standing; if you are not
able to; pray sitting, if you are not able to; pray (while lying) on your side.”
[3]
4. Bowing
This is based on the Prophet’s saying to the person who
prayed incorrectly,  “then be at ease until you are at ease in bowing.”
[4]
And remaining in that position until you attain
""calmness.""
Speaking about the importance of this matter, he said, “The
worst people are the thieves who steal part of the prayer.”  He was asked how
this was done, and he replied, “He does not complete his bowings and
prostrations,” or he said, “He does not straighten his back during his bowings
and prostrations.”
[5]
“The prayer of one who does not straighten his back in
his bowings and prostrations is not accomplished.”
[6]
5. Rising up from bowing
This is based on the
hadith
, “then rise till you
are standing straight.” (Bukhari, Muslim)
6. Prostration
This is based on the
hadith
, “then prostrate till
you are at ease in prostration.”
7. Sitting between the two prostrations
This is based on the
hadith
, “then rise up till
you are at ease sitting.”
8. Attaining calmness
A person prayed too fast without attaining calmness. The
Prophet disapproved his speed and said, “you did not pray.”
Attaining calmness means that each body part assumes the
appropriate position before one moves from one position to another.
9. Reciting the final
tashahhud
This will be done in the final sitting of the prayer. The
words of the
tashahhud
were taught by Prophet himself.  Ibn Mas’ud said,
a companion of the Prophet, said, “Before it was made obligatory to say the
tashahhud
,
we used to say, ‘Peace be upon Allah, and peace be upon Gabriel and Michael.’
Then the Messenger of Allah said, ‘Do not say that but say, ‘All compliments
are for Allah…’”
[7]
.
10.   Sitting to recite the final
tashahhud
This will be the final sitting of the prayer.
11. Sending blessings on the Prophet after the final
tashahhud
This is to be done after reciting the final
tashahhud
.
12. Saying ‘
As-Salamu
’
Alaikum
wa-Rahmatullah
’ to conclude the prayer
In an obligatory prayer it has to be said twice, however
in the funeral prayer it is sufficient to say it once.
13. Order
All the “essential components” of salah need to be
performed in the correct order.
Acts That Invalidate the Prayer
There are certain acts that if done, would invalidate
the prayer. What that means is that a person has to start over the prayer from
the beginning.
1. Being certain that you broke the
wudoo
A man complained to the Messenger of Allah about feeling
something  (in his abdomen) in the prayer. The Prophet said, “Do not turn away
(from
salah
) unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.”
[8]
This does not mean you only turn away from
salah
when you hear a sound or notice a smell. As long as you are
sure
you
broke wind and passed gas, your
wudoo
is broken and  you must make it
again and start the prayer from the beginning.
2. Intentionally not performing a
rukn
or prerequisite
of prayer without a valid excuse
This is based on the Prophet saying to the man who did
not pray properly, “Go back and pray for you h"

Etiquette of Calling the
Adhan
(1)  It is recommended for the man calling the
adhan
should be clean from major or minor impurities.
(2)  The
adhan
is given standing and facing the
qiblah
(the direction of the
Kabah
).
(3)      The caller turns with
his head to the right upon saying “Hayya ‘alas-salah” and to the left upon saying
“
Hayya ‘alal-falah
.”
(5)  The index finger is put in the ears.
(6)  The voice is to be raised, even if a man is
alone.  Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, one of the Prophet’s companions, said to one of
his students, “I see that you love the sheep and the desert.  If you are with
your sheep or in the desert, then raise your voice while making the call to
prayer, for any jinn, human or thing within hearing distance of your voice will
be a witness for you on the Day of Resurrection...I heard the Messenger of
Allah say that.”
[4]
(8)  It is better not to speak to a man while he is
calling the
adhan
or
iqamah
.

Collection, London, by Jean-Leon Gerome (1824-1904) a French painter.
Women &
Adhan
Can a woman call the
adhan
around men, or among a
group of Muslim women, or if she is by herself? By the agreement of Muslim
scholars, a Muslim woman is forbidden to call the
adhan
in the company
of men.  Allah has not charged her with calling the worshippers to the mosque. 
However, if she is in a group of Muslim women or by herself, she may call the
adhan
and
iqamah
in a low voice.
Responding to the
Adhan
It is preferred for one who
is reciting the Quran, engaged in
dhikr
(Allah’s remembrance), or
studying, that he stop what he is doing and repeat the
adhan
after the
caller to prayer.  After it is over, one may resume.  A person repeats each
phrase after the

front of him while praying.
7.    A person must not rush to catch up prayer
that is in progress at entering the
masjid
, because the Prophet forbade
rushing in such a situation. Prophet Muhammad said:
“If the prayer started, then do not join it
running, but join it walking and do it calmly, and pray whatever you caught up
with, and make up for what you missed.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
If a Muslim arrives late to a prayer, he should say “
Allahu
Akbar
” and join the congregation. If a
rakah
was joined after
ruku’
,
then the entire
rakah
needs to be repeated after the prayer. So when the
imam finishes with the prayer then you should stand up and make-up what you
missed.
It is appropriate to join the back row and fill in all
the spaces. If there is no more room, then a new row should start directly
behind the imam, and more latecomers fill out to the right and to the left.
Sisters should begin a new row in front if the row starts in the back.
8.    One should keep quiet during the prayer. During
the congregational prayer, there is no good reason for making a lot of noise
while people are trying to pray, yet conversations can sometimes be heard
during the prayer! Children should be trained to stay near their parent in prayer
if possible, or if not, they should not be brought to the
masjid
to pray.
9.    The Muslim should not distract others praying
in the
masjid
, because a person in prayer is in contact with Allah.
Causing distraction is quite a serious matter - people should not be disturbed
by actions such as reciting the Quran loudly.
10.  The one who enters the
masjid
should
not sit until he prays two
rakahs
. You pray them the same way you pray
the two
rakahs
of the obligatory
Fajr
prayer. The reason you pray
them is to show respect to the
masjid
before sitting down. The Prophet
said:
“When one of you enters the
masjid
, he
should pray two
rakah
before sitting down.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh
Muslim
)
11.   If
an individual is praying outside of the congregation (optional prayers, or obligatory
prayers alone), he should place something in front of him during prayer as a
barrier between himself and the passersby in front of him. It can be a chair, a
wall, or a pillar. He should also come a little close to it as the Prophet used
to do. Prophet Muhammad said:
“If you pray, then pray toward a
sutrah
(barrier) and get close to it.” (
Abu Daud
)
It is not necessary to have a barrier in front of a
person if praying in congregation, except for the
imam
, whose barrier
acts for the congregation.
12.  Muslims are not supposed to walk in front of a
person praying. If a person is praying with a
sutrah
(barrier), let’s
say behind a chair, then you cannot walk between the person and the chair, but
beyond the chair. Prophet Muhammad said: “If one knew (the sin) of passing in
front of one who is praying, he would rather wait for forty than to pass in
front of him.” Abu al-Nadr - one of the
hadith
narrators, said: “I do
not remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years.” (Bukhari,
Muslim)
13.  The Muslim should sit where he finds a place
in the
masjid
. The Muslim should not jump over people or squeeze himself
between two people who are already sitting so as not to bother or harm them. Many
ahadith
of the Prophet convey this meaning.
14.   Instead of chatting and gossiping, it is
better for a Muslim to keep himself busy supplicating and remembering Allah,
because he is considered as if in the prayer as long as he is waiting for the
prayer.
15.  The Muslim should keep the
masjid
clean
and tidy, and fragrant because it is the house of Allah. The Prophet considered
spitting in the
masjid
to be a sin that could be forgiven only if the Muslim
cleans the area. The Prophet of Islam said:
“Spitting in the
masjid
is a sin and its
expiation is to clean it.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
The Companions of the Prophet used to keep the
masjid
clean, like the famous Companion, Ibn Umar, used to put perfume inside the
masjid
when Umar, his father, sat on the pulpit to deliver Friday sermon (Abu Daud). Traditional
incense or modern day sprays and electric devices can be used for the purpose.
16.  The Muslim should not walk out of the
masjid
after the
Adhan
has been given before he prays that prayer with other Muslims
in congregation. Let us say you have prayed
Dhuhr
earlier at home or
another
masjid
, then you go to "

Wajibaat
(Obligatory acts) of
Salah
They are those acts that have to be performed in the prayer.  If a
wajib
act is left
intentionally
, the prayer is invalidated.  However if it is
left
unintentionally
then one must perform the “prostration of
forgetfulness” to make up for it.  This will be covered in more detail in a
later lesson.
The following are the obligations of the prayer:
1.  Saying ‘
Allahu Akbar
’ when moving from one position
to another
The Prophet used to say
Allahu Akbar
every time
he went down or rose.
[1]
2.  Words while bowing (
ruku’
)
To say: ‘
Subha-na Rabbi al-
’
Adheem’
(Exalted and perfect is my Lord,
the Great) once.  To say beyond that is a recommended act.
3.  Words upon standing up from
ruku’
The Prophet said, “When he (the
imam
) says:
Sami
’
-Allahu li-man hamidah
(Allah hears the
one who praises him),
then you all say:
Rabba-na wa lakal-hamd
(To our Lord is all praise and thanks).“ (Agreed upon)
Both these are to be said when you are praying by
yourself.  However when you are praying behind an
imam
then you only say
‘
Rabba-na wa lakal-hamd
’
.
4.  Words while prostrating
To say: ‘
Subha-na
Rabbi al-A’la
’ (Exalted and perfect is my Lord, the All-High) once.  To say
beyond that is a recommended act.
5.  Supplication between two prostrations
To say ‘
Rabbig-fir lee
’ once.  To say beyond that
is a recommended act.
6.  First
Tashahhud
To recite the first
tashahhud.
This takes place
in the first “long sitting” of those prayers which are more than 2 units.
Once, the Prophet forgot the first
tashahhud
, but
he did not repeat the prayer, instead he made up for it with the “prostration
of forgetfulness.” This shows that this is a
wajib
act; if it were an “essential
component”, then the “prostration of forgetfulness” would not have been
sufficient.
7.  Sitting to recite the first
Tashahhud
To sit to recite the first
tashahhud
.
Recommended Acts of Prayer
The following are some of the recommended acts of
prayer:
1.  Opening Supplication
It is only to be said in the first
rakah
.
The most common prayer is the following:
“
Subhaana-kallaa-humma
wa biham-dika, wa tabaa-ra-kasmu-ka, wa ta’aa-laa jad-du-ka, wa laa ilaa-ha
ghay-ruk
.”
(You are Glorified, O
Allah, and Praised; Your Name is blessed; Your Majesty is Exalted, and none has
the right to worshipped but You).  (Abu Daud).
2.  Seeking Refuge in Allah
It is to be said in the first
rakah
by simply
saying,
“
Aa’oodhu billahi
min ash-Shaitan nir-rajim
”
‘I seek refuge with Allah, from the Devil, the Rejected
One.’
3.  Saying ‘
Ameen’
The word ‘
Ameen’
is not part of
Surah
al-Fatihah, but rather a supplication meaning, “O Allah, respond.”
It is to be said after reciting
Surah
al-Fatihah.
The Prophet said, “When the imam says
Ameen
, you
should say
Ameen
.  If this corresponds with when the angels say it, then
he will have all of his previous sins forgiven.”
[2]
4.  Reciting a portion of the Quran after reciting
Surah
al-Fatihah in the first two units
You can recite any portion of the Quran.  For example you
can recite short chapters such as
Surah
al-Ikhlas,
Surah
al-Falaq,
or
Surah
an-Naas.
5.  Supplicating after sending blessings on the Prophet in
the final sitting of the prayer
One can say:
“
Allaahumma innee
’
a’oothu bika min ’athaabil-qabr, wa min
’
athaabi jahannama, wa min fitnatil-mahyaa
wal-mamaati, wa min sharri fitna-til-masee-hid-dajjaal
.”
(O Allah!  I truly seek
refuge with You from the punishment of the grave, and from the punishment of
the Hellfire, and from the trials of living (meaning the trials of this life
and temptations a person faces) and dying (it means either the trial at the
time of death or the punishment of the grave), and from the evil [trials] of
the Anti-Christ.).
[3]
6.  Raising one’s hands
To raise one’s hands when saying the opening
takbir
,
when bowing, and rising from the bowing and when standing from the first “long
sitting” (where one recites the first
tashahhud
).
7.  Putting the right hand over the left upon the chest
To put the right hand over the left upon the chest.

The ritual prayer (
salah
[1]
)
is the heartbeat of Islamic worship, a living expression of Islam.  It keeps a
Muslim in permanent contact with Allah.  The recitation of the Quran, the
sacred scripture of Islam, is an inseparable element of the prayer.  In it, one
finds the purest expression of the essential elements of Islam.  Being a ritual
act of devotion to Allah, it has two faces: the legal prescription and the
spiritual dimension.  We shall discuss the latter in this lesson.
The first duty on a person upon becoming Muslim
is the performance of the prayers. The prayers are obligatory on every Muslim
man and woman five times a day throughout their life once they declare Islam.  The
prayer (
salah
) is the second pillar of Islam, after the two Testimonies. 
Whether one is rich or poor, healthy or sick, traveling or resident, a Muslim
must pray.
[2]
Every
Muslim should learn the rules and regulations of praying correctly and pray
five times a day.  Learning and performing the prayer should be the first
priority of every new Muslim.  If you are new to Islam, incorporating a new
religious practice done in an unfamiliar language may feel strange and intimidating,
but soon with patience and Allah’s help it will become part of your life.  Prayer
to a Muslim is as important as breathing, and  it isn’t as difficult as it may
seem!
The prayer revolves around three supreme
realities in a Muslim’s life: Allah, His Prophet, and the community of
believers.  Allah is constantly praised, glorified, thanked, and remembered in prayer
(
salah
).  A Muslim turns himself inwardly and outwardly to Allah.  The
method of the prayer is that of the Prophet in which he is mentioned as well.  Lastly,
the prayer ties one to the community of the faithful, especially when performed
in the mosque with a local congregation.
The prayer (
salah
) is considered the most
important act of worship prescribed for human beings.  It is the backbone of
religious observance of a Muslim. Without a spine, the human body would
collapse. Similarly, without the prayer a person’s Islamic practice would fall
apart. The Prophet himself compared it to the spine:
“The head of all affairs is Islam, its
spine is the prayer (
salah
)…”
(Al-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)
Emphasizing its importance, the Prophet said:
“Between a person and disbelief is discarding
the prayer (
salah
).”
[3]
What this means is that if a man stops to pray
completely, he slides into disbelief.
There are quite a few other points which emphasize
the importance of the prayer (
salah
), from them the following:
- The Prophet at his death bed advised the
Muslims to pay attention to
salah
.
[4]
- It was the first act of worship made
compulsory on Muslims who were required to observe the prayer while in Mecca
before migration to Medina.  Compulsory charity (
Zakat
[5]
),
fasting, and pilgrimage were made compulsory in Medina.
- The first matter we will be questioned about
on the Day of Judgment is
salah
:
“The first matter which a slave will be
held to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer (
salah
).  If it
is good, all the rest of his deeds become good, but if it is bad, all the rest
of his deeds become bad.”
[6]
- Abraham asked his Lord to give him descendants
who would abide by their prayers:
“My Lord! Cause me and (some) of my offspring to
remain constant in prayer.  And O our Lord!  Accept my supplication” (Quran 14:40)
The Quran is full of commands to pray to
emphasize its importance.  The prayer has been divinely transmitted to us in
two ways.  First, Allah Himself commanded Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, when he ascended into the heavens in a journey
known as the
Mi’raaj
(The Ascension).  The commandment for the prayer (
salah
)
was not brought down by an angel to the Prophet, but the Prophet was taken up
to the heavens, and Allah addressed him directly in its obligation.  Second,
the great angel Gabriel descended to teach the Prophet the five prayers and
their times.

·To understand how the Friday prayer is
conducted and who is required to pray.
·To appreciate the wisdom behind the Friday prayer.
·To learn the virtues of the Friday prayer.
Arabic Terms:
·
Salat ul-Jumuah
- Friday prayer.
·
Dhuhr
- the afternoon prayer.
·
Khutbah
- sermon.
·
Khatib
- person delivering the sermon.

·

- an Islamic way of calling Muslims

On Fridays, the
Dhuhr
(afternoon
prayer) is replaced with a what is known as
Salat ul-Jumuah
.
Salat
ul-Jumuah
consists of a short sermon and a congregational prayer. The Friday
prayer
cannot
be done at home or prayed individually. That is why
Muslims gather in a central mosque to pray and listen to a sermon, known as
khutbah
in Arabic. It is common for a designated
Imam
(prayer leader) to give
the
khutbah
, but sometimes this is done by invited guests or general members
of a community.
In the West, sermons are mostly delivered
in English, however sometimes they are only in Arabic. In any case, at least
part of the sermon is always in Arabic. The sermon is made of two parts. After
the first part is over, the
khatib
(person delivering the
khutbah
)
takes a short break and sits, and then resumes it. The quality of a sermon
greatly differs depending on the speaker who might be a knowledgeable scholar
of Islam or a lay person. The speaker will praise Allah and then discuss issues
relevant to the Muslim community. Afterwards, the
Imam
will lead the
congregation in a short prayer of two
rakahs
.
Salat ul-Jumuah
(the
sermon and the prayer), usually lasts for an hour or less.
Men Must Pray
Salat ul-Jumuah
The Friday prayer is compulsory and
required from all Muslim
men
. This is based on the Quran in which Allah
says,
“O you who believe, when the call to prayer (
Adhan
)
is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and
leave trade aside. That is better for you, if you did but know.” (Quran 62:9)
Prophet Muhammad has stated very
clearly who is required to pray
Salat ul-Jumuah
and who is exempt:
“The Friday prayer in congregation
is an obligatory duty on every Muslim except four: a slave, a woman, a child,
and a sick person.”
[1]
To be precise, Friday prayer is
required from every Muslim male who has reached puberty. Others can attend it,
but are not sinful if they don’t.
Additionally, Prophet Muhammad has
given a stern warning against missing the Friday prayers. He said,
“People should stop missing Friday
prayers otherwise Allah will put a seal on their hearts and thus they will be
among the heedless.”
[2]
A Muslim man who is sick or travelling
may miss the Friday prayer. A Muslim woman is not required to pray the Friday
prayer, but she is allowed to attend the prayers if she wants to. Most mosques have
separate seating arrangements for women, but some may lack women’s area for
praying the Friday prayer. Also, the women who decide not to attend the
Salat
ul-Jumuah
should offer the regular
Dhuhr
prayer at home.
Wisdom Behind Friday Prayer
1.    The Friday prayer brings
local Muslims together in one place on a fixed day, thereby increasing the
bonds of brotherhood between Muslims.
2.    The purpose of the
khutbah
(sermon) is to educate the Muslims and serves as a weekly reminder about their duties
to Allah and fellow human beings. It warns against sin and disobeying Allah,
and encourages to be good and to obey Allah.
3.    The topics are varied and
often update the Muslims on current affairs and as Muslim what should be their
role.
Virtues of Friday
Friday is a virtuous day with many
special qualities.
1.    Prophet Muhammad said:
“When it is a Friday, the angels
stand at the gate of the mosque and keep on writing the names of the persons
coming to the mosque in succession according to their arrivals. The example of
the one who enters the mosque in the earliest hour is that of one offering a
camel (in sacrifice). The one coming next is like one offering a cow and then a
ram and then a chicken and then an egg respectively. When the Imam comes out
(for the Friday prayer) they (i.e. angels) fold their papers and listen to the
Khutbah
.”
[3]
This narration shows the reward of
coming early to the Friday prayer. The earlier a person arrives, the greater
his reward. The first arrival attains the reward of sacrificing a camel for
Allah, but those who arrive later receive lesser rewards.
2.    He also said:
“The best day on which the sun has
ever risen is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted into
Paradise, and on it he was expelled from it, and the Hour will not be
established except on Friday.”
[4]
The purpose of this narration is to tell
us of the magnificent events that took place on Friday or will take place.

Objectives
·To understand the virtues of ablution (
wudoo
).
·In the firstlesson, we discussed the
basics of ablution (
wudoo
). In this lesson, we will describe how to
perform ablution in a little more detail, and mention the
ahadith
from
which this method is derived.
Arabic Terms
·
Nafl
- a voluntary act of worship
·
Hadith
- (plural –
ahadith
) is
a piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
·
Wudoo
– ablution.
The Virtues of Ablution
By the ultimate grace of Allah,
He commands us with certain obligations, and then also rewards us for their
fulfillment. Performing ablution as well has many virtues associated with it,
from forgiveness of sins to it being a mark of recognition on the Day of Judgment.
The following are an example of some of the
ahadith
which mention these
rewards.
(1)  Messenger of Allah,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“When a Muslim or a
believer performs ablution and washes his face, every lesser sin that he
committed as a result of looking washes away with water (or with the last drop
of water). When he washes his hands, every sin that his hands committed washes
away with water (or with the last drop of water). When he washes his feet,
every sin to which he proceeded washes away with water (or with the last drop
of water) until he emerges pure and sin free..” (
Muslim
)
(2)  Messenger of Allah said:
“Shall I inform you (of an
act) by which Allah erases sins and raises degrees?  They (his Companions) said,
‘Certainly, O Messenger of Allah.’  He said, ‘Perfecting the ablution under
difficult circumstances, taking many steps to the mosque, and waiting for the
(next) prayer after the (last) prayer has been performed.  That is
ribat
[1]
.’” (
Saheeh
Muslim
)
(3)  Messenger of Allah
passed by a grave site and said:
“Peace be upon you, the
abode of the believing people, and soon we as well, if Allah so wills, are
about to join you. I love to see my brothers.”
They (his Companions)
said: “Aren’t we your brothers, O Messenger of Allah?”
He said: “You are my
Companions; our brothers are those who have not yet come into the world.”
They said: “O Messenger of
Allah, how would you recognize those persons of your nation [on the Day of
Judgment] who have not yet been born?”
He replied: “Suppose a man
had horses with white blazes on their foreheads and legs among other horses
which were all black. Tell me, would he not recognize his own horses?”
They said: “Certainly, O
Messenger of Allah.”
He said: “They [those who
have not come yet] will come with white faces, arms and legs owing to ablution,
and I will arrive at the Cistern
[2]
before them. Some people will be driven away from my Cistern as a
stray camel is driven away. I will call out: ‘Come, come.’ Then it will be said
(to me): ‘These people changed [the religion by innovating in it] after you,’
and I will say: ‘Be off, be off.’” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
On the Day of Judgment, the
Muslim nation will be distinguished from other nations by the body parts which
they washed for ablution which will be emanating with light:
“My people will be called
to presence on the Day of Judgment with bright faces, arms and legs from the
traces of ablution.” (
al-Bukhari
)
The Method of Performing Ablution
Allah, the Exalted, says
in the Quran:
“O you who believe! When
you intend to offer the prayer, wash your faces and from your hands up to the
elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet up to the ankles.” (Quran 5:6)
Prophet Muhammad also said:
“Allah does not accept any
prayer performed without being in a state of purity.”
(Muslim)
The Prophet practically taught
us how to perform ablution, as he was sent to explain the revelation of the
Quran. The following is a step by step guide explaining what exactly is to be
washed and how, gathered from various texts of
hadith
.
(1)  You must have the
intention of purifying yourself from a state of ritual impurity
[3]
.  This means that you
should bring into your mind that you are performing this
wudoo
in order
to enter a state of ritual purity. This intention is in the heart and is
not
to be
uttered.
(2)  Begin with the name
of Allah, by saying ‘
Bismillaah
’.
(3)  Then, wash your hands
three times each. You should always start with the right whenever washing the
body parts..
(4)  Rinse your mouth
three times, swirling the water around inside your mouth (gargling), and then rinse
your nose three times by inhaling some water into your nostrils and blowing the
water out. Use your left hand to remove the water from your nose.
(5)  Wash your face three
times, from the hairline to the jawbone and chin, and from ear to ear.  A man
should wet the hair of his beard because it is part of the face.  If his beard
is thin he has to wash it inside and out, and if it is thick and covers the
skin, it is sufficient to wash the surface and run his wet fingers through it.

It is better to perform
ghusl
on Friday
before
Salat ul-Jumuah
.
[1]
The
time extends between Friday dawn and the time of the Friday prayer.  Although it
may not be possible for many to perform
ghusl
right before the prayerdue to work or school, they can do so before they leave in the morning. If
one breaks his
wudoo
after performing
ghusl
, it is sufficient to
make new
wudoo
without bathing again.
(2)      For the Bi-Annual Eid prayers.
A Muslim is encouraged to perform
ghusl
for
Eid
prayers.  Many reports from the Companions have been reported regarding
this matter.
(3)      On entering Mecca.
It is preferable for whoever wants to enter Mecca to perform
ghusl
.
[2]
(4)
Ghusl
after washing a corpse.
Performing
ghusl
is preferred for one who
has washed a corpse.
[3]
Ghusl
for Women
A woman bathes as outlined above, except that if
she has braided hair she does not have to undo it, provided the water can reach
the roots of her hair.
[4]
It
is sufficient for her to pour water over her head three times, making sure that
the water completely reaches the roots of her hair.
Also, nail polish or any other agent which prevents
water from reaching the body parts must be removed at the time of
ghusl
.
[5]
It is preferable for a woman, after performing
ghusl
due to menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding, to take some cotton smeared
with fragrance and wipe her private parts, in order to cleanse herself from the
odor of the menstrual blood.
[6]
Ghusl
is not required in the following
two cases:
(i)   Normal vaginal discharge.  It is
normal for a vagina to be naturally moist with a kind of mucus.  It changes
throughout the monthly cycle in response to the body’s hormone production.  Most
normal young and older women have a white, sticky discharge called leucorrhea,
a liquid quite distinct from orgasmic fluid.  It’s normal for women to get a
little discharge on their clothing.  The secretions can be more inclined to
wetness or dryness, and be more or less thick or viscous.  These secretions may
turn white or yellow when exposed to the air.  Normal vaginal fluids can have a
mild scent, or no aroma at all, and can be clear or milky white when moist,
yellowish in color when dried, and mucus-like or stringy in consistency.  They
can be heavier during mid-cycle, when ovulation occurs, during pregnancy, and
when using birth control pills.
Ghusl
is not required in such cases.
(ii)  Foreplay, thinking about intercourse
and sexual arousal causes veins to dilate.  This swelling creates a “sweating
reaction,” producing a fluid that lubricates the vagina and wets the entrance. 
The combination of vaginal mucus and lubrication makes up women’s sexual
secretions.  It can be white and thin and is
not
followed by feeling of
exhaustion.  This fluid is called
madhiy
in Arabic.
Ghusl
is not
required in this case as well.
A woman is considered sexually impure and must
perform
ghusl
in two cases:
(a)  Insertion of the penis in the vagina,
even if there is no ejaculation, renders both husband and wife sexually impure. 
Both require
ghusl
to resume worship.
(b)  Emission of the vaginal fluid called
maniy
due to wet-dream
[7]
and
female orgasm.
A woman has to do
ghusl
if she
experiences an erotic dream and notices
moisture
when she wakes up.
Also,
ghusl
becomes obligatory when
maniy
is produced after female orgasm due to any other reason for that matter.  Orgasm
is the climax of sexual activity accompanied by vaginal contractions and other
changes in the body, and commonly results from sexual intercourse.
[8]
Certain indicators like smell and color
distinguish
maniy
from normal vaginal discharge.  Women’s
maniy
,
the fluid which requires
ghusl
, is known by several qualities:
(a)  it is released as a result of feeling
sexual pleasure and a woman feels excitement when it is produced.
(b)  it is followed by a feeling of
exhaustion.
(c)  it has a particular odor.
[9]
(d)  it is usually yellow and non-viscous. It
can be white.
The first two qualities are perhaps the most
important indicators. Vaginal discharges described above that do
not
meet

the most important weekly prayer for Muslims.",Level 5 - Type:  Written Lesson - By  Imam Mufti (© 2012 NewMuslims.com),Published on 08 Oct 2012 - Last modified on 25 Jun 2019,Printed: 525 - Emailed: 0 - Viewed: 33156 (daily average: ),Acts of Worship > Prayers,https://www.newmuslims.com/category/147/prayers,,,"Objective:
·To learn ten etiquettes and duties on
Friday.
Arabic Terms:
·Salat
ul-Jumuah
- Friday Prayer.
·
Dhuhr
- the afternoon prayer.
·
Khutbah
- sermon.
·
Rakah
- unit of prayer.
·
Imam
- someone who leads the prayer.
·
Adhan
- an Islamic way of calling Muslims to the five
obligatory prayers.
Etiquette and Duties on Friday
1.       Wear Clean Clothes & Smell Good
Prophet Muhammad said,
“Every Muslim should have a ritual bath on Friday and wear his best clothing,
and if he has perfume, he should use it”
[1]
2.       Send Blessings on the Prophet
It is highly recommended to send peace and blessings on
Prophet Muhammad on Fridays as the Prophet said,
“Invoke blessings on me,
many times over, on Friday and the night (preceding it); for whoever does so, I
will be a witness and intercessor for him on the Day of Judgment.”
[2]
This is done by simply saying and repeating the words,
“
Allahumma
sal-ly wa sal-lim ‘Ala Muhammad
.”
Repeating these simple words anytime
during Friday brings great blessings as mentioned in the above report form
Prophet Muhammad.
3.       Increase Supplication
A Muslim should increase his supplication to Allah on
Friday because there is a time on Friday when Allah responds and gives whatever
good He is asked for. The Prophet said,
“There is an hour on Friday in which
no Muslim asks during it except that Allah grants him whatever he asks for.”
[3]
One can supplicate in any language he wants. The
etiquettes of supplication have been covered in previous lessons.
4.       Arrive Early at the Mosque
Prophet Muhammad said,
“Whoever takes a bath on
Friday like the one taken to purify oneself from sexual impurity, then he
leaves at the earliest time, then he is like the one who offers a camel; the
one who comes after that is like one who offers a cow; the one who comes after
that is like one who offers a horned ram; the one who comes after that is like
one who offers a chicken; the one who comes after that is like one who offers
an egg. When the
Imam
arrives, the angels are present to listen to the
remembrance (meaning the
khutbah
).”
[4]
If a person comes late, he should not step over people
already sitting in rows, nor separate two people sitting together. He should
also not move another person and take their place. A Muslim should not walk
directly in front of a person praying.
5.       Sit Close to the
Imam
A person must try to arrive early and sit close to the
Imam
delivering the sermon. Sitting closer to the
Imam
is better than sitting
behind in the back rows or reclining next to a wall. If a new Muslim finds it
hard to sit on the floor for half an hour or so, he may sit where ever he feels
comfortable, but he should try to get accustomed to sitting closer to the
Imam
.
6.       Don’t Talk During the
Khutbah
Also, a Muslim should pay attention to the sermon and
not talk during it, even if it is delivered in Arabic. Talking during the
Friday prayer is a serious matter. Prophet Muhammad said,
“If you say to
your friend, ‘Be quiet,’ on Friday when the
Imam
is delivering the
sermon, then you have uttered non-sense.”
[5]
In another narration, the Prophet said,
“…whoever
utters nonsense is considered as if he has not attended the Friday prayer!”
[6]
7.       Pray Two
Rakahs
For Entering the Mosque
Before Sitting Down
If you arrive to the mosque early, you should pray two
rakahs
before sitting down. If you arrive while the
Imam
is delivering the
sermon, you should still pray them, but make it short. The Prophet said,
“If
anyone of you enters the mosque on Friday while the
Imam
is delivering
the
khutbah
, let him perform two
rakahs
and be brief in doing
so.”
[7]
8.       Don’t Buy or Sell Once the
Adhan
Has Been
Called
This prohibition is based on the Quran itself,
“... when the
Adhan
is proclaimed for the prayer on
Friday, hasten to the remembrance of Allah and leave trading aside...” (Quran 62:9)
9.    The Friday prayer which consists of two
rakahs
is performed after the sermon behind an
Imam
. Someone who misses it
should pray four
rakahs
of regular
Dhuhr
prayer.
10.  You can pray two or four
rakahs
of
Sunnah
(recommended) prayer after the Friday prayer.
Making Arrangements with the Employer for Time Off for
Salat
ul-Jumuah
Countless Muslims take time off from their businesses,
schools, and employers to attend the Friday prayer. Friday prayer is a
religious obligation and a new Muslim should make arrangements with their
school or employer to take time off for attending it. You can make up the lost
hours by working extra during the week or staying late on Friday.

fard
) prayer.
Which Direction Do I pray in?
A Muslim is required to face
the direction of the
Kabah
(the Sacred House of Allah in Mecca) for each
prayer
salah
.  The
Kabah
is the first house built to worship
humanity’s One, True Lord.  All Muslims throughout the world face it when they
pray, leaving the world behind them whilst submitting themselves to their
Sustainer.  This direction is called the
qiblah
and it is fairly easy to
figure it out.
Again, you have several options
to figure out the direction of prayer (
qiblah
).
(1)  Ask a fellow Muslim
which in which direction you need to pray.
(2)
http://www.islamicfinder.org/
will
tell you where the
Kabah
is located from where you are.
(3)  Some wrist watches
are available in the market that make finding the direction of prayer quite
easy, especially when one is in an unfamiliar place or traveling.  They can be
ordered online
[1]
.
Getting Ready for Prayer (
Salah
)
1.    The prayer is
obligatory on every adult, sane Muslim once the time for a certain prayer has
started.
2.    Minimum clothing
requirements must be met by both men and women for prayer.
A
Muslim man must wear clothing that at least covers him from navel to knee, and
make sure that his shoulders are covered.
A
Muslim woman must wear loose clothing that covers her whole body, including her
head (and ears) and feet. She need not cover her hands and face.
3.    A Muslim must be in
the state of purity, meaning the person:
·should perform
wudoo
(ablution)
if he has passed wind, urinated, defecated or woke up from sleep since the last
time he performed
wudoo
.
·should perform the
ghusl
(ritual bath) if he woke up from a wet-dream, ejaculated semen, had intercourse
and additionally, in case of a woman, she ended her monthly cycle or her
post-childbirth bleeding.
4.    He must make sure
there is no impurity on his clothes, body, or the spot he will pray.
5.    He should face the direction
of prayer (
qiblah
).
6.    Make intention to
perform the prayers in the heart.
7.    The formal prayer
(salah
) must be offered in Arabic, so please read the transliteration of
the Arabic text provided at the end of ‘Prayer for Beginners (part 2 of 2)’.
The translation is given just to help know what you are saying.

The Prayer
The Prophet has commanded us:

Saheeh
Al-Bukhari
)
The following is a simple procedure for
performing the formal prayer for beginners. You will learn more, later.
Also, you may find Muslims praying slightly
differently. There is no reason to worry. Do not focus on little details at
this moment. Learn the basics first as presented over here.

Fajr
prayer)
1.   Standing
straight
·Stand straight facing the

·Your forehead, nose, both hands, knees,
  and feet should be touching the ground while in prostration. If doing it for
  the first time, it may be slightly uncomfortable, depending on how flexible
  your body is!  You will get used to it pretty soon. Remember the person is
  closest to Allah in prostration.
·Repeat in a low voice three times:
Subhana rabbi-yal-a'laa
‘How Perfect is my Lord, the Most   High.’

Arabic Terms
·
Wudoo
– ablution.
·
Salah
- the Arabic word to denote a
direct connection between the believer and Allah.  More specifically, in Islam
it refers to the formal five daily prayers and is the most important form of
worship.
·
Ghusl
– ritual bath.
What is Ablution (
Wudoo
)?
Wudoo
, translated as ablution, is done before
certain acts of worship. It is basically washing of one's face, hands and arms,
then wiping the head and ears, and finally washing the feet.
When Should I Perform Ablution (
Wudoo
)?
A Muslim must perform ablution before he performs
the prayer (
salah
) if he enters a state of ritual impurity, namely due
to one of the following causes:
(1)  Breaking wind.
(2)  Urination.
(3)  Defecation (passing feces).
(4)  Deep sleep.
These things are considered to ‘invalidate’ or
‘break’ ablution (
wudoo
).  For example, you must perform ablution after waking
up in the morning to pray your morning prayer (
salah
), because sleeping
“breaks” the  ablution. After using the toilet, you have to perform  ablution before
you can perform prayer because urinating and defecating “break” the  ablution.
How to Perform Ablution?
Before you perform ablution, you should make
sure your body parts are not soiled with impurities. Make sure you have wiped
off all traces of urine or feces with toilet paper or water after having used
the toilet.
Ablution is done in the following order:
1.    Intend in your heart that you are
performing  ablution in order to enter a state of purity for
salah
.
2.    Begin with the name of Allah by
saying,
‘Bismillaah’
which means,
‘I begin with
the Name of Allah.’
3.    Rinse the mouth. This can be done
  once, twice or thrice. See Figure 1.
Figure 1
4.    Clean the nostrils by sniffing
  water and blowing it. This can be done once, twice or thrice. See Figure 2.
Figure 2
5.    Wash the face from the hairline to
  the chin and jawbone, from ear to ear. This can be done once, twice or
  thrice. See Figure 3.
Figure 3
6.    Wash the hands and arms up to and
  including the elbows. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the
  right hand.  See Figure 4.
Figure 4
7.    After wetting the hands again, wipe
  the entire head by putting the hands at the front of your head and take them
  to the back of the head, then bring them back to the place where you
  started.  This is to be done only once. See Figure 5.
Figure 5
8.    Wipe the inner part of the ears
  with the index fingers and the back of the ears with the thumbs. This is to
  be done only once. See Figure 6.
Figure 6
9.    Wash the feet up to and including
  the ankles. This can be done once, twice or thrice. Begin with the right
  foot. See Figure 7.
Figure 7
What is Ritual Bath (
Ghusl
)?
Ghusl
is the Arabic word for a complete
bath. In certain cases, it is not enough to perform ablution before prayers.  One
needs to purify themselves by taking a full bath, that is doing the ritual bath
(
ghusl
), before they may pray.  You are required to do the ritual bath
in the following cases:
1.
The emission of semen or female orgasmic
fluid, whether due to sexual intercourse, wet dreams or masturbation.
2.
After sexual intercourse.  More
precisely, a bath has to be taken if the penis enters the vagina, regardless of
whether fluid was emitted or not.
3.
Menstruation and post-natal bleeding
[1]
.
4.
It is also preferred to perform theritual
bath upon entering Islam.
A female cannot offer
salah
(prayer) when
she is experiencing menstruation or postpartum bleeding.  After her bleeding
ends, she must purify herself by taking the ritual bath, and then she may resume
salah
(prayer).
How to Perform the Ritual Bath
(1) Intend in your heart to purify yourself
for Allah’s sake.
(2) Wash off any impurity that may be on
the body.
(3) Wash the entire body with water leaving
no part dry.
(4) Rinse the mouth and nose.

Post-natal or post partum bleeding is that bleeding which occurs
after childbirth or miscarriage."

What is Prayer (
Salah
)?
·Prayer (
Salah
) is the formal
establishment of prayer required of a Muslim five times daily.  Prayer (
Salah
)
consists of specific statements and actions.
Getting Ready for Prayer (
Salah
)
The timings
:  The five daily prayers have
to be offered within a certain time range. They are
Fajr
,
Dhuhr
,
Asr
,
Magrib
and
Isha
, and you can find the prayer timings for your
city from this link:
http://www.islamicfinder.org/
The timings of the prayers vary from place to
place. And this is why you need to find the prayer timings for your specific
city.
The prayers do not need to be prayed exactly
when the time starts; rather, they can be prayed at any time before the next
prayer time starts, with the exception of
Fajr
and
Isha.
The
Fajr
prayer should be prayed before sunrise. For this reason, you will find the
time for sunrise listed on Prayer schedules, and this does not mean that there
is a special prayer for Sunrise.  And the
Isha
prayer should be prayed
till the middle of the night. However, due to necessity, the
Isha
prayer
can be prayed up to the beginning of
Fajr
time.
The direction
: You can use the same
website to find the direction of prayers. The website will display the bearing
on a compass after you have entered your city.
The dress
: A Muslim man should wear
something that at least covers him from the navel to the knees. A Muslim woman
must wear loose clothing that covers her entire body and hair leaving her face
and palms open.
State of Purity
: One should be in a state
of purity, by performing ablution (
wudoo’
) or ritual bath (
ghusl
)
[this was covered in Part 1]. Also one should make sure that there is no
impurity (such as urine or faeces) on one’s clothes or body. The prayers can be
done on any clean surface such as the floor, carpet or a rug. Dust, mud or
grease are considered ok and do not affect the prayers.
The Prayer (
Salah
)
The Prayer(
salah
) is to be said
in Arabic and requires some memorization, so, it usually takes a little time to
learn correctly and fully and get used to it.  Not knowing Arabic should not discourage
you; just pray the prayer (
salah
) to the best of your ability.
A new Muslim has to realize that the orders of
Allah are to be followed within the limit of his or her ability and endurance. 
If you find it difficult to memorize all of what is necessary for the prayers,
it may be a good idea in the meantime to write it on a piece of paper and read
them in prayer.  If you are unable to do even this, it is sufficient that you
say any or all of the following instead:
·
Subhanallah
‘How Perfect is Allah!’
·
Al-hamdu lil-lah
‘All
praise and thanks are for Allah’
·
La ilaha il-lal-lah
‘There is no god except Allah’
·
Allahu Akbar
‘Allah
is the Greatest’
Here is an example of a
2 unit prayer (like the
Fajr
prayer), based on the last method of
prayers explained above.
1.  Stand
straight facing the direction of prayer.
2.  Raise
  your hands up to the shoulders and say

Introduction
What should you do in
the situation where you have to pray
salah
(ritual prayer), yet neither
have no water suitable for making
wudoo
, nor the time be able to find
such water soon enough to pray on time?
What if you are sick and either not able to make
wudoo,
or making
wudoo
is detrimental to your health.  What is the correct
procedure in such a case?
The answer to these common questions is to perform a “dry”
ablution, which is called
tayammum
.
Tayammum
consists of using clean
soil or dust to wipe your face and hands with the intention of preparing
oneself to pray, and, as such, substitutes
wudoo
in special
circumstances.
The procedure and basic conditions of making
tayammum
are mentioned in the Quran and
Sunnah
.  The Quran says:
“And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from
relieving himself, or you have touched women, and you do not find water, then
perform
tayammum
with clean earth.  Certainly, Allah is ever Pardoning
and Forgiving.” (Quran 4:43)
The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said:
“All of the earth has been made a clean place to pray for me
and my nation.  Whenever a person from my nation wants to pray, he has
something with which to purify himself, that is, the earth.”
[1]
Tayammum
is one of the five blessings from Allah
to Muslims that He did not give to any other prophet before Prophet Muhammad,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him.  The Prophet said:
“I have been given five things that were not given
to anyone before me: …the earth has been made a place of prayer for me - wherever
and whoever of my nation wants to pray, he may pray...”
[2]
Situations Where
Tayammum
Is Done
Tayammum
cannot be made at will or when one feels
wudoo
is inconvenient.  There are specific situations where it can be
made:
(1)  If you cannot find water or the water is not
enough for
wudoo
. Before making
tayammum
, you should try to get appropriate
water from any accessible place you can find it.  Only if you cannot find good water,
or it is too far away, can you make
tayammum
.
‘Imran bin Husain, one of the companions of Prophet
Muhammad said,
“We were with the Messenger of Allah during a journey.  When
he led the people in prayer, one man stayed apart.  He asked him, “What
prevented you from praying?”  He said, ‘I need a purifying bath and there is not
sufficient water.’  He said, ‘Use the soil, for it is sufficient.’’’
[3]
(2)  Injury or illness.
You may perform
tayammum
if you think using water
will worsen your disease based on past experience or the doctor’s advice. A
person hospitalized who is unable to make
wudoo
, may keep a bag with
some clean soil to make
tayammum
.
(3)  If the water is harmful to you because it is too
cold and for some reason you cannot heat it up.
‘Amr ibn al-’Aas narrated that he was participating in
an expedition.  He had a wet dream during an extremely cold night, and was
afraid that if he performed
ghusl
he would die.  He prayed the morning
prayer with his companions.  He then went to the Messenger of Allah to ask him
about this.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said,
“O ‘Amr, did you pray with your companions while you needed a purifying
bath?”
‘Amr mentioned the verse,
“Do not kill yourselves, Allah is
merciful to you”
to the Prophet.  The Prophet just smiled and didn’t say
anything.
[4]
(4)  If the water is nearby, but you cannot reach
it due to fear.
(5)  If you have water, but you need it for
cooking, or are saving it for use later.  For example, this may arise while
camping.  Many of the companions would save their drinking water and performed
tayammum
.
(6)  If you fear the time for
salah
(ritual
prayer) will be over by the time you get to water.
How to Perform
Tayammum
1.    You must have the intention of purifying yourself
and removing impurity.  The intention is in the heart and is not uttered.
2.    Say ‘
Bismillah
’ (I begin with the name
of Allah).
3.    Gently touch the ground or a dusty surface
with the palms of both hands.
4.    Blow on the hands and shake off any access,
so as not to make the face dusty.
5.    Wipe the palms together, then the face, and then
the palms and backs of the hands up to the wrists.
Ammar, Prophet’s companion, said, “We became sexually
impure and had no water, so we rolled in the dirt as does an animal and prayed.” 
This was mentioned to the Prophet and he said:
“This would"

Meaning
The Arabic word for prostration is ‘
sajdah
.’ It means to put
one’s head, hands, knees, and toes on the ground. The two
sajdahs
made
at the end of
salah
to make up for major errors are known as the
‘prostration of forgetfulness’ or
sajdah as-sahw
in Arabic.
Importance
We human beings are forgetful by nature and even forget
when we are praying to Allah. Our Creator is well aware of that fact and He
made His Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, forget on
some occasions in the prayer. This way the Prophet showed us how to correct our
mistakes in the prayer. Making up for our mistakes in prayer is a great mercy
from Allah because He could have made us repeat the prayer for every mistake,
but He did not.
When Are Prostrations of Forgetfulness Required?
They are two occasions when they
are required:
I.When
you add or subtract to the acts of
salah
.
Examples of addition:
You pray 5
rakahs
instead of 4.
You do three
prostrations instead of two.
You make
tashahhud
at the end of first
rakah.
Example of subtraction:
You pray 3
rakahs
instead of 4.
You do one
sajdah
instead of two.
You get up for the third
rakah
without doing the first
tashahhud.
II.When
you forget the number of
rakahs
and are in doubt, (for example) whether
you prayed three of four
rakahs
.
Missing a
Rukn
(Essential Component or Pillar of
Salah
)
If you omit the
Takbiratul-Ihram
, then there is
no prayer for you, regardless of whether you left it intentionally or due to
forgetfulness, because you never started the prayer.
If you omit a
rukn
other than the
Takbiratul-Ihram
deliberately, your
salah
is invalid.
If you left a
rukn
out of forgetfulness and you
reached the next
rakah
, then the
rakah
in which you left the
rukn
is invalid and the following
rakah
takes its place.
If you did not reach the next
rakah
, you must
return to the
rukn
you omitted and perform it and follow it by what
comes after it in the course of the
salah
.
In both of the above situations, you offer the “prostration
of forgetfulness”.
Missing a
Wajib
(Obligatory act of
salah
)
If you leave out something
wajib
unintentionally,
like the first
tashahhud
or a prostration, you simply do
sajdah
as-sahw
at the conclusion of prayer.  However, it is left intentionally,
then the prayer is invalid.
Missing a Recommended Act in Prayer
You do not have to make the “prostration of
forgetfulness” if you forget to perform one of the recommended acts of prayer.
Method of
Sajdah as-sahw
You have a choice between two
ways of doing it:
1.    Immediately
before
tasleem
at
the end of
salah.
Before concluding the prayer with
tasleem
, you
say
Allahu Akbar
, and then make the first prostration.
In the prostration you say,
Subha-na Rabbi al-A
'la
three times. Then you say
Allahu Akbar
and return to the sitting
position.
Then you say
Allahu Akbar
again and make the
second prostration and say the same words as you did in the first prostration.
You then say
Allahu Akbar
for the last time,
return to the sitting position, and turn your head to the right and then to the
left, saying each time “
As-Salamu
'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah
.”
2.    Doing it
after
tasleem.
Another way is to continue your
salah
and end it
with
tasleem
as you normally would.
After that you say
Allahu Akbar
and prostrate for
your first prostration, and say
Subha-na Rabbi al-A
'la
three
times. Then you say
Allahu Akbar
and return to the sitting position.
Then you say
Allahu Akbar
again and do your
second prostration and say
Subha-na Rabbi al-A
'la
three times.
Finally, you say
Allahu Akbar
the last time and
return to the sitting position, and then turn your face to the right saying “
As-Salamu
'Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah
.”
Further Notes/Examples
1.    If you realize before making
tasleem
that you have added anything to the
salah
, for example an extra
rakah
,
you may do
sajdah as-sahw
before or after
tasleem
.

,

Something as mundane as
relieving oneself is tied to a Muslim’s sense of cleanliness and modesty.  There
is nothing odd or strange about it, as Islam literally is all encompassing,
something that evokes a pleasant surprise in some people.  Even in the time of
the Prophet, there was a polytheist who exclaimed with astonishment to Salman,
the Persian, “Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to
defecate
!”
 Salman responded, ‘“Yes, he forbade us to face the direction of Mecca
when urinating or defecating…”
[1]
In this lesson we will detail the
manners of relieving oneself, something apparently minor, but implies much about
personal hygiene and religious observance.
(A)   Supplications before Relieving
Oneself
There are certain supplications
one should recite when entering or leaving the place one relieves oneself,
whether it be in a bathroom or in nature.
(a)  One should say “
Bismillah
”
(I begin with the Name of Allah) before entering, because the Messenger of
Allah said:
“The eyes of the
jinn
are blocked from seeing the nakedness of the sons of Adam when one of them says
before entering the place for relieving oneself, ‘
Bismillah
.’” (
Al-Tirmidhi
)
(b)
Allah-humma
innee a’oodhu bika min al-khubuthi wa’l-kha-baa’ith
.
“O Allah, I seek refuge
with You from male and female devils.” (
Abu Daud
,
Al-Tirmidhi
)
Enter with your left foot.
(B)   Inside the Toilet
Facing the
Qibla
Out of respect a Muslim should
not face the
qiblah
[2]
when urinating or defecating.  The Messenger of Allah said:
“When any one of you sits
down to answer the call of nature, he should not face the
qiblah
or turn
his back towards it.” (
Saheeh Muslim
)
Concealment
We must conceal ourselves from
the sight of others when answering the call of nature.  The Messenger of Allah
preferred to go behind a rise on the ground or a garden of date palms.
[3]
If a person is in the
open and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call
of nature, he should move away from public sight.  One of the Companions
described how he was with the Prophet on a journey, and when the Prophet felt
the need to answer the call of nature, he went far away.
[4]
When outdoors, one should not
uncover their private parts until they squat close to the ground, as it is more
concealing.
[5]
Indoors, first make sure you have closed the door and are out of sight.
(C)   Relieving Oneself
Squatting
Outdoors, it is best to answer
the call of nature sitting.  It is better to adopt a posture that is more
concealing, one which will cause no splash-back on yourself or your clothes.  If
there is a need and a person does not fear splash-back, it is permissible to
urinate standing up.
Splash-Back
One must take great care to avoid
the splash-back of urine, both on themselves and their clothes.  If urine or
stool soils some part of body or clothes, those areas must also be washed, and
the impurity must be totally removed from them.  The Messenger of Allah passed
by two graves, and said:
“Indeed they are being
punished, but for something which seemed trivial to them: this one used not to
guard himself from urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious
gossip.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Prohibited Places
Islam forbids urinating in
places where people might pass by, or seek shade therein, such a park, because it
is something disturbing to people.  The Prophet said, “
Fear the two things
that bring curses
.”  They asked, “What are the two things that bring
curses, O Messenger of Allah?”
He said:
“When a person relieves
himself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade.” (
Abu
Daud
)
Also, it is forbidden to urinate
in stagnant water, as it was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah.
[6]
It obviously makes the
water impure and will disturb those who use it.
Conversation
Don’t say, ‘
As-Salamu Alaikum’
to a person who is answering the call of nature, or reply with ‘
Wa Alaikum Assalam
’
while relieving yourself, out of respect for God’s name.
Al-Salaam
is one
of Allah’s beautiful Names.
A man passed by the Prophet while
he was urinating, and greeted him with
Salam
.  The Messenger of Allah
said to him:
“If you see me in this
state, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond.” (
Ibn Majah
)
It is disliked to speak while
relieving oneself unnecessarily.
Urinals
Urinals should be avoided for
four reasons.  First, there is no privacy.  Private parts are exposed, which is
indecent and forbidden.  Second, it is almost impossible to avoid splash-back. 
Third, there is no toilet paper. Fourth, people sometimes talk while urinating,
an activity better left outside the toilet!

What is
Khushoo
?
At one time or another you might hear someone say that they wish
they had more
khushoo
in their prayer.
Khushoo
can be translated
as humility and devotion in prayer.  It is the state of mind that allows you to
transcend the everyday worries that flitter in and out of your mind disrupting
your focus in prayer.  We all need a little more
khushoo
, some of us
more than others, but even the greatest and most devoted of us will at times
complain about their lack of
khushoo
.
Khushoo
in prayer means concentration, humility and submission.  It means
wholeheartedly fighting off any distractions or
waswaas
that enters our
minds when we should be entirely focused on worshipping Allah.  One of
Shaytan’s
most significant plots is to disrupt the prayer.  By doing this he achieves two
goals; he robs people from the joy of worshipping Allah and at the same time
makes them lose part or all of the reward.  One of the
sahabah
tells us
that Prophet Muhammad said, “The first thing you will lose of your religion is
khushoo
and the last thing you will lose of your religion is the
salah…”
[1]
“Successful indeed are the believers.  Those
who offer their
salah
with all solemnity and full submissiveness.”
(Quran 23:1-2)
We can say that we have achieved
khushoo
when a person is able to empty his heart and mind for prayer and focus on it to
the exclusion of all else and prefers to be praying rather than anything else. 
We all know that this can be very difficult especially when we are plagued by
the
waswaas
of
Shaytan
.
When a person stands with the intention
to pray the
Shaytan
feels jealous and begins an assault that is designed
to ruin the prayer.  He will distract the believer by all means possible, he
annoys him by whispering.  Did you make your ablution properly; did you leave
the stove on?  He will even use matters of the
deen
making you think
about anything other than the prayer.
Eight easy ways for gaining and maintaining
khushoo
.
1)Prepare for prayer properly.  You can do this
by repeating the words of the
adhan
and making
du’a
.  Paying
attention to your ablution and all the time remembering Allah
.
Also
making sure that your clothes and place of prayer are clean and tidy.  Allah is
of course the most deserving of our clean attire and surroundings.
2)Move calmly to the place of prayer and also during
the prayer.  Do not move through the positions of prayer like a chicken pecking
at the ground.  Haste prevents
khushoo
.
3)Remember death and what awaits us after death. 
Prophet Muhammad said, “Remember death in your prayer, for the man who
remembers death is bound to pray properly and pray the prayer of a man who does
not think that he will prayer any other prayer”.
[2]
4)Think about the words of the prayer and the
recited verses of the Quran.  The Quran was revealed to be pondered over.  It
would be helpful to read a
tafseer
.  Pause at the end of each
ayah
and even interact with the words.  For instance when Prophet Muhammad recited
an ayah that mentioned glorification he said
SubhanAllah
, if the
ayah
mentioned seeking refugee with Allah he would seek refuge with Allah.
[3]
5)Recite in a slow rhythmic tone and try to
beautify your voice.  Allah says in Quran,
“…And recite the Quran in a slow
pleasant style.” (Quran 73:4)
A slow measured pace is more conducive to
reflection.
6)Keep in mind that Allah responds to prayers.  Prayer
is a connection and con"

Introduction
There are special regulations in Islam
legislated for women regarding the three types of bleeding they experience,
that are menses, postpartum bleeding, and abnormal bleeding. Women must understand
the rulings pertinent to each type, as they deal with important aspects of
worship, such as purification, prayer and fasting. This lesson will try to
explain the most important rulings relevant to each type of bleeding.
Menstruation
Menstruation is the release of blood
and tissue through the vagina that occurs on a monthly cycle, not due to
specific events such as birth or breakage of the hymen.  Menstrual periods
usually occur once a month and last for several days.  Blood loss due to
menstrual flow may vary from month to month.  Women typically use sanitary
napkins (pads) or tampons to absorb menstrual flow. Menstrual blood is almost
always dark color and not bright.
Post-Childbirth bleeding
Such bleeding
occurs after the event of birth or miscarriage.  It has no minimum duration,
but it may even last up to forty days.  Umm Salamah said:
“During the lifetime of the
Prophet, the post-childbirth woman would seclude herself for forty days.”
(al-Bukhari)
A woman experiencing post-childbirth
bleeding has to stop praying for forty days unless her bleeding stops before
that.  If her bleeding stops before that time, she is to perform
ghusl
(ritual
bath) and start praying.  If she sees blood after forty days, most scholars say
that she is not to stop praying. The blood of postpartum bleeding is also
almost always dark.
Forbidden Acts
Divine wisdom has exempted women from
certain religious duties due to various reasons associated with bleeding.  The
following is a list of acts which are forbidden during menstruation and post-childbirth
bleeding:
(1)      Formal Prayer (
Salah
)
A woman experiencing her period or
post-childbirth bleeding is not to perform her prayers, whether obligatory or
voluntary, and those prayers which are missed due to this reason are not to be
made up at a later time.
If her blood flow starts after the time
for a certain prayer begins, for example, half an hour after the time for
Dhuhr
prayer, then, after her bleeding ends, she should make up that
Dhuhr
prayer,
since she was pure when the prayer became obligatory upon her. She should not,
however, make up the prayers she missed while she is bleeding.
[1]
If  there is enough time left to pray
at least one
rakah
(unit of prayer) after performing the ritual bath, she
should pray that prayer, because the Prophet said:
“Whoever catches with one unit of
prayer (
rakah
) before the sun rises has caught the
Fajr
prayer,
and whoever catches with one
rakah
before the sun sets has caught the
Asr
prayer.” (
Saheeh al-Bukhari
,
Saheeh Muslim
)
Example: if she performs the ritual
bath after the completion of her bleeding at the time of
Asr
and there
is enough time left before sunset for her to pray one
rakah
, then she
should pray
Asr
.
(2)      Fasting
It is forbidden for a woman experiencing
menstruation or postpartum bleeding to fast, whether it be for
Ramadan
or
voluntarily, but unlike the formal prayers she must make up the missed days of
Ramadan
.
(3)      Sexual intercourse
It is forbidden to have sexual
intercourse while a women is menstruating or experiencing postpartum bleeding,
although other types of intimacy are allowed.  As for anal intercourse, it is
forbidden at all times.  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, was asked “What is it permissible for me to do with my wife when she
is menstruating?”  He said:
“Do as you wish except for sexual
intercourse.”
(Muslim)
(4)     Touching a copy of the Quran
It is forbidden to touch a copy of the Quran
when one is in any state of impurity, because Allah says:
“… which none can touch except the purified.”
(Quran 56:79)
The Prophet told the people of Yemen:
“No one should touch the Quran
except one who is pure.” (
Malik
,
an-Nasa’i
,
Ibn Hibbaan
,
al-Bayhaqi
)
Permissible Acts
(1)  reciting the Quran from
memory.
(2)
Du’a
(supplication).
(3)  engaging in
adhkar
: remembering
Allah with specific words like
Subhan-Allah
,
Allahu Akbar
, and
others.
(4)  reading books of hadeeth or
any other Islamic books.
One should keep in mind that it is
permissible to read and touch a translation of the Quran, as it is not the word
of Allah but rather a"

What is
Istikharah
?
Istikharah
is a
du’a
made in conjunction with
non-obligatory prayer; it is a voluntaryprayer that Prophet Mohammad recommended
to anybody wanting to do something but feeling hesitant about doing it.  It is
seeking guidance in order to make the right decision.  It is reported that Prophet
Muhammad would teach his companions to make
Istikharah
just as he would
teach them verses from the Quran.  One should pray two units of non-obligatory
(voluntary) prayer and then say the
du'a
of
Istikharah
.

“O Allah, I ask
You to show me what is best, through Your knowledge, and I ask You to empower
me, through Your power, and I beg You to grant me Your tremendous favour, for
You have power, while I am without power, and You have knowledge, while I am
without knowledge, and You are the One who knows all things unseen.
O Allah, if You
know that this matter (mention the thing to be decided) is good for me in my
religion and in my life and for my welfare in the life to come, then ordain it
for me and make it easy for me, and then bless me in it.
And if You know
that this matter is bad for me in my religion and in my life and for my welfare
in the life to come, then distance it from me, and distance me from it, and
ordain for me what is good wherever it may be, and help me to be content with
it.”
When to recite the
du’a
of
Istikharah
It is permitted to recite the
du’a
of
Istikharah
either before or after the
tasleem.
Some scholars recommend before,
because Prophet Muhammad himself used to make a lot of
du’a
before the
tasleem
.
When to pray
Istikharah
Islamic scholars agree that
Istikharah
is suggested
when a person does not know the right decision to make.  If one is unsure about
whether or not his possible actions would bring about good in both this world
and the hereafter.  If a person is hesitating, not knowing if “it” is the right
thing to do then
Istikharah
is the
du’a
that may set his mind at
ease.  It is the
du’a
that acknowledges Allah as the only strength and
only power in this world.  His guidance is necessary to ensure that human
beings follow the straight and correct path that leads to a blissful life
everlasting.   For instance, if a person wants to
find out the right time
to do something, such as whether or
not to do voluntary
Hajj
this year
,
or to propose marriage to a
particular person, then it is acceptable and recommended that he or she prays
Istikharah.
Understand carefully that
Istikharah
is for matters that are
considered either recommended or permissible.  It is for cases in which there
is a conflict.  Should I give to this charity or the other? Should I apply for
this
halal
job or another? One shouldprays
Istikharah
concerning
the thing he or she thinks is more likely to be better and then go ahead with
doing it.
Istikharah
is not prayed for matters that are
considered obligatory acts of worship, or for staying away from sins and evil
actions.
It is recommended, before praying
Istikharah
, to
consult someone whom you know is sincere, caring and has experience, and who is
trustworthy with regard to his or her religious commitment and knowledge.
Common Mistakes
·
Believing that there is a set number of
times to pray
Istikharah
.
There is no set time period for praying
Istikharah
and it is permissible to repeat it more than once.
·
Believing in the need for a dream.
Some people believe that after praying
Istikharah
they should experience a dream or feeling of ease.  This is not correct.   Even
without such a thing, if a person makes a decision it should be hoped, due to
the sincere
du’a
of
Istikharah
, that this will be the best decision.

Arabic Terms:
·
Du’a
: Supplication, prayer, asking
Allah for something.
·
Shirk
: A word that implies ascribing
partners to Allah, or ascribing divine attributes to other than Allah, or
believing that the source of power, harm and blessings comes from another
besides Allah.
·
Halal
: Permissible
·
Taqwa
: Linguistically it means “to
protect” or “to shield”, as in to protect oneself from wrongdoing. In Islam,
Taqwa refers to consciousness of Allah. It describes a state of awareness of
Allah in everything you do.
·
Aameen
: An expression said at the end
of making a supplication, meaning ‘O Allah, please accept.’
·
Qiblah
: The direction one faces
during the formal prayers.
The Arabic word “
du’a”
means to ask your
Lord for His help and support. It can be translated as supplication or prayer. It
is a
form of worship
because Allah orders us to make
du’a
to Him:
“And your Lord says, ‘Make
du’a
to Me, and I will
answer you!’” (Quran 40:60)
Since
du’a
is an act of worship, the way it is
made, the procedure to be followed, and the manner to be observed when
performing this worship must be from the Quran and
Sunnah
.
Du’a
is closely related to one’s faith. One, it
is an open declaration that you believe in Allah and Allah alone. Two, it makes
you feel that you are not in control of your life, Allah is. This is why you
are going to Him and begging Him for your needs. Three, it reminds you that Allah
truly hears your
du’a
and will respond to it.
Since
du’a
is an act of worship, making
du’a
to someone other than Allah is an act of
Shirk
.
Du’a
can only be
directed to Allah and Allah alone. One verse from the Quran is sufficient to
illustrate this point:
“Say (O Muhammad), ‘I make
du’a
only to my Lord
(Allah), and I associate none as partners along with Him.’” (Quran 72:20)
Suppose a person makes
du’a
to other than Allah,
be it an idol or a saint, while believing that that being can hear him like
Allah, and can answer his
du’a
, then doing so is equating that object or
person with Allah. That is precisely
shirk
.
Benefits of
Du’a
:
1.
Du’a
is one of the noblest acts in the sight of Allah.
2.
Du’a
is the essence of worship.
3.
Du’a
is a sign of one’s faith.
4.Making
du’a
is obeying Allah.
5.Allah is close to the person who makes
du’a.
6.Through
du’a
Allah shows His generosity to us.
7.
Du’a
is a sign of humility.
8.
Du’a
repels Allah’s anger.
9.
Du’a
can save one from the Fire of Hell.
10.Making
du’a
shows having knowledge of the Almighty.
11.Allah loves
du’a.
12.
Du’a
sets
apart a believer from a non-believer.
13.
Du’a
is the weapon of the believer and those who have been wronged.
14.
Du’a
is a means of communicating with the Creator.
15.
Du’a
is an easy act of worship.
Before You make
Du’a
1.Realize that only Allah responds to
du’a
“Who else is there that responds to the call of the one in
distress when he makes
du’a
, and He removes evil from him, and makes you
inheritors of the earth? Is there any other god besides Allah? Little is that
you remember!” (Quran 27:62)
2.Be sincere towards Allah when making
du’a
“And those who you make
du’a
to (ask) besides Him can
neither come to your aid nor can they help themselves.” (Quran 7:197)
3.Don’t be hasty when making
du’a
The Prophet said, “
The slave will receive
a response so long as his
du’a
does not involve sin or severing of
family ties, and so long as he is not hasty.” It was said, “What does being
hasty mean?” He said: “When he says, ‘I made
du’a
and I made
du’a
,
and I have not seen any response,’ and he gets frustrated and stops making
du’a
.”
[1]
4.Make
du’a
for good things
Allah likes His slaves to ask Him for
everything that is in their spiritual and worldly benefit such as food, drink,
clothing, guidance and forgiveness etc. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Let
one of you ask his Lord for what he needs, even asking Him for the lace of his
shoe if it breaks.”
[2]
5.Make
du’a
with an attentive heart
Concentrate on making
du’a
,
focus on what you are asking Allah, put your mind and heart into it. Think of
what Prophet Muhammad said,
“Make
du’a
to Allah in a state that you
are certain that your
du’a
will be responded to, and know that Allah
does not answer a
du’a
from a heedless, inattentive heart.”
[3]
6.Earn your livelihood from an Islamically permissible source and
eat
halal
food
Selling alcohol and pork, gambling, theft,
and accepting bribes are all examples of impermissible sources of income. It
states in the Quran:
“Allah only accepts (deeds) from those who have
Taqwa
(who fear Him).” (Quran 5:27)
While Making
Du’a
1.Praise Allah before the
du’a
and send prayers on the
Prophet
The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)
saw someone make
du’a
. The Prophet instructed that person,“
…when you
finish your formal prayer, then sit down and praise Allah with the pr"

·Learn the matters that one should avoid when
supplicating to Allah.
·Identify the times when it is preferred to
make
du’a
.
Arabic Terms:
·
Adhan
- An Islamic way of calling
Muslims to the five obligatory Prayers.
·
Hajj
– A pilgrimage to Mecca where the pilgrim performs a
set of rituals.  The
Hajj
is one of the five pillars of Islam, which every
adult Muslim must undertake at least once in their life if they can afford it
and are physically able.
·
Iqama
- The second call to prayer. It
is similar to the
Adhan
and is said right before the prayer starts.
·
Dhul-Hijjah
- The twelfth month of
the Islamic calendar. It is the month in which the obligatory pilgrimage is performed.
·
Ramadan
- The ninth month of the
Islamic lunar calendar.  It is the month in which the obligatory fasting has
been prescribed.
Things to Avoid While Making
Du’a
1.Don’t go beyond limits
What it means is asking Allah for things He has
forbidden. For example, while it is fine to pray to Allah to marry someone, it
is forbidden to ask Allah to give you a girl friend or a boy friend, or to win
a lottery.
2.Not expecting an answer
A Muslim should hope that Allah will answer His
du’a
as Allah is Merciful to His slaves and powerful to grant them their wishes.
3.To ask for things of this world only in
du’a
Think about it, what is greater, this world or the
hereafter? For a true believer, it is obvious that what Allah has prepared in
the life to come is greater. Therefore, a Muslim who understands this point
will ask Allah for the blessings of the Hereafter as well.
4.To address Allah with improper Names
Remember this simple rule: do not address Allah or use
any Name of Allah that is not from the Quran or
Sunnah
. Addressing Allah
with words like “Big Guy.”
5.Do not make
du’a
against yourself or your family and do
not curse others.
A point to remember, as a person may pray against a
family member or even himself in a fit of rage and start cursing.
6.Do not pray for your death
Your life is Allah’s gift to you, do not ask Allah to
take it away!
Preferred Times When
Du’a
Is Likely to Be Accepted
Du’a
can be made at any time, but it is more
likely to be accepted at the following times:
1.
Du’a
in the last third of the night
Allah informs us in the Quran describing the believers,
“and they seek forgiveness from their Lord in the hours of the
dawn.” (Quran 51:18)
How do you calculate the last third of the night? The
night extends from the time of sunset till the time for Fajr begins. For
example, say sunset is at 5pm and Fajr for next day starts at 5am. The night is
12 hrs. A third of a night is 4 hrs. The last third of the night will be from
1am-5am.
2.
Du’a
when
Adhan
is called
The Prophet said, “
When the
Adhan
is called,
the doors of the skies are opened, and the
du’a
is answered.
” (
Saheeh
Muslim
)
3.
Du’a
Between
Adhan
&
Iqama
This is one of the best times for the prayer to be
accepted that is given to a believer to ask from Allah for his needs of this
world and the Hereafter.
4.
Du’a
while prostrating (kowtowing)
This is the best posture that a worshipper can be in
because it is the height of humility. Allah loves this posture the most. The
Prophet, may Allah praise him, said: “
The closest that a person is to his
Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of
du’a
then.
” (
Saheeh
Muslim
)
5.
Du’a
before the conclusion of formal prayer
Before concluding the formal prayers, by saying
‘As-Salamu
‘Alaikum wa-Rahmatullah’
a person can make any
du’a
that he likes at
this time as it is one of the times when prayers are responded to.
6.
Du’a
after the obligatory formal prayer
When asked which
du’a
is most likely to be
responded to, the Prophet said, “
In the last part of the night and after the
obligatory prayers.
” (
Tirmidhi
)
7.An hour on Friday
Prophet Muhammad said: “
On Friday there is an hour
when, if a Muslims happens to pray at that time and ask Allah for something
good, He will give it to him
” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
8.
Du’a
in Ramadan, the month of fasting
Prophet Muhammad said: “
When Ramadan comes, the doors
of mercy are opened and the doors of Hell are closed, and the devils are locked
up.
” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim
)
9.First ten days of the Islamic month of Hajj (
Dhul-Hijjah
)
The Islamic month in which the annual pilgrimage, or
Hajj, is performed, is a blessed month. The Prophet said about the first ten
days of this month,
“There are no days during which good deeds are more
beloved to Allah than during these ten days.”
(
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
10.During rainfall
The Prophet said,
“Two are the
du’as
that are
never returned: the
du’a
made when the
Adhan
is called and at the
time of rainfall.”
(
Abu Daud
)"

·
Qada’
– Making up missed prayers.
A Muslim is required to wash his feet when making
wudoo
. 
In some circumstances Islamic law waives washing of the feet and allows a
Muslim to wipe over the socks.  This is called
masah
in Arabic.
Wiping Over Socks
The following three conditions must be met for wiping
over socks to be valid:
(1)  You should have worn the socks after washing
the foot in a previous
wudoo
or
ghusl
(ritual bath).
(2)  The sock must cover the whole foot including
the ankle.
(3)  You can only wipe on the sock within the time
period allowed to do so.
(4) You should not have taken off the sock after
breaking
wudoo
.
Time Period for Wiping Over Socks
If you are not traveling, you can wipe over your socks
for twenty-four hours.  If you are traveling, you may do so for three days; that
is seventy-two hours.  At the end of the period, you must take off your socks
and wash your feet for a new
wudoo
.
If you have
wudoo
at the end of twenty-four hours
or three days (if traveling), you are not required to renew
wudoo
until
you break it.  The 24-hr/72hr time begins when you first wipe over your socks. 
Acts that break regular
wudoo
are the same acts that break
wudoo
done with wiping.  For example, sleep would break your
wudoo
, but a wet
dream would require you take a bath (
ghusl
).  Wiping over socks is not
compulsory, even when traveling, and the rule applies to both, men and women.
Method
The method to be used when wiping over socks is to pass
wet hands over the top of the socks.  The sole of the sock is not wiped.  It
does not matter which hand you use to wipe each sock, but it is better to wipe
both simultaneously.
You may wipe over shoes which reach above the ankle as
well with the same conditions mentioned for socks. Like socks, you may not wipe
over the shoes if you remove them after having broken your
wudoo
,
rather, in this case, you will have to make
masah
over the socks
underneath them.
Making up Missed Prayers
Making up prayers missed intentionally or
unintentionally is called
qada’
in Arabic.  We will only discuss making
up the
salah
if you missed it unintentionally.  A person who misses a
salah
is responsible for performing it no matter how late he remembers it.  The
Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“If anyone misses a
salah
, he must pray it
when he remembers it.  There is no expiation except the
salah
itself.”
[1]
For example, if you remember at the time of
Asr
that you have missed
Dhuhr
, you should make up
Dhuhr
and then
pray
Asr
.
Method
If you sleep through a
salah
, meaning the time
for that prayer has passed and you have slept through it, you must make
wudoo
upon waking up and offer it.  One night, during a journey with the Prophet,
some people said, ‘If only the Prophet would take rest with us during the last
hours of the night.’  He replied,
‘I am afraid you will sleep and miss the
Fajr
salah
.’
Bilal said, ‘I will wake you up.’  They all went to sleep, but
Bilal also fell asleep!  The Prophet woke up when the sun began to rise and
said,
‘O Bilal, what happened to your statement?’
He replied, ‘I have
never slept so much!’  The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said,
‘Allah took our souls when He wished and released them when
He wished.  O Bilal, get up and call the
Adhan
for prayer.’
The
Prophet then made
wudoo
and when the sun came up completely, he stood up
and prayed.
[2]
Prayer of the Traveler
Islamic law makes the
salah
easier for a traveler
in two ways:
By shortening prayers: the four
rakah
salah
is shortened to two
rakahs
.
By combining prayers:
Dhuhr
can be combined with
Asr
,
Maghrib
can be combined with
Isha
.  Prayers, however, cannot be
combined in any other way.
Fajr
cannot be combined with
Isha
,
Fajr
cannot be combined with
Dhuhr
.
Asr
can not be combined with
Maghrib
.
Conditions
Prayers can be shortened when one is traveling.  You cannot
shorten the prayers unless you have actually left your city limits.  There is
no time limit as to how long you can shorten the prayers.  The majority of
scholars allow it for up to four days and nights, though.  In case of bad weather,
prayers can be co"

The five most important and essential acts of worship in Islam
are simply known as the “pillars of Islam.”  They are the “
shahadah
”
(the testimony that no one deserves worship except Allah and Muhammad is the
Messenger of Allah), the five daily prayers,
zakah
, fasting, and the
hajj
pilgrimage.  A Muslim has to first and foremost focus on learning and
practicing these pillars before focusing on other aspects of Islam.
The word ‘
zakah
’ is usually translated as ‘poor
due’ or ‘alms tax.’  Actually, no single word can translate
zakah
properly.
Before the word
zakah
is explained, it is best
understood with another word, “
sadaqah
.”
Zakah
and
sadaqah
are different.
Zakah
is obligatory charity and is required, whereas
sadaqah
is voluntary
charity and is a recommended act that brings extra reward.  Moreover,
zakah
is the third pillar of Islam.  Not paying
zakah
out of negligence is a
sin, whereas a person is generally not sinful for not paying voluntary charity. 
That is why it is called “voluntary” charity!
Zakah
is calculated
precisely and can only be given to specific recipients, whereas
sadaqah
is not bound by such regulations.
Zakah
has to be given yearly, whereas
sadaqah
can be given only once or as frequently as one likes.
Spirituality of
Zakah
Zakah
is a beautiful act of worship that is
intimately tied to purification.  As a matter of fact, spending one’s wealth in
zakah
purifies the heart from the love of material wealth.  A person who
offers the gift of his wealth affirms the truth that to him nothing is dearer
than the love of Allah and he is prepared to sacrifice even his wealth to
please Allah.  The Prophet Muhammad said,
‘Whoever pays the
zakah
on his wealth will
have its evil removed from him.’
[1]
Exact Definition of
Zakah
In Islamic Law (
Shariah
), words are clearly
defined.
Zakah
is no exception.
Shariah
defines
zakah
to
be specific portion of one’s wealth that one must give yearly to a specific
group of recipients that are mentioned in the Quran.
Importance of
Zakah
& the Punishment for Not
Paying It
Zakah
represents the compassion of Islam towards
the poor and needy.
Zakah
is not a tax, but it is an act of worship for
which one receives reward from Allah.  Not paying the
zakah
is a sin.  Denying
its obligation is an act of disbelief.
The Quran tells us about the fate of those who refuse to
pay
zakah
.  It says,
“…And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it
in the way of Allah, warn them of a painful suffering (in the life to come).  On
that day when (the hoarded wealth) will be heated in the fire of Hell and with
it their foreheads, their sides, and their backs will be branded (and it will
be said to them), ‘This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves, so
taste what you used to hoard.’” (Quran 9:34-35)
What is
Nisaab
?
Zakah
is not to be paid unless the wealth reaches
a minimum level called “
nisaab
.” Think of
nisaab
as a scale to
help you determine if you are required to pay
zakah
.  Different forms of
wealth have different
nisaab
:
Silver 595gm
Gold 85gm,
3 US oz, or 2.74 troy oz of pure gold
Cash
& Savings      Equal to the value of 85 gm of gold or 595 gm of silver, whichever
works out to be less.
Zakah
on above items is 2.5% of their value.  If
the
nisaab
is met in any one form of wealth,
zakah
becomes
applicable only on that particular form of wealth and is calculated on the
total (
nisaab
plus excess) of that.
The prices of gold and silver vary everyday in
international markets.  For example, on August 15, 2012 the price of gold was approximately
$51.54/gm and for silver was $0.89/gm, hence the
nisaab
for gold was
approximately $4380.9 ($51.54 x 85 grams) and the
nisaab
for silver was
approximately $529.55 ($0.89 x 595 grams).  Gold and silver prices can be
obtained from www.goldprice.org
When is
Zakah
Due?
Many Islamic rules and regulations depend on the Islamic
lunar year.
Zakah
is one of them.  If you have had wealth more than the
nisaab
for one (lunar) year, then you just pay the
zakah
.  Though
not
required, but most people calculate their
zakah
Ramadan to
Ramadan.  You can fix to calculate and pay your
zakah
every 1
st
or 15
th
of Ramadan.
Example: Say you have $2000/- and 800 grams of gold f"

Zakah
on Stocks, Shares, & 401K
Zakah
is calculated at a standard rate of 2.5% of
total portfolio value at the
zakah
due date because they are bought with
expectation of profit, and readily traded for money.
Short-term traders should estimate stock values on an
established annual
zakah
due date, regardless of stock purchase dates or
value fluctuations, and pay 2.5% of total portfolio value.
It seems best to consider all accounts - 401(k), Keogh,
IRA, SEP-IRA, Roth IRA, etc.  - as zakatable at the rate of 2.5% annually.  Usually
not all the money is accessible to the investor for withdrawal, up to 50%
normally being allowed.  Therefore, the following formula is suggested by some
scholars:
Withdrawal Amount - Prescribed Penalty - Prescribed
Tax = Zakatable Amount
Who Can Receive
Zakah
?
The Quran tells us who is entitled to receive
zakah
. 
The eight categories are found in the Quran in Chapter at-Tawbah, 9:60:
1.  The Poor
Poor people who do not have sufficient money to meet
their needs are qualified to receive
zakah
.  It does not mean they are
penniless, but cannot make their ends meet, yet they do not ask others for help
out of modesty and a sense of self-respect.
2.  The Destitute
These are people who are so poor that they have nothing
to meet their needs.  Obviously, they are in worse condition than the first
category.
3.
Zakah
Administrators
People responsible for collecting and distributing
zakah
could be paid for their work from
zakah
funds.  They can receive wages
whether they are poor or not.
4.  Reconcile Hearts
People who have recently accepted Islam can be given
zakah
. 
People can also be given money from
zakah
to seek their support or to
prevent their opposition.
5.  Freeing Slaves
In the past,
zakah
money was also used to buy
slaves their freedom.  The Quran has legislated it to be one of the legitimate ways
to spend the money from
zakah
.  It is a clear expression of the
compassion of Islam towards treatment of slaves when they existed.  Islam
raised freeing slaves to an act of worship pleasing to God.  No other religion
has ever done that as far as this author is aware of.
6.  Paying Debts
People who are overburdened with debt and do not have a
way to pay on their own can also receive
zakah
funds.  The debt can be
due to medical reasons, marriage, or other lawful expenses.
7.  Cause of Allah
Wealth can also be spent in the cause of Allah.  The
traditional understanding held by the classical scholars of Islam is that this
category is reserved for jihad or a legitimate war.  Later scholars have
included efforts for the spread and ideological defense of Islam in this
category as well.
8.  Travelers
People used to get stranded in the past while traveling
with no access to their funds back home.  It happens sometimes today as well.  In
such situations, those travelers may be given money from
zakah
.  The
condition is that their journey should not be in disobedience of Allah, but for
an acceptable cause like seeking knowledge, looking for a job, or doing
business.
Who Can Not Receive
Zakah
?
A wealthy person cannot give
zakah
to his or her
parents because they are the child’s responsibility.  Also, a husband cannot
give
zakah
to his wife as she is his financial responsibility.  Furthermore,
a non-Muslim cannot be given
zakah
according to the majority of scholars. 
Poor non-Muslims can be helped with
sadaqah
or voluntary charity.
Practical Tips on Giving
Zakah
1.    You can give money to a poor and needy
Muslims directly if you know them.
2.    Your local Islamic center most likely
collects
zakah
and distributes it to the needy of the local community or
works with a charitable organization.  Therefore, you can always ask the local
mosque if they accept
zakah
.  You might even find boxes labeled “
zakah
”
in the mosque in which you can simply drop your check or cash for
zakah
.
3.    Furthermore, you can search online and find
numerous Islamic charitable organization that collect
zakah
to sponsor
orphans or distribute food or medicine in disaster-struck areas.
The following are just some of the organizations you can
give your
zakah
to:
www.zakat.org
www.islamic-relief.com
www.hhrd.org
Miscellaneous Issues
Zakah
is to be paid on gold and silver jewelry.  The
zakah
on the gold will be calculated according to the gold content in
the jewelry (i.e.  karats) and its value in the market.  Hence when calculating
the value of your gold, you must consult a jeweler for the correct value (based
on the content and weight).  Any stones in the jewelry are not subject to
zakah
.
You must have the intention to pay
zakah
when you
give it out.  In other words,"

is a piece of information or a story. In Islam it is a narrative record of the
sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad and his companions.
·
Hajj
- A pilgrimage to Mecca where
the pilgrim performs a set of rituals.  The
Hajj
is one of the five
pillars of Islam, which every adult Muslim must undertake at least once in
their life if they can afford it and are physically able.
·
Rakah
- unit of prayer.
·
Ramadan
- The ninth month of the
Islamic lunar calendar.  It is the month in which the obligatory fasting has
been prescribed.
The first thing to understand is the difference between
what is known as
fard
and what is known as
nafl
.
Fard
is
obligatory, it is what Allah requires us to do, and leaving it is a sin and we
will be held accountable for it.  An example is two
rakah
of
Fajr
prayer and the fasts of
Ramadan
.
Nafl
literally means extra.
Nafl
worship
is voluntary, it is not required from a Muslim, rather it is up to the
individual to offer it.  It is optional and voluntary.  The Muslim is not
sinful for neglecting
nafl
, but is rewarded for doing it.  Therefore,
nafl
worship is recommended.  Examples of
nafl
fasts will be covered in this
lesson.
Many times a new Muslim is anxious about fasting the
whole month of
Ramadan
(9
th
Islamic month).  Voluntary fasts
provide an excellent opportunity to practice fasting while earning rewards
before
Ramadan
approaches.  At the same time, one must remember not to
burn out, but to be gradual without being negligent.
The Most Important
Nafl
Fasts
1.       Six Days in the Month of
Shawwal
(the month following
Ramadan
or the 10
th
Islamic month)
The Prophet said,
“Whoever fasts during the month of
Ramadan
and then follows it with six days of
Shawwal
will be (rewarded) as if he
had fasted the entire year.”
[1]
It is forbidden to fast on the day of
Eid
or
Eid-ul-Fitr
to be specific.  You can keep these six fasts anytime after the day of
Eid
and
they do not have to be kept consecutively.   If you wish you can fast them separately
as long as they are completed within the month of
Shawwal
.
2.       Fasting the Ninth Day of
Dhul-Hijjah
(12
th
Islamic month)
The Islamic month in which the
Hajj
is performed
is known as
Dhul-Hijjah
.
Yaum ul-Arafah
or the “Day of Arafah”
is the ninth day of that month.
It is recommended for those not performing the
Hajj
pilgrimage to fast this day as the Messenger of Allah said:
“Fasting on the
day of Arafah is an expiation for two years, the year preceding it and the year
following it.”
[2]
3.       Fasting the Tenth Day of the Islamic Month of
Muharram
(1
st
Islamic month)
Muharram
is the first month of the Islamic lunar
calendar.  The tenth day of this month has a special name – “
Ashura
.”
What does one get for fasting it? The Prophet informed us,
“Fasting the day of
Ashura
is an expiation
for the past year.”
[3]
4.       Fasting Mondays and Thursdays
Abu Hurairah, the close companion of Prophet Muhammad,
reported that the Prophet would fast on Mondays and Thursdays.  When asked
about that, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said:
“The actions are presented on every Monday and Thursday.  Allah
forgives every Muslim or every believer, except for those who are boycotting
each other.  He says (about them): ‘Leave them.’”
[4]
When the Prophet
was asked about fasting on Mondays, he said
: “That is the day on which I
was born and the day on which I received revelation.”
[5]
5.       Fasting most of the month of Sha’ban (8
th
Islamic month)
Sha’ban
is the name of the Islamic month that
comes before
Ramadan
.  The Prophet would fast most of the month of
Sha’ban
.
‘Aisha, the wife
of the Prophet, said:
“I never saw the Messenger of Allah fast a
complete month except for
Ramadan
, and I have never seen him fast more
in a month than he did in
Sha’ban
.”

& Voluntary

Preview of Fasting
Fasting is not unique to
Muslims. It has been practiced for centuries in connection with religious
ceremonies by Christians, Jews, Confucians, Hindus, Taoists, Jains, and others
as Allah says:
“O you who believe, fasting is
prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may
become righteous.” (Quran 2:183)
But like other rituals fasting
was also altered and corrupted.
Fasting in Primitive Societies
Fasting was made part of the
fertility rites in primitive ceremonies which were held at the vernal and
autumnal equinoxes and survived for centuries.  Some primitive societies fasted
to avert catastrophe or to serve as penance for sin.  Native North Americans
held tribal fasts to avert threatening disasters.  The Native Americans of
Mexico and the Incas of Peru observed penitential fasts to appease their gods. Past
nations of the Old World, such as the Assyrians and the Babylonians, observed
fasting as a form of penance.
Fasting in Judaism and Christianity
Jews observe fasting as a form
of penitence and purification annually on the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur,
which corresponds to the tenth of Muharram (
‘Ashura
) of the Islamic
calendar.  On this day neither food nor drink is permitted.
Early Christians associated
fasting with penitence and purification. During the first two centuries of its
existence, the Christian Church established fasting as a voluntary preparation
for receiving the sacraments of Holy Communion and baptism and for the
ordination of priests. Later, these fasts were made obligatory, as other days
were subsequently added.  In the 6th century the Lenten fast was expanded to 40
days, on each of which only one meal was permitted.  After the Reformation,
fasting was retained by most Protestant Churches and was made optional in some
cases. Stricter Protestants like the Puritans, however, condemned not only the
festivals of the Church, but its traditional fasts as well.
In the Roman Catholic Church, fasting
may involve partial abstinence from food and drink or total abstinence.  The Roman
Catholic days of fasting are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
In the United
  States, fasting is observed mostly by Episcopalians and Lutherans among
Protestants, by Orthodox and Conservative Jews, and by Roman Catholics.
Secular Fasting: The Hunger Strike
From being an empty ritual,
fasting went to another extreme in the West: the hunger strike, a form of
fasting, which in modern times has become a political weapon after being
popularized by Mohandas Gandhi, leader of Indian struggle for freedom, who
undertook fasts to compel his followers to obey his precept of nonviolence.
Fasting in Islam
Islam has prescribed and
retained the ritual of fasting throughout centuries as a means for purifying
the soul of a man in order to draw near to his Creator by selfish motives and base
desires of self.  It has a special status among all the devotional worships
because it is difficult to perform.  It puts a bridle on the most uncontrolled,
savage human emotions.  The most unruly human emotions are pride, avarice,
gluttony, lust, envy, and anger.  These emotions, by their nature are not easy
to control, thus a person must strive hard to discipline them.  Fasting helps
do that.
The Islamic calendar consists
of twelve lunar months. Muslims measure their year by the cycles of the moon
rather than the sun, so the Muslim lunar year is eleven days shorter than the
Christian solar year. Muslims are forbidden to adjust their year by adding an
extra month, as the Jews do to keep their lunar calendar in synch with the
seasons.  Hence, the months of the Muslim year do not relate to the seasons. 
Each month lasts 29 or 30 days and occurs during different seasons of the
year.  A new month begins when the evening new moon is sighted.  The ninth
month is called
Ramadan
and is dedicated to fasting.  It is pronounced
Ramazan
by Indo-Pakistanis.
Below we list the virtues and
rewards of this month and fasting in general.  In the next lesson we will learn
how to fast.  In the third and final installment, we will discuss the social
aspects of
Ramadan
.  In the fourth and last lesson, we will learn about
the end of month activities.

Types of Fasting
First thing to know is that fasting is of two
types: obligatory and voluntary.  Obligatory fasts are required worship - as a
Muslim I do not have the option to leave it without incurring sin.  Voluntary
fasts are optional - I may keep them or not. If I don’t, I won’t incur any sin,
but I will get extra reward for keeping them.  In this lesson we will focus
only on the most important obligatory fasts that are kept in the month of
Ramadan
.
Fasting In
Ramadan
Fasting in
Ramadan
is one of the five
pillars of Islam as the Prophet said:
“Islam is built on five pillars: testifying
that there is no true god except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, the
establishment of the prayer, the giving of
zakah
, the fast of
Ramadan
,
and the pilgrimage to Mecca.” (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
Fasting in
Ramadan
is an obligation on every
Muslim who has reached the age of puberty.  Allah said in the Quran:
“So whoever witnesses the month should fast it.” (Quran
2:185)
Whoever does not fast
during
Ramadan
without a legitimate excuse commits what is considered
a major sin.
Who is Exempt from Fasting?
(1)  A Muslim child who has
not yet
reached puberty
is exempt from fasting till
one
of the following
signs of puberty appear:
(a) discharge of semen, whether by
experiencing a wet dream or otherwise
(b) growth of pubic hair
(c) menstruation
(d) a person has turned 15
(2)  If you are
traveling
in
Ramadan
,
you have the option not to fast. If you choose not to, you must make up for the
days missed at a later time before the following
Ramadan
.
(3)  A woman is not allowed to fast during
menstruation or post-natal bleeding, and she must perform the number of fasts
she missed on other days before the following
Ramadan
.
(4)  A
pregnant
or
breast-feeding
woman may be exempted from fasting if it proves harmful to her or the infant.  This
case is discussed in more detail below.
(5)  The
mentally insane
are also
exempt from fasting.
(6)  The Merciful Lord does not burden a
soul beyond its ability.  If you are
sick
, you are also exempt from
fasting.
There are two issues to know here:
First, how sick is sick?  Cough or minor
headache is not serious enough not to fast, but if there is medical reason, and
you know from experience, or are certain that fasting will make your illness
worse or delay recovery, you do not need to fast.
Second, you should make up the days when
you get better.
The chronically ill who do not foresee any chance
of recovery must feed a poor person for every day of
Ramadan
they miss.
They do not need to fast for them on other days.
(8)  Those
too old
to fast are also
exempt from fasting, and they too must feed a poor person for every day of
Ramadan
they miss.
How Do I Fast in
Ramadan
?
First, check with your local mosque for the beginning
of
Ramadan
by calling or visiting them.  Usually, mosques print a
special schedule for
Ramadan
that will tell you the times for starting
and ending the fast (the time of
Fajr
and
Maghrib
, respectively) and
maybe even the time for the
Taraweeh
prayer.
Second, intend in your heart the night before
that you will fast the next day based on what the Prophet, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“There is no fast for the person who did
not intend to fast from the night before.” (
An-Nasa’i
)
The idea is to remind yourself that one is
fasting for the pleasure of our Creator.

Your Islamic center will announce the end of
Ramadan
and the celebration of
Eid
.  The first day of the month following
Ramadan
is
Eid ul-Fitr
, the celebration of fast-breaking.  Very likely, in the
last few days of
Ramadan
, your mosque will also start collecting obligatory
post-
Ramadan
food (or money) due for the poor Muslims called
Zakat ul-Fitr
(Fast-breaking obligatory charity).
Zakat ul-Fitr
One of the companions of the Prophet said,
""Messenger of Allah made
Zakat ul-Fitr
obligatory to purify the fasting person from indecent words or actions, and to
provide food for the needy.  It is accepted as
Zakat
for the person who
gives it before the
Eid
prayer, but it is mere charity (like any other) for
the one who gives it after the prayer.""
[1]
We learn three matters regarding
Zakat ul-Fitr
:
(a)  It purifies the person who fasted
Ramadan
and cleanses him of indecent talk and minor sins performed during
Ramadan
.
(b)  This
Eid
is a day of eating and
drinking, as the month prior to it was one of fasting.
Zakat ul-Fitr
ensures that even the poorest of Muslims will partake in this outward show of
festivity.
(c)  Paying
Zakat ul-Fitr
is required
of every Muslim capable of giving for himself and on behalf of every family member
under his care.
The Quantity of Food
The quantity of food to be given out per person is
roughly equal to four handfuls of the two hands held together.  Its weight will
be different for different foodstuffs.  It is allowed to give money to a
charity organization or mosque so that they buy the foodstuff and distribute it
to the poor on your behalf, and that is why many mosques will offer to collect its
dollar equivalent from you instead.  You also have the option of giving the
food stuff to the mosque or charity organization, paying them to take care of
distributing
Zakat ul-Fitr
on your behalf, or you can give it out on
your own.
The Type of Food
The staple food of the people in your area may
be given.  Dates, barley, wheat, olives, raisins, wheat, and dried yogurt used
to be commonly eaten food in the time of the Prophet.  Today, pasta, rice,
beans, potatoes, cheese, and similar foods are more common.
The Best Time to Give It
The best time for it to be given out starts from
the eve of
Eid
until right before going to the prayer.
Permissible Time to Give It
You may offer it one or two days before
Eid
.
Delaying it after
Eid
Prayer
It is a sin to delay it after
Eid
prayer.
Who to Give It To?
It is given to a fellow Muslim with limited
financial means, but not necessarily in complete poverty.
Eid ul-Fitr
“
Eid
” means a day of social gathering.  In
Islam there are only three festivals:
(a)  The yearly
Eid ul-Fitr
(b)  The yearly
Eid ul-Adha
(c)  The weekly Friday.
Eid ul-Fitr
is a major festivity for the
Muslims, a time for gratitude to Allah, family bonding, fun, and merriment.  On
this day people greet one another and visit relatives and friends. Elaborate
dishes are prepared, new clothes are worn, presents are exchanged, and children
have fun.
The following are some recommended acts to be
performed on
Eid
:
a)
Ghusl
or bathing early in the day before the
Eid
prayer.
b)Beautifying
oneself: The Prophet used to wear his best clothes to go to the
Eid
prayer. 
He had a cloak that he wore specifically on the two
Eids
and Friday.
c)Saying
takbeer
(proclamation of the greatness of Allah) is
a distinctive feature of
Eid
and is mentioned in the Quran:
""…And that you should exclaim Allah's greatness
for having guided you, so that you may be grateful."" (Quran 2:185)
When?
The time for
Eid
takbeer's
starts
from the time a person leaves his house heading towards the prayer-hall.  The
Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, would leave his
house on the day of
Eid
saying
takbeer
until he had performed the
prayer.  He would stop saying the
takbeer
after the prayer.
What to Say?
There are various authentic narrations about
what should be said in the
takbeer
. For brevity, we will mention the one
which is most common.
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akar, La ilaha ill-Allah,
w’Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, wa lillahil-Hamd.

·
Taraweeh - These are special prayers performed
in Ramadan after Isha prayers and in which long portions of the Quran are
recited.
Ramadan is a month of fasting, reading the
Quran, and extra prayers; it is the month of good deeds and generosity. The
last ten nights of
Ramadan
are particularly special. Prophet Muhammad
would use these nights to exert himself in worship and generosity. The first of
these nights occurs on the eve of the 21st day of
Ramadan
. In other
words, it is the night that commences after the completion of the 20th day of
fasting.
Prophet Muhammad strove to do acts of worship during the
last ten days of
Ramadan
more than he would at any other time.
[1]
Since as
Muslims we strive to be like Prophet Muhammad in as many ways as possible this
is a time to ask ourselves what we can do to take full advantage of the special
nights ahead.
Attend the Taraweeh
One of the most beautiful and special parts of
Ramadan
is the opportunity to attend
taraweeh
prayers. They are offered throughout
the month. It makes a person feel as if they are part of the thriving community
of Muslims and it is a chance to really concentrate on the recitation of the Quran
and the words of Allah. If you have not been attending
taraweeh
or have
not really put your heart and soul into praying these prayers then the last ten
nights of
Ramadan
are an opportunity for you to increase your worship.
While most mosques offer
taraweeh
prayers after
Isha
prayer, you
will find that some also offer you the opportunity to pray more voluntary
prayers in congregation later in the night. If you are able to attend these
extra prayers offered usually after midnight but before the dawn prayer, you
will find many benefits, including the special closeness to Allah that can only
be experienced in the last part of the night. “Our Lord descends each night in
the final third of the night, and He says: ‘Who is saying a prayer to Me that I
may answer it? Who is asking something of Me that I may give it him? Who is
asking forgiveness of Me that I may forgive him?’”
[2]
A believer can also use the time between prayers to make
longer heartfelt
dua
. Prophet Muhammad said, “Whoever prayed at night in
it (the month of
Ramadan
) out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward
from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.”
[3]
Search for
Laylat al-Qadr
The rewards and blessings associated with this night are
many. There are many references to
Laylat al-Qadr
in the traditions of
Prophet Muhammad. Some of these indicate that
Laylat al-Qadr
falls on
one of the last ten nights of
Ramadan
, others point to it being an odd
numbered night in the last ten nights. Muslims are told in the Quran that
praying throughout this one night is better than a thousand months of prayer.
For this reason alone it would be wise for a person to seek out this blessed,
holy night by taking worship in these last nights very seriously.
God says in the Quran,
“Verily! We have sent it (this
Quran) down in the Night of Decree. And what will make you know what the Night
of Decree is? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. Therein
descend the angels and the Rooh (Gabriel) by Allah’s Permission with all
Decrees. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.” (Quran 97:1-5)
Practice
Itikaf
Aisha, the beloved wife of Prophet Muhammad reported
that he (Prophet Muhammad) used to practice
Itikaf
in the last ten
nights of
Ramadan
and said, “Look for
Laylat
al-Qadr
in the last ten nights of the month of
Ramadan
”
[4]
Itikaf
is a type of retreat when a person does not leave the mosque and
the remembrance of God except when it is absolutely necessary such as going to
the bathroom.
Renowned Islamic scholar Ibnul Qayyim described the
greater goal of
itikaf
.  “His (a person in
Itikaf
) thoughts are
all of remembrance of God, and thinking of how to attain His Pleasure and what
will cause nearness to Him. This leads him to feel contented with God instead
of the people, so that prepares him for being at peace with Him alone on the
day of loneliness in the grave, when there is no one else to give comfort, nor
anyone to grant solace except Him.”

Introduction
Fasting and charity are two very important concepts in
the religion of Islam.  Both are among the five pillars of Islam and both have
both voluntary and compulsory forms.  The compulsory form of fasting is the
fast that Muslims undertake in the month of
Ramadan
.  Voluntary fasts
can be performed throughout the year (except
Ramadan
).  The compulsory
form of charity is known as
zakah
and is a fixed portion of a person’s wealth
paid yearly.  Voluntary charity is known as
sadaqah
.  Fasting and
charity are often combined in
Ramadan
when Muslims try to maximize their
rewards.  The rules of fasting and charity can be found elsewhere, this lesson is
about the spiritual benefits to be gained from these acts.
Fasting (
Sawm
)
“Oh you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was
prescribed for those before you that you may gain self-restraint.”(Quran 2:183)
Fasting is an act of spiritual purification; it is an
important act of worship that was legislated in order to bring a person closer
to Allah and allow him or her to experience the benefits associated with piety. 
Throughout the day every time a person conquers his need to eat or drink he
remembers Allah.  Abstaining from food and drink is only one dimension of
fasting.
Abstaining from sinful behaviours is another dimension
that is often overlooked.  Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said that some people gain nothing from their
sawm
except hunger and thirst.
[1]
In another
hadith
he said that if a person does not give up false words and actions, Allah has no
need of him giving up food and drink.
[2]
Fasting purifies the
mind and helps a person gain control over his ego and base desires as well as teaches
a person how to modify his behaviour and change bad habits into good ones.
Sawm
also teaches compassion and empathy for those who go without food or water on a
daily basis.  Patience, gratitude and humility are all qualities that Muslims
strive to perfect and fasting is one way that help inculcate them in our daily
lives.
Fasting is a very special act of worship because it is
something that is between the fasting person and God.  God says in a
hadith
qudsi,
“Fasting is for Me and I alone will reward it”.
[3]
The
du’a
of the fasting person will not be
refused.
[4]
Thus making lots of
du’a
when fasting and at the breaking of your fast is highly recommended.  At the
breaking of fast Allah chooses people to save from the fires of Hell.
[5]
The end of the fast is also one of the two joyful moments associated with
fasting.  The other is when a person meets his Lord and celebrates his
successful fasting.
[6]
Fasting is also a strong
fortress that keeps a person safe from the fires of Hell
[7]
and in addition to this, on the Day of Judgment the fasting itself will
intercede for a person.
[8]
Charity (
Zakah
)
“Truly, those who believe, do good deeds, establish
salah
and pay
zakah
will have their reward with their Lord; no fear shall come
upon them, nor will they grieve.” (Quran 2:277)
The word
zakah
is mentioned approximately 30
times in the Quran and it is coupled with
salah
for almost all of them. 
It is a great act of worship that, like fasting, offers the chance for
spiritual purification.  In the case of
zakah
however it purifies the
heart of both the giver and the recipient and it detaches a person from the
greed and stinginess often associated with wealth.  A person who diligently
pays his
zakah
feels closeness to Allah and a responsibility for the
poor and needy.  To receive
zakah
is also a right given by Allah.  The
person who receives
zakah
finds his heart purified from the envy and
hatred that the poor often have for the rich and powerful.  Thus it strengthens
the ties of brotherhood.
The word
zakah
literally means that which
purifies and it was legislated by Allah for a number of reasons.  It

Introduction
Yearly millions chant the
Talbiyah
‘Lab’baik
Al’laahum’ma Lab’baik, Lab’baika laa Shareeka laka Lab’baik, In’nal Hamda wan
Ni’mata laka wal Mulk, Laa Shareeka lak’
[1]
.
This ‘
Talbiyah
’ is a miracle in the making;
generation upon generation, year after year, millions have said this and will
say it in response to the call of Prophet Ibrahim.  Allah, the Exalted, says:
“And proclaim to the people the
Hajj
[pilgrimage]; they
will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every
distant pass.” (Quran 22:27)
It is reported in the authentic tradition, that when
Prophet Ibrahim finished building the
Kabah
, it was said to him, ‘Call
out to the people!’ he then said, ‘My Lord, how far will my voice reach?’ It
was said to him, ‘Call out, and we shall relay your call and make it
far-reaching!’  Prophet Ibrahim then called out: “O people Indeed Allah has
prescribed pilgrimage (
Hajj
) upon you to the Ancient House (
Kabah
)!”
 People heard his voice and they responded coming from all over saying this
Talbiyah
!
[2]
In this series on
Hajj
, we will talk about some
important aspects of
Hajj
, things that should be in everyone’s mind
along with practical advice that will guide a person while performing it.
Virtues of
Hajj
There are many virtues for
Hajj
, what I will
mention here are the virtues that pertain to
Hajj
in general, and then
mention the rest of them as we discuss the procedure of
Hajj
.
1.It is the fifth pillar of Islam.  Allah, the Exalted, says:
“…And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the
House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way…” (Quran 3:97)
2.It is a duty a Muslim does with complete pride and submission to
God alone.  Due to its difficulty it is described by the Prophet as a form of
Jihad
(struggle); rightly so, as it requires of a person to sacrifice their money,
time and that they must be patient throughout the entire act of worship.  A’ishah,
may Allah be pleased with her said: “I said O Messenger of Allah! We view
Jihad
to be among the best of deeds; shall we not then perform
Jihad
?” He said
to her: “
The best
Jihad
(for you)
is a
Hajj
that is
accepted.”
[3]
3.This act of worship requires that a person dedicates all of his God-given
faculties to perfect it! God has promised those who perfect this act of worship
a great reward; the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said:
The accepted
Hajj
(
Hajj Mabroor
) has no reward except
Jannah
(Heavenly Abode).
[4]
4.The Prophet was asked: “What is the best deed in the sight of
God?” He answered:
“Belief in Allah!”
He was then asked,
“What is
next?”
He answered:
“
Jihad
in the path of Allah.”
He was then
asked,
“What is next?” He said: “An accepted
Hajj
!”
[5]
5.The Prophet said: “O Amr’ do you not know that
Hajj
effaces all sins done before it?”
[6]
6.The Prophet said: The one who performs
Hajj
and does not
engage in sexual activities with his wife during
Hajj
and does not give
into evil behavior (during
Hajj
) will return from that
Hajj
as
the day he was born (i.e.  sin free).
[7]
7.The Prophet said: “As the camel of a person coming for
Hajj
raises and lowers its feet as it walks towards Mecca for the pilgrimage, the
person who has intended the
Hajj
receives a reward for each footstep and
a sin would be removed with each footstep and he would be elevated a rank.”
[8]
8.The Prophet also said: “The one performing
Hajj
is the guest
of Allah; He called upon them to perform this duty and they answered that call!
They shall ask of Him and He will respond to them.”
Conditions of
Hajj
Scholars categorize the conditions for the obligation of
Hajj
into various sub-categories, but in general all are agreed that the
relevant conditions that are applicable today include:
1.Being a Muslim.
2.Intellectual sanity and rational capacity .
3.Reaching the age of puberty.
4.Capability (financial and physical).
The first condition of ‘faith’ is a pre-requisite in all
acts o"

Introduction
Hajj
is a pillar of Islam and an act of
worship that combines, belief, statements and actions; in short it is an act of
worship that requires your full attention.  It is wise for you to leave
shopping, chasing those extraordinary deals, which you will definitely see, for
after the
Hajj
season.
One important gadget that you shouldn’t forget is a cell
phone.  It is advisable that you not use an expensive handset during this
period, but simply resort to using a cheaper one that can be purchased at the
Pilgrims City (upon your arrival in  Saudi).  These cell-phones are usually
sold with a pre-paid SIM card.  Save the number of your group’s director and
Hajj
leader on the phone.
There are 3 types of
Hajj
and this series will be
explaining the most common type,
Hajj Tamattu’
.  In this you will
perform
Umrah
upon arrival from your country before the 8
th
of
Dhul-Hijjah
(the procedure of performing
Umrah
has been
explained earlier).
8
th
Day of
Dhul-Hijjah
We are now on the 8
th
of
Dhul-Hijjah
. 
It is known as the ‘day of
Tarwiyah
’ or 'the day of fetching water and
quenching thirst.' It is called by this name, because the pilgrims would get
ready for this long day and night by feeding their animals and making sure
their camels had enough water for the long journey ahead.  They would also stock
up on water in anticipation of the long stand on the day of Arafah, which was
usually a hot, long day!
When the day of
Tarwiyah
comes, one should enter
Ihram
in the morning from the place where he is in Mecca.  The Prophet, may the
mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him, donned the garments of
Ihram
at the
Duha
time (the time just after sunrise till just before the sun
reaches its zenith).  He should then say the following:
Lab’baika Haj’jan
(Here I am O Allah performing the
Hajj
) which indicates one’s
intention of performing the
Hajj
.  After that one should say the
Talbiyah
continuously:
‘Lab’baik Al’laahum’ma Lab’baik, Lab’baika laa Shareeka
laka Lab’baik, In’nal Hamda wan Ni’mata laka wal Mulk, Laa Shareeka lak’.
[1]
You would then proceed with your
Hajj
group to
the area of Mina, which literally is a tent city.  Millions of people gather
here on this day from all corners of the globe.  It is wise that you carefully
note the area that you are in; each is marked with a color and an
identification code.  If this fails, then you can simply ask for the general
location of the tents of your country.
It is important for one to try their best to be in Mina
before the sun reaches its zenith.  The pilgrim should busy himself with the
remembrance of Allah and recite the Quran.  One should avoid idle talk and discussion
of worldly matters and argumentation.
Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him said: “
I
heard the Prophet say, ‘Whoever performs
Hajj
and does not commit any
rafath
(obscenity) or
fusooq
(transgression), he returns (free from sin) as the
day his mother gave birth to him
’”.  (
Saheeh Al-Bukhari
)
While here, the pilgrim should perform each prayer (
Dhuhr
,
Asr
,
Maghrib
,
Isha
and
Fajr
) in its time.  They shouldn’t
combine prayers, but each four unit prayer is shortened to two units.
There is a very interesting
masjid
in Mina.  It is known as Masjid Kheef.  The Prophet, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Seventy Prophets
performed prayer in this
masjid
.”
(
Baihaqi
)
It is not required of one to visit that
masjid
or to pray there, some may carry this belief, but there is no
basis for it.
Depending on the bus schedule for your
Hajj
group, you may move from Mina to the next stop in
Hajj
shortly after the
Fajr
prayer or before the
Dhuhr
prayer of the 9th day of
Dhul-Hijjah
.

The 9
th
Day and Beyond
The 9
th
day is indeed a
precious day, thus, one is to utilize every moment of it in a productive
manner! One of the best things one can do is to supplicate to Allah for all
that they desire in this life and in the next.  Some may perceive it to be
inappropriate to ask Allah for worldly riches, but there is no sin in doing
this.  In fact, the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be upon him,
supplicated for Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, saying:
“O Allah
increase him in wealth, and give him many children and bless him in that.”
[1]
One
should make an extra effort to repent and pledge to Allah that they will turn a
new page in their lives.
At sunset, one is to leave the area of Arafah for
Muzdalifah
[2]
. 
Since one will be with a
Hajj
group, they may leave a bit earlier.  Upon
arriving at Muzdalifah one should perform the
Maghrib
prayer and
Isha
prayer (combining them and shortening the Isha to two units) thus allowing
oneself a good night’s rest thereafter.  A common mistake that is committed by
many is that they will spend their night chatting, taking selfies or surfing
the net.  This is inappropriate, as the Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of
Allah be upon him, indicated that one should spend this night resting as much
as they can.  One should continue saying the
Talbiyah
at this stage of
the pilgrimage.
The 10
th
Day (The Day of
Eid
)
This is the ‘action-packed’ day for the pilgrim.  The
majority of the
Hajj
rituals are performed herein.  It is best that one
follows this day’s rituals in the manner that Prophet Muhammad performed them
in.
Upon getting up for the Fajr prayer and performing it,
one is to utilize that time to supplicate to Allah, as well one should gather 7
small ‘chickpea’ sized stones for the ritual of stoning that takes place on
this day.
Taking a few extra is recommended
.
Usually after this, the
Hajj
group will take the
pilgrims back to Mina, where they will stone the biggest pillar, which is
closest to Mecca.  This pillar is known as Jamaratul-Aqabah.  It should be
noted that these pillars are not the ‘devil’, but simply a pillar.  In relation
to the reason behind this ritual, one can find its roots in the story of
Prophet Abraham and Ismail, peace be upon them both.  The devil had approached
Ismail and tried to convince him to disobey his father in these three locations. 
Today stoning is conducted in obedience to the commandment of our Prophet.  With
each stone that is thrown one is to say ‘
Allahu Akbar
’.
After stoning the Jamratul-Aqabah, one is to have their
sacrificial animal slaughtered.  Nowadays, this process is more or less
automated through one of the large corporations that takes care of this on
behalf of the pilgrims.  Once this step is ascertained, one can shave off or
trim their hair evenly.  For women, it is sufficient to clip off a small amount
of hair.
Once these actions are completed, one would then head
towards the Haram to perform what is known as
Tawaf
Al-Ifaadah, and the
Sa’ee
of
Hajj
.  These are the five actions that one should perform in this day. 
Once the
Tawaf
is about to be performed, one should stop saying the
Talbiyah
and instead say: “
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La ilaahah il-lal-lah.  Allahu
Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Wa-lil-laahil-hamd
”.
[3]
Due to the infinite mercy of Islam, the Prophet gave
us permits which make it easy for us this great undertaking.  Imagine, if all
the pilgrims had to strictly follow this order, what immense and massive
difficulty would there be upon people! In fact, the Prophet, was approached by
many companions who had informed him that they did not do the actions of this
day in his sequence.  The Prophet said to them:
“You may do that, and there
is no sin upon you!”
One Companion even came to him and said: “O Prophet of
Allah, I performed
Sa’ee
before I made the
Tawaf
!” The Prophet
said:
“You may do that, and there is no sin upon you!”

, they should
stay with their groups.  Getting lost during any stage of

Importance of
Umrah
Its importance is found in numerous texts; we will list them
here in point form:
1.“Be consistent and perform
Umrah
after having performed
the
Hajj
; for indeed it will remove poverty and sins in a manner similar
to a blacksmith who would purify iron, gold and silver.  Indeed the accepted
Hajj
has no reward except
Jannah
(Heavenly Abode).”
[1]
2.“Performing an
Umrah
followed by another will efface all
the sins between the two.”
[2]
3.“The
Jihad
for the elderly, weak and women is
Hajj
and
Umrah
.”
[3]
Pillars of
Umrah
There are three pillars of
Umrah
:
Ihram
Tawaf
Sa’ee
Ihram
:
Ihram
refers to a state that one enters, wherein one is prohibited from doing certain
things.  These include wearing perfume, clipping nails or cutting hair and
covering the head with direct head-gear.
[4]
A man wears two sheets called “
Izaar
” and “
Ridaa
” and he should
leave his head uncovered.  The “
Ridaa
” covers the upper part of the
body, whereas, the “
Izaar
” covers the lower part of the body.
A woman can wear her regular clothing, but she should not
wear gloves or a “
niqab
”.  She may draw her headscarf over her face in
the presence of non-
mahram
men.
Tawaf
:
It is the
circumambulation around the
Kabah
.  A person does this seven times.
Sa’ee
: It is the
walking and running between the hills of
Safa
and
Marwa
.
These are the three pillars of
Umrah
.
Umrah
also has two compulsory acts that must be met:
1.Entering the state of
Ihram
from outside the
Haram
(sanctuary) area (from a
Miqat
station).
2.Shaving or shortening the hair (for a man) and clipping a small
portion for a woman.
Procedure of
Umrah
Once a person arrives at the
Miqat
station,
whether this is by land or by air they must put on the necessary clothing of
Ihram
. 
A man may wear perfume on his body before entering the state of
Ihram
,
if he chooses, but not on his garments.  He should not apply perfume after
entering the state of
Ihram
.
Before leaving the
Miqat
station, one should say:
“
Labbaik Allaahumma bi
’
Umrah
”
(Here
I am O Allah in response to Your call performing
Umrah
). Upon saying
this one enters the state of
Ihram
.
They would then begin to chant the
Talbiyah
saying:
“Labbaik Allaahumma labbaik, labbaika laa shareeka laka labbaik, innal-hamda
wan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, laa shareeka lak”
[5]
.
They continue to chant this until they reach the
Kabah
and
begin to perform the
Tawaf
.  A man is to uncover his right shoulder
throughout the
Tawaf
; this is done by placing the middle part of the
Ridaa
under the right arm and tossing both ends of the sheet on the left shoulder.
Thereafter one is to circumambulate around the
Kabah
seven times; each time begins from the Black Stone.  One is not required to
physically touch or kiss it, but when one is in line with it, they begin their
circumambulation at that point.  During the
Tawaf
one should be mindful
of Allah, asking of Him and begging for His mercy.  One should avoid
idle talk and laughter, for this maybe a once in a lifetime
chance which should not be squandered heedlessly!
It is praiseworthy for one to walk with a faster pace in
the first three rounds.
The Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be
upon him, would say the following between the Yemeni corner and the Black
Stone:

In the previous lesson, we mentioned the conditions of
Umrah
and the procedure of how to perform it. As covered in part one, entering the
state of
Ihram
is a pillar of this great ritual. Since it is a very
essential part of the
Umrah
and
Hajj
experience, it is necessary
to shed further light on the ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ of this state.
Praiseworthy Practices
1.It is preferable to take the ritual bath before entering the
state of
Ihram
.
2.Cutting the fingernails, shortening the mustache, and
plucking/shaving armpit and pubic hair before entering the state of
Ihram
.
3.Entering the state of
Ihram
after performing an
obligatoryprayer.
[1]
4.Saying the
Talbiyah
: ‘
Labbaik Allaahumma labbaik…
’
after entering the state of
Ihram
. Men should raise their voices while
saying it and women can say it quietly to themselves.
Practices that should be avoided
Practices that should be avoided are referred to as ‘
Mahdthoorat’
of
Ihram
. These actions are not lawful for one who is in the state of
Ihram
.
They are divided into three categories; one specific to men, one specific to
women and one that is relevant to both.
Prohibited for Men and Women during the state of
Ihram
:
1.Cutting hair or shaving it from any part of the body.
2.Clipping fingernails or toenails.
3.Wearing perfume, regardless how subtle the scent.
4.Hunting game animals.
5.Consummating Marriage.
6.
Mubasharah
(i.e. contacting a woman skin to skin) or
doing a thing which may lead to it such as kissing or fondling.
7.Sexual intercourse.
Specifically Prohibited for Men:
1.Covering the head directly with a hat or a turban. Umbrellas or
sitting in the shade of a vehicle or in a tent are allowed.
2.Wearing sewn garments that are usually worn, such as
under-pants, t-shirts and other similar articles of clothing.
Specifically Prohibited for Women:
A woman should not cover her face unless men pass by
her. She can wear whatever she wants as long as it conforms to the Islamic
dress code, and she should cover her hair and she should not wear gloves.
Doing the
Mahdthoorat
ignorantly
If someone does one of these ignorantly he is excused. Whoever
does one of the above
Mahdthoorat
after entering the state of
Ihram
intentionally
would have committed a sin, and would be required to fast
three days or feed six poor/needy individuals.
Practices that are Lawful
1.Taking a shower.
2.Wearing a ring.
3.Wearing a belt.
4.Wearing sandals.
5.Using an umbrella.
6.Using a bandage.
7.Riding a bus.
8.Wearing a watch.
9.Wearing sunglasses.
Unauthentic Practices
Due to the sheer number of people who come from all
walks of life for the
Umrah
throughout the course of the year, it is
important that one not give in to popular beliefs that may be carried by some.
Islam is a religion of ease, not difficulty! Allah, the Exalted, says:
“And thus we have made you a just/moderate nation.” (Quran 2:143)
In light of this verse, we will mention here some odd
beliefs carried by some. One should be watchful for them and not subscribe to
them:
1.Believing that you need a special pair of sandals for
Umrah
.
2.Entering the state of
Ihram
before the
Miqat
station.
3.Chanting
Talbiyah
in a unison voice with a group.
4.Raising the hands, as done in prayer, when facing the Black
Stone.
5.Putting the right hand on the left hand during the
Tawaf
(circumambulation around the
Kabah
)
6.Making a specific supplication at each of the corners of the
Kabah
.
7.Kissing the Yemeni corner
[2]
.
8.Seeking blessings from the
Kabah
by wiping its walls with
a cloth or with the garment of
Ihram
.
9.Kissing and touching
Maqam
of Ibrahim (Station of
Ibrahim).
10.Praying two
rakahs
after completing the
Sa'ee
.
It is important for a Muslim to always follow the
example of our beloved Prophet, may the mercy and blessings of Allah be"

Without a Muslim family, substituting Christmas,
Passover, or other religious celebrations with Muslim festivals can be quite a change. 
But, there is no need to worry.  The first step to make a change is to read and
learn about a subject.  The second advice will be to follow the suggestions
given.  Third, make
du’a
to Allah, He is indeed your helper.  These
lessons will teach you everything you need to know along with simple ideas so
you can get more out of this amazing festival and fully experience Islamic
living.
Eid ul-Adha
Basic Facts
Islam has two beautiful celebrations that will be part
of your life:
Eid ul-Fitr
and
Eid ul-Adha
.  Some basic facts
about
Eid ul-Adha
:
·Pronounced EED-ul-ADHA, it can be translated
as the “Feast of the Sacrifice.”
·
Eid ul-Adha
is tied to
Hajj
-
the pilgrimage to the sacred city of Mecca that brings in 2 million Muslims
every year from all over the world.
·
Eid ul-Adha
lasts four days.  On the
other hand,
Eid ul-Fitr
, celebrated at the conclusion of
Ramadan
,
is a one day celebration.
·During
Eid ul-Adha
, many Muslim
families sacrifice an animal and share the meat with the poor.
In accordance to the command of Allah both Muslim
festivals were celebrated since the time of Prophet Muhammad. Hence they are from
Allah and authentic.  No human being made them up.  What is their spirit? Our
Prophet told us,
“They are days of eating, drinking, and remembrance
of Allah.”
[1]
In other words, we can enjoy and have
halal
,
wholesome fun without forgetting our Creator.
Before
Eid ul-Adha
As stated earlier,
Eid ul-Adha
is tied to
Hajj
. 
Performing
Hajj
is one of the five pillars of Islam that is performed in
the 12
th
month of the Islamic calendar known as “
Dhul-Hijjah
.”
Eid ul-Adha
is celebrated by Muslims all over the world on the 10
th
day of the month of
Dhul-Hijjah
.  The first ten days of this month have
a special merit.  In Arabic, they are known as
‘al-Ayyam ul-Ashr.’
The
season of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s
faults and make up for shortcomings or anything that one might have missed.
Virtues of the ‘Ten Days’
The following are five virtues of the
‘al-Ayyam
ul-Ashr’
(the Ten Days):
1.    Allah swears an oath by them in the Quran,
and swearing an oath by something shows us it’s paramount significance and genuine
benefit.  Allah says:
“By the dawn; by the ten nights” (Quran 89:1-2)
Early authorities of Quran have
explained that this verse refers to the first ten days of
Dhul-Hijjah
.
2.    To further convince us of their merit, the Prophet
testified that these are the “best”
days
in the world.  The
Ten
Days
are better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the
last ten days of
Ramadan
! But the last ten
nights
of
Ramadan
are better, because they include
Laylat al-Qadr
(“the Night of Power”).
3.    There are no days greater in the sight of
Allah and in which good deeds are more loved by Him than these ten days, so a
Muslim must frequently recite “
SubhanAllah
”, “
Alhamdulillah
” and “
Allahu
Akbar
” during this time.
4.    The Ten Days include the days of sacrifice
and
Hajj
.
5.    The 9th day of
Dhul-Hijjah
is called
‘Yaum
ul Arafah’
(The Day of
Arafah
).  This is the day when the pilgrims
assemble on the plain of
Arafah
, six miles away from Mecca.  The Day of
Arafah
itself has many virtues.
Virtues And Practices of
Day of Arafah
1.
Yaum al-Arafah
is the day on which
Allah completed the religion of Islam.
2.
Yaum al-Arafah
is one of the biggest
gatherings of any place in the world.
3.

Understanding Animal Offerings on
Eid ul-Adha
Sacrificing one’s son was a test of Abraham’s faith.  To
commemorate and remember Abraham’s trials, Muslims slaughter an animal such as
a sheep, camel, or goat.  The practice is often misunderstood by those outside of
the faith.  Therefore, several points must be understood here:
First, there are no special
rituals involved, other than the animal meeting certain requirements.  The
animal is slaughtered in the same way it is slaughtered any other time in the year. 
The only difference is in the intention.  For regular slaughter, the intention
is the meat, but for
Eid ul-Adha
, it is to worship Allah by commemorating
Abraham’s trial.
Two, God’s Name is
pronounced since Allah has given us power over animals and allowed us to
consume their meat, but only in His Name.  By saying the Name of Allah at the
time of slaughter, we remind ourselves that even the life of an animal is
sacred and we can only take away it’s life in the Name of the One who gave it
in the first place.
Three, good acts atone for
one’s sins.  Offering
udhiyyah
is an act of worship that is no exception. 
Prophet Muhammad said that the most beloved deed on
Eid ul-Adha
is
offering the
udhiyyah
and that it will come on the Day of Resurrection
with its horns, cloven hoofs, and hair.  Its blood is accepted by Allah before
it reaches the ground.  “So let your heart delight in it.” (Tirmidhi, Ibn
Majah)
Laws of
Udhiyyah
for
Eid ul-Adha
a)  Type of Animal
A single
sheep
can be offered as a sacrifice for
a single person or a family.  “At the time of the Messenger of Allah, a man
would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household,
and they would eat from it and give some to others.”
[1]
A camel or cow is
sufficient for seven people, because of the report
“A cow would be
sacrificed on behalf of seven men and we would share it.”
[2]
b)  Age of Animal
The animal should be of a certain age to be fit for
udhiyyah
. 
The minimum ages are:
a)6 months for a lamb or sheep.
b)1
year for a goat.
c)2 years for a cow.
d)5
years for a camel.
c)  Characteristics of the Animal
It should be free of any faults, because the Prophet
said,
“There are four that will not do for sacrifice:
a)
a one-eyed animal whose defect is obvious,
b)
a sick animal whose sickness is obvious,
c)
a lame animal whose limp is obvious and
d)
an emaciated animal that has no marrow in its bones.”
[3]
There are milder defects that do not disqualify an
animal, but it is disliked to sacrifice such animals, like an animal with a
horn or ear missing, or with slits in its ears, etc.  If the animal is
castrated, it is not considered a fault.
d)  Time of Sacrifice
It should be sacrificed at the specified time, which is after
the prayer and
khutbah
of
Eid ul-Adha
has concluded until before
sunset of the 13th day of
Dhul-Hijjah
.  The Prophet said:
“Whoever sacrifices before the prayer let him repeat
it.”
[4]
The meat from the sacrifice of
Eid ul-Adha
is
eaten by family and relatives, given away to friends, and donated to the poor. 
We recognize that all blessings come from Allah, and we should open our hearts
and share with others.

Procedure for The
Eid
Prayer (
Salat ul-Eid
)
The
Eid
Prayer is required (
wajib
). It
consists of two
rakahs
, with extra
takbirs
(saying ‘Allahu
Akbar’). The wisdom behind the
Eid
prayers, like the
Eid
days
themselves, is to thank Allah for His countless blessings. The
imam
will
pray in one of two ways. He will explain how he is praying before the beginning
of the prayer:
METHOD 1
In the first
rakah
of the
Eid
prayer, the
imam
will offer 3 additional
takbirs
after the
Takbiratul-Ihram
and
opening supplication but before reciting the
Fatihah
. Raise your hands
with each
takbir
, as one does for
Takbiratul-Ihram
. After each
takbir
,
let the hands rest at the sides. Place hands together after the third and final
takbir
. After this, the rest of the
rakah
is the same.
In the second
rakah
of the
Eid
prayer the
imam
will recite the
Fatihah
and some portion of the Quran. He will then say
3 additional
takbirs
. They are like the first
rakah’s
takbirs
,
except that you leave your hands to your sides after the third
takbir.
After
these three
takbirs
have been called and completed, one says the
takbir
for going into
ruku
, without raising one’s hands.
METHOD 2
Like any prayer, the prayer begins with
Takbiratul-Ihram
followed by the opening supplication. It is followed by 7
takbeers
in
the first
rakah
and 5 additional
takbeers
in the second
rakah
.
Rest of the prayer is like any other prayer.
Greetings Exchanged On
Eid ul-Adha
Not knowing the greetings flying around during
Eid
can be an uncomfortable experience. Not exchanging any greeting is perfectly
acceptable in Islam, but socially awkward. Therefore, knowing what are the
greetings and their appropriate response will help you with social acceptance.
People from India and Pakistan congratulate one another
by saying “
Eid Mubarak
” (Blessed
Eid
).
Arabs tend to say “Eid Saeed” (Happy Eid) or ‘
kullu
‘aam wa antum bi-khair
’ (may each year bring you good health).
The Companions of Prophet Muhammad used to say, ‘
taqabalallahu
minna wa minkum
’ (May Allah accept it from us and from you).
They are all fine. Simply respond by repeating the same greeting
back! It will be fine if you smile or ask for help in repeating back the words.
Advice for
Eid ul-Adha
1.    Take the day of
Eid
off from work or school.
If you cannot, please make arrangements for time off for at least the
Eid
prayer.
2.    Make arrangements for the sacrificial animal
ahead of time. You can go with local Muslims to a ranch or a slaughter house.
It will be an experience you will not forget! You may want to slaughter the
animal yourself or you can have a fellow Muslim do it for you. You can also
send money to an Islamic charity to do it on your behalf and they will distribute
the meat to the poor. For millions of Muslims it is the only time in the year
they get to eat meat. You can locate many charities by doing an online search
for “udhiyyah 2013.”
At least for the first few years after accepting Islam,
I will recommend that you simply send the money to feed poor Muslims overseas
either through your mosque or one of the online Islamic relief organizations.  You
can join the local Muslims to get the experience if you like. Costs of doing
udhiyyah
overseas will vary based on the country you want it to be performed in. A few
organizations are listed below, you can find many more online:
http://www.irusa.org
http://icnarelief.org
www.zakat.org
3.    Call your local mosque or Islamic center a
week before
Eid ul-Adha
to find out the time and place where
Eid
ul-Adha
prayer will be held. After the
Eid
prayer, ethnic sweets and
foods are usually served. Most mosques will hold
Eid
dinners either in
the evening or within the next few days. Find out when and where they are and
attend them.
4.    Do not get lonely or feel isolated. Make
arrangements with your Muslim friends or families ahead of time to visit them for
Eid ul-Adha
. Invite Muslim friends and cook for them. If you can’t cook,
eat out with them. Try to involve your non-Muslim family members by taking them

An Arabic to English dictionary tells
us that the word
ikhlas
means sincerity, purity or isolation.  The word
ikhlas
comes from the Arabic word
akh-la-sa
and it means to render a
deed free of
riyaa
so that there is no consideration other than Allah.  Bearing
this in mind, an Islamic glossary will often describes the word
ikhlas
as the act of purifying motives or intentions so that actions are done
primarily to seek the pleasure of Allah.  When we combine these definitions
with the English dictionary definition of sincerity - being free from pretence,
deceit or hypocrisy - we begin to understand what
ikhlas
is.
Ikhlas
is purifying one’s deeds from all
contamination by
shirk,
in order to worship Allah in the correct way.  For
a person to cultivate and maintain real
ikhlas
he must avoid anything
that calls into question Allah’s right to be worshipped  as the One.
Surah
number 112 is called Al-Ikhlas and it explains very clearly the Oneness of
Allah.  More detailed information can be obtained here,
http://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/253/
“Say, ‘He is Allah, (the) One.   Allah-us-Samad (The
Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks).    He
begets not, nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto
Him.’” (Quran 112)
Ikhlas
is being honest with Allah, and worshipping
Him with
ihsan
.
Ikhlas
is closely linked to
ihsan
.  When
a person is consistently aware that Allah sees all he is more likely to
remember the importance of
ikhlas
.  When a person does something
sincerely for Allah, he or she is no longer concerned with receiving praise or
reward from anyone but Allah.   It does not matter who sees you or who does not
see you.  Sometimes a deed can be done for Allah’s sake but the intention is
tainted with boasting and showing off; this is
riyaa
and it may nullify
the rewards that a believer is seeking.  More information about
riyaa
can be found here,
http://www.newmuslims.com/lessons/96/
and will be discussed further in part 2.
“And whether you hide what is in your breast or reveal it,
Allah knows it…” (Quran 3:29)
“…And if you join others in worship with Allah surely your
deeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers.” (Quran 39:65)
In order that a believer’s deeds and actions are
accepted by Allah they must be performed with
ikhlas
, they must be
preceded by the right intention and they must be carried out according to the
shariah
.
“And they were commanded not but they should worship Allah and
worship none but him alone, and give
zakah
, and that is the right
religion.” (Quran 98:5)
Prophet Muhammad emphasised that, “Allah is Pure and He
accepts only that which is pure”
[1]
thus
the
Sunnah
gives prominence to the fact that Allah accepts only that
which is pure and done solely for His sake.  For example, Khalid ibn al-Walid
was removed from his post as commander of the army by Caliph Umar.  Rather than
being offended and refusing to fight, Khalid fought even harder.  When he was
asked why, he said: “I fight for Allah not for Umar.”
Say, “Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and
my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.” (Quran 6:162)
The acceptance of a person’s deeds by Allah depends on
purity and sincerity; because it is with such
ikhlas
that a person can
attain a high rank in the sight of Allah.   In fact with the right intention and
a pure heart a person can even be rewarded for an action that they were unable
to perform.  Prophet Muhammad said, “Verily Allah has recorded the good deeds
and the evil deeds.” He then informed those around him that, “Whosoever intends
to do a good deed but does not do it, Allah records it with Himself as a
complete good deed…”

Ikhlas
means that one’s heart is pure and that he or she worships Allah solely to
please Him.  In lesson 1 we established that in order for a believer’s deeds to
be accepted by Allah they must be performed with
ikhlas
, they must be
preceded by the correct intention and they must be carried out according to the
Shariah
.  We will continue our lesson by discussing things that can
contradict or corrupt our
ikhlas; i-e, riyaa
.
Riyaa
is in fact
minor
shirk
, it makes us focus on gaining the admiration and
appreciation of people rather than seeking to please Allah.
A great scholar of Islam once said, “Indeed
the hardest thing to achieve in this world is
ikhlas
.  How many times
have I struggled to extinguish
riyaa
(showing off) from my heart except
that it only appeared again in a different colour”?
[1]
It is clear from
this statement that even the most educated people struggle to remain sincere
and avoid
riyaa.
But indeed it is something that we must avoid.   Prophet
Muhammad said that it was the thing he feared most for his
Ummah
.  “Indeed
the thing that I fear most for you is the minor
shirk
,” he said.  The
sahabah
asked, “And what is minor
shirk
, Oh Messenger of Allah?” To which he
replied, “It is
Riyaa
.  Allah will say to the people of
riyaa
on
the Day of Judgement – when the people are being re-payed for their deeds – ‘Go
to those who you showed off your deeds to in the
dunya
, and see if you
can find reward from them!’”
[2]
There is also a
hadith qudsi
in
which Allah says, “I am Independent of all the partners (ascribed to me).  Whoever
performs a deed while associating partners with Me, I will leave him and
his
shirk
.”
[3]
Riyaa
can be defined as the performance of a deed with the intention
of pleasing someone or something other than Allah.  It is a form of
shirk
and something to be feared because it is easy to fall into
riyaa
without
noticing.
Our good deeds and actions can be
nullified by
riyaa
.  Let us take the example of a man who has $100 he
wants to give in charity.   He begins his act of charity with a pure and
sincere heart and donates $50 but then the idea of showing how rich he is
occurs to him so he makes quite a performance of giving another $50.   It is
possible that Allah will reject the second $50 as an act of charity because it
was mixed with a desire to show off.  If however the idea of showing off
occurred after the total $100 had been distributed it would not affect or
invalidate the act of charity.
Having said this it is important to
bear in mind that it is not showing off if a person feels happy after doing an
act of worship.  This is a sign of faith.   Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said “Whoever feels happy because of his good
deeds and sad because of his bad deeds, is a believer.”
[4]
In addition, if people praise you for a
good deed it is nothing to be ashamed or afraid of, it is a porti"

The thing about knowing
the truth, understanding the purpose of life and knowing the answer to that age
old question of why am I here, is that it is exciting; jumping out of your skin
exciting.  Thus on discovery, the first thing you want to do is tell other
people, and sometimes just blurting out one of life’s universal truths can be a
little bit confronting.  Some might think you are crazy or deluded, but that is
not the problem, because that puts you in such noble company as Prophet
Muhammad or Prophet Noah.  The problem is that when we invite people to the
truth of Islam we want them to listen and understand just what it is we are
trying to say.  Therefore for the benefit of those jumping out of their skin we
will discuss a few tips for inviting others to the right path.
First off let us get our definitions in sync.  The verb,
invite,
means to request the presence or participation of in a kindly,
courteous, or complimentary way.
[1]
Shariah
literally means ‘a path to water,’ the source of all life, thus
Islamically
Shariah
is the straight path to Allah, the Giver and
Originator of all life.   Allah tells us to:
“Invite (call) to the way of your
Rabb
with wisdom and
beautiful preaching and argue with them in a way that is better...”  (Qur’an
16:125)
Whenever we invite a person to Islam, to the right path,
we are presenting them with the attractions and allurements of Islam.   Our job
is to deliver the message in the best way possible according to our knowledge
and abilities.  Acceptance or rejection of the message is up to the person
concerned; there is no compulsion in religion and moreover it is Allah who
bestows guidance.
We
are not converting or reverting them because it is
Allah, and Allah only that truly does that.  Our role is only to assist others
on their journey or to plant a seed that will one day,
InshaAllah
, grow
into a tree of Islam.
“Let there be no compulsion in religion.  Truth has been made
clear from error…” (Quran 2:256)
“…Say, ‘To Allah belongs the east and the west.  He guides
whom He wills to a straight path.’” (Quran 2:142)
It is important to remember however that conveying the
message and calling people to Islam or giving
dawah
, as many like to
call it, is an obligation upon all Muslims.  Of course we are not all expected
to work in the field of
dawah
but we are expected to be aware at all
times that our behaviour, words and actions, are
dawah
.  Those not
familiar with Islam look to Muslims to see just what this religion is all about. 
Prophet Muhammad said, “Convey from me, even if it is one verse”.
[2]
Quran also
reiterates the same message.
“...  And who is better in speech than one who invites to
Allah and does righteousness and says, ‘Indeed, I am of the Muslims. ’” (Quran
41:33)
It all sounds very easy doesn’t it?  We all love Allah
and His Messenger Muhammad and without a doubt we hope that all people will one
day feel the same way.  However love for Islam and all it entails is not quite
enough.  When one accepts the challenge to convey the message one needs to be
prepared.  No longer can we scowl at the shopkeeper when prices rise.  No
longer can we react with anger when somebody mumbles an insult as we walk by.  A
person delivering the message of Islam must be prepared to accept insults, be
patient, make sacrifices, and listen to ideas and ideologies that are far from
the truth of Islam.  Prophet Muhammad said that, “The believer who mixes with
people and bears their insults with patience is better than the one who does
not mix with people or bear their insults with patience.”
[3]
Anyone who is recognisably Muslim is conveying the
message every time they appear in public or mix with non-believers, therefore our
words should always be kind and gentle, and our temper must be completely under
control so that harsh words never leave our mouths.  One of Prophet Muhammad’s
companions said, “We smile at people even if in our hearts we are cursing their
words or behaviour”.
[4]
Moreover a Muslim makes things easy for others.  This is what Allah expects and
Prophet Muhammad encouraged when he said, “Teach and make things easy, do not
make them difficult.  If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.”
[5]
“...  Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make
things difficult for you…” (Quran 2:185)
Prophet Muhammad understood human weaknesses and at the
same time understood human potential for excellence.  His

These days supernatural phenomenon
is stressed in most modern fiction, movies, and TV programs.  Everyone has read
about witches, sorcerers, vampires, wandering spirits, and werewolves.  While
much of it is just that – fiction, according to Islamic teachings, there is an
element of truth to the supernatural phenomenon.  Some people may have direct
experience of the horror out there, who have always had questions, but never
had the right answers.
First we need to understand what is meant by
supernatural phenomenon.  “The Supernatural” is what lies outside nature and
hence outside science as well.  Therefore, what is supernatural seems
inherently mysterious and therefore scary.  Human beings fear what they do not
know.
Therefore, to sort out fact from fiction, we rely on the
only true source of supernatural knowledge, and that is Allah’s revelation
contained in the Quran and the
Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad.  Once we
understand that the supernatural can be understood through revelation, we
conquer our fear of the unknown as we learn ways Allah has taught us to keep us
safe and protected.
According to Islamic teachings, the following are the
major sources of supernatural harm:
Jinn and demons
The jinn are real and they are creatures
created by Allah.  Among them are demons (disbelieving jinn) and believers.  They
can see us but we cannot see them.  Demons can attack human beings and
terrorize them.  A demon may also possess the body of a human because it either
fell in love with the human or to harm him, or possibly another reason.
Envy and jealousy of others
Destructive envy means wishing that a
blessing that Allah has given another person be taken away.  Wishing to have
what somebody else has (an object or skill) is not envy, desiring it to be
taken away from them is what makes it destructive.
“Evil eye”
The “evil eye” is when a person hurts another
with his “stare.” The starting point is when the person likes something, and
then by repeatedly looking at the object of his jealousy, his evil feelings
affect it.  To clarify this in a more simple tone, if a person is in the
presence of someone whom he wishes to marry, and she happens to smile in his
direction, the individual may feel lightheaded and even dizzy at that point;
likewise, when a person is standing before someone whom he fears, such as his
boss, and he dreads that he will be fired, and he is suddenly called, that
person will feel a slight sensation of pain and may even faint. The evil eye
incorporates this aspect, as well it goes beyond by the nature of one’s
self…the jealousy and pure hatred a person has for a blessing someone is
blessed with and the burning desire that he has to see it removed. Everyone who
puts the “evil eye” on another is envious, but everyone who envies does not put
the “evil eye” on another.
Witchcraft and sorcery
Witchcraft and sorcery are real and may
affect people psychologically and physically, so that they become sick and even
husbands and wives can be separated.  Most of it is done by means of
Shirk
and by offering demons what they love.
The truth is that in and of itself, nothing is capable of
hurting you unless Allah allows it to.  In other words, you should have a firm
belief that Allah is in control, not any created being.  That is why, a Muslim
should not let paranoia, anxiety, doubts, suspicion, and excessive fear of the paranormal
overwhelm him so much that he becomes afflicted with psychological illnesses.  One
should think positively about Allah and understand that whatever befalls only
happens by the permission of Allah.  Evil is not outside of Allah’s control.  There
is no sorcerer, demon, or “evil eye” that is stronger than Allah.  Since, He is
in control, He alone is able to ward off harm and relieve distress.  If this is
understood, a person will turn to Allah and put his complete faith in Him.
In order to properly trust Allah, a Muslim must have the
correct belief and knowledge.  First, Allah knows what’s best.  Allah says in
the Quran,
“… Perhaps you may dislike something and it is good for you
and you may like something and it is bad for you.  Allah knows and you do not
know.” (Quran 2:216)
Second, Allah is Just.  He tells us,
“… And your Lord will not wrong anyone.” (Quran 18:49)
Third, Allah is sufficient for anyone who puts their
trust in Him.  He has declared,
“…And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice
him...” (Quran 65:3)
A Muslim can protect himself by giving up sins, carrying
out obligatory religious duties, having strong faith in Allah, by putting his
trust in Him as explained above, and seeking refuge with Him by reciting the
prayers for protection narrated from Prophet Muhammad.

Deen
- the way of life based on Islamic

Deen
is
often used to mean faith, or the religion of Islam.
When explaining the
message of Islam the most important thing to remember is
Tawheed
.  It
must form the basis of any explanation we give about any topic related to the
deen
.
Tawheed
is the basis of Islam and without a doubt our discussions must
emanate from this important principle.
Quran emphasizes that every messenger sent by Allah
began by inviting his people to
Tawheed
.
“And We sent a messenger to every nation (proclaiming): ‘Worship
Allah and shun false deities!’...” (Quran 16:36)
“And We never sent any messenger before you, except that we
revealed to him that ‘There is no deity worthy of worship except Me, so worship
Me’“ (Quran 21:25)
“Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, and he said, ‘O my people!
Worship Allah!  You have no other deity other than Him.  Certainly, I fear for
you the torment of a Great Day!’” (Quran 7:59)
According to learned people both past and present, any
call to Islam that does not begin with
Tawheed
is doomed to failure.   Prophet
Muhammad instructed the
sahabah
to preach
Tawheed
when sending
them to various communities.  To those who went to Yemen he said, “You are
going to the People of the Book, so let the first thing that you invite them to
be the
Tawheed
of Allah”.
[1]
The title ‘People of the Book’ refers to the Jews and
the Christians, those given scriptures for guidance before the Quran was
revealed.   It is often easier to start a conversation about Islam with Christians
and Jews because they already believe in God.  Quran is filled with references,
and stories that can be easily related to and to which they already have their
own versions.  For instance mentioning the
surahs
of Quran that are
named after easily recognisable people such as
surah
19 – Maryam (Mary),
surah
14 - Ibrahim  (Abraham) or
surah
12 – Yusuf (Joseph).
Quran beseeches Prophet Muhammad to call the People of
the Book to Islam.  And Prophet Muhammad in his
Sunnah
made clear the
relationship between all of the prophets and messengers of Allah.
“Say O Muhammad ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and
Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship
none but God (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none
of us shall take others as lords besides God.’” (Quran 3:64)
“And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be
in (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say, ‘We
believe in that which has been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God
and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted’”.  (Quran 29:46)
“I am the nearest of all the people to the son of
Mary, and all the prophets are brothers and there is none between me and him (i.e. 
there is no other prophet between me and Jesus).”
[2]
“If a man believes in Jesus and then believes in me
he will get double reward.”
[3]
People who have no understanding of any of the three
monotheistic religions, such as Buddhists require different guidelines.  It is the
responsibility of the person giving
dawah
to have a basic understanding
of the beliefs of the non-believers they are calling to.  Buddhism for instance
is a way of life, but not in the same sense as Islam.  Put simply Buddhism, as
well as many eastern religions have a concept by which the person who does good
actions will eventually attain Godlike qualities.   On the other hand Hindus
believe in one Supreme God among many, and some of the more obscure religions
such as Zoroastrianism and Baha’i do include the concept of One Supreme God.  However,
you do not want to speak down to anyone as if you know more about their belief
system then they do themselves.  This is important whether that is the case or
not.  Remember, you do not want to offend anybody or inadvertently start an
argument.  More information about other religious beliefs can be found on our
other website
www.islamreligion.com
.
If a person has a strong belief in God or even a
nameless Supreme Being responsible for the creation, it is possible to teach
them that the God we call Allah is the same God that they call by other names
such as Elohim or Yahweh.  "

convey the message; we are not accountable if they do not convert. As mentioned
earlier it is Allah that provides the guidance and the desire to accept Islam.
Remember that whenever we intend to convey the message we must do so with
wisdom, eloquent speech and in the most gracious manner. Arguments and heated
discussions are not the best methods of
dawah.
One who has accepted Islam must convey the message to
those nearest and dearest to him. Once a person has tasted the sweetness of
faith it becomes impossible not to desire that for all family members and
friends. Calling family members must be a first priority but sometimes it can
be the hardest work of all. Sometimes when you are the first member of your
family to heed the message you plunge the other members of your family into a
state of shock; especially if they do not mix with any Muslims in their daily
lives.
Your family needs a little time to accept the reality.
Make sure you have a supply of easy to read small books or pamphlets. If you
live at home you could leave them lying around, if not keep a supply in your
bag or car. People often want to know this or that and sometimes you simply do
not know the answer to all those questions. You are often just learning
yourself so don’t be tempted to make up an answer. Perhaps you could look it up
together remembering to always emphasis the Oneness of Allah, the Creator of
all that exists.
Your family and close friends will be watching closely
and this is when your behaviour will play a big part. You have probably given
up a lot of big things such as alcohol, parties, free mixing with the opposite gender,
and pork and pork products.  However, you have also added lots of little things;
more kind acts, generosity, eagerness to be helpful, more gracious manners and
a desire to establish strong unbreakable family ties. Showing kindness and
observing high moral standards is possibly the best way to introduce someone to
Islam. Good manners and courteous behaviour is also a very good form of
dawah
.
You are a role model for what Islam is all about.
Prophet Muhammad’s behaviour attracted others to Islam.
His beloved wife Aisha called his character a living example of the Quran.
[1]
He was kind and courteous to everybody and even his enemies could not help but
praise his noble character. This is the behaviour we must endeavour to emulate
and the people that will benefit the most are our family and close friends. A
kind word, a smile, a gift, or help of any sort, will showcase the beauty of
Islam.
Be particularly careful not to despair when you see your
family or friends engaging in behaviour that you now consider misconduct. Do
not abandon them because of their ways. You can leave their company if they are
drinking alcohol or acting in a non-Islamic manner - abandon the place, or the
situation, not the person. Invite them to your house and to your events so they
can see that fun and happiness can be found without alcohol or distasteful
entertainment.
Conversations at your workplace are also a way to spread
the message of Islam. Handing out pamphlets probably isn’t going to win you any
friends or influence people but your mannerisms and ways of dealing with people
will. Remember however that your colleagues are likely to be as shocked as your
family. If you have recently converted to Islam don’t expect fanfare and
congratulations but do expect curiosity. Again don’t give unqualified answers
to things you are not sure about. The one thing you are sure about is the
Oneness of Allah and His right to be worshipped.
Never give up hope. You may not see the people you love
entering Islam and it can be a source of great disappointment. However it is
wise to remember that it is Allah that guides a person to the right path.  Your
role in that process might be as little as being a friendly face in an
otherwise bleak day. Hope is something that Muslims have in abundance, so make
small efforts and lots of
du’a
for the people you love and those around
you.
Spreading the message and calling people to the right
path is the work that was carried out by all of Allah’s messengers. Each one
called his own people to the One God, Allah.  Prophet Muhammad however was sent
to all of humankind; he gave the good news to the believers of immense reward
in the Hereafter, and warning the unbelievers against a severe punishment.
Prophet Muhammad expected all of those "

Definition of Sin & its Types
A sin is defined as an act of disobedience
in which a person leaves Allah’s command.  A sinner contradicts
Shariah
by opposing a command of Allah given in the Quran or
Sunnah
.  Scholars
describe a sin with the image of “stepping out” of divine obedience by doing
what is forbidden or leaving what is required.  Islam teaches that man is not
born in sin, rather he becomes sinful when he commits a sin.
Sins can be categorized into:
a)
Kufr
(disbelief): It takes a
person outside of the fold of Islam and makes him a disbeliever.  Examples of
this sin will be clarified below, but it should be clear that
kufr
will
take a person out of the fold of Islam when they are consciously aware of the
nature and severity of the sin they are doing.  In essence,
kufr
constitutes
completely “stepping out” of Islam and divine obedience.  A person who commits
kufr
is called a ‘disbeliever’ (Arabic:
kafir
) and he is no longer a Muslim. 
If he dies in that state, he will enter into Hell and stay there forever (9:84;
24:55).  It should be noted that calling someone a
kafir
(disbeliever)
is not to be done by the average individual; it is a ruling issued by Islamic scholars.
If a Muslim sees another committing an act of
kufr
they are to give that
person advice repetitively but the title ‘disbeliever’ should not be given to
him.
It is important to note
that despite stepping into disbelief, a person can re-enter Islam at any time
before
death.
b)
Major and minor sins
: The one who
commits major and minor sins does not lose all their faith and is within the
fold of Islam (49:6; 2:282).  Such a person is a Muslim, but with damaged faith
(Arabic: “
imaan
”).
The remaining lesson will explain disbelief.
Definition of Disbelief
“Disbelief” (Arabic:
kufr
) is defined as absence
of faith (Arabic:
imaan
) by all Muslim scholars.  It does not matter
whether the person speaks of it or holds it in the heart.
[1]
In other
words, ‘disbelief’ (Arabic:
kufr
) is any word, act, or belief that
contradicts faith (Arabic:
imaan
).
Examples of Disbelief
1.Committing
shirk
.
2.Hating or cursing God and the Quran.
3.Hating, cursing, abusing, or making fun of Prophet Muhammad even
if a person is convinced of his truthfulness.
4.Saying Prophet Muhammad lied.
5.Knowing the Prophet conveyed the truth, but rejecting to follow
his teachings.
6.Making fun of any teaching of Islam.
7.Prostrating to an idol.
8.Worshipping Prophet Muhammad the way Christians worship Jesus.
Who is a Disbeliever, a
Kafir
?
A disbeliever is a person who disbelieves in the message
of Prophet Muhammad. It is one who has not uttered the two testimonies, lacks
the correct Islamic faith (
imaan
), or holds a belief, says a word, or
does an act of disbelief.
There is an important point to be understood here.  If a
person who becomes a Muslim by uttering the Testimony of Faith (
shahadah
)
holds a belief, says, or does what is considered
kufr
, he may not necessarily
become a disbeliever.  The reason is that after becoming a Muslim, there are
certain obstacles that prevent a person from becoming a
kafir
.
Reasons That Prevent a Person from Becoming a Disbeliever
A Muslim might fall into disbelief, but not become a disbeliever
due to one of the following reasons:
[2]
1.Ignorance
A convert, a Muslim who grew up in a remote area, or a
Muslim who was raised in an irreligious environment may be ignorant of the
basic beliefs, religious duties, and prohibitions of Islam.  Such a person may
not know, for example, that Islam prohibits homosexuality or requires prayers
five times a day.  These people may fall into disbelief, but will not become disbelievers
because in the sight of Allah they may be excused due to their ignorance.
2.Mistake
A person may miss the mark and do something he never
intended.  He may simply make an unintentional, honest mistake.  For example,
if a convert to Islam believes that consuming alcohol is only forbidden at
prayer times. From a textual perspective, consuming alcohol, while believing it
to be lawful, is an act of disbelief, but this person would not become a
disbeliever because of the honest mistake h"

With respect to their severity,
sins are categorized into major and minor sins.  Major sins are called

(sing.
kabirah
) and are mentioned in Quran 4:131, 42:37, 53:32.  Minor
sins, or
saghair
(sing.
saghirah
) are mentioned in Quran 18:49.  All
deeds, including major and minor sins, are recorded and these records will be
given to the individual on the Day of Judgment (Quran 18:49, 54:2-3).
Definition of Major Sins
[1]
Any sin for which the Quran or
Sunnah
prescribes
a punishment in this world such as for murder, adultery, and theft; or about
which there is a threat of Allah’s anger and punishment in the Hereafter, as
well as anything whose perpetrator has been cursed by our Prophet.
Definition of a Minor Sin
A minor sin is every sin that does not have a prescribed
punishment for this life or a threat attached to it in the Hereafter.
Do Major Sins Make a Person a Disbeliever?
Sins damage faith by reducing it.  A Muslim’s faith
reduces in proportion to the amount of his sins.  Nevertheless, neither major,
nor minor sins eradicate faith completely.  A sin does not turn a Muslim into a
non-believer unless the person believes the sin to be permissible.  He might
deem a sin permissible either because he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge that
Allah has forbidden it or he doubts the prophethood of Muhammad, may the mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon him.  In either case, when a sin is tantamount
to denying the Quran and rejecting Prophet Muhammad the doer of that sin steps
into disbelief without even doing the sin.  For example, if a person insists
that Allah has allowed fornication, while they know it is forbidden in the
Quran, that person turns into an disbeliever. Otherwise, we do not consider
people to become non-Muslims on account of a sin they commit.
The proof that a person who commits a sin is considered
Muslim is found in the Quran and Prophetic Traditions:
1.The Quran says:
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up
with him in worship but He will forgive whoever He wishes for anything besides
that.” (Quran 4:48)
2.Whoever dies without committing
shirk
with Allah shall
enter Paradise.
[2]
3.A person who believes in
Tawheed
will enter Paradise even
if he fornicates and steals.
[3]
There was an alcoholic in the time of the Prophet.  One
time when he was punished, a Muslim cursed him.  The Prophet forbade that Muslim
from cursing that Companion and he said: ‘Do not curse him, for by Allah, he
loves Allah and His Messenger.’
[4]
Due to his belief in Allah and His Prophet, the major sin that he was doing did
not wipe out all his faith.
How Are Major Sins Forgiven?
Major sin can be forgiven by the following ways:
a)    Through sincere repentance, which entails
leaving the sin, having remorse for performing it, and resolving to never
perform it again.  If the sin involves wrongdoing towards others, then in
addition to the above, he must also restore their rights or property or seek
their forgiveness.
When Allah sees this
sincere repentance from one of His slaves – a slave who truly turns to his Lord
in fear and hope – He not only
forgives
the sin, but
replaces
those sins for good deeds to the slave’s credit.  This is from Allah’s infinite
grace and mercy.  Allah says this right after mentioning the sins of
shirk
,
murder, and adultery, He says: “Except those who repent and believe, and do
righteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and
Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Quran 25:70)  This blessing is only
for one who has faith, whose repentance is sincere, and who strives to work
righteous deeds.
b)   By Allah’s pure grace, generosity, and favor. 
Allah may therefore forgive whomsoever He wills without that individual having
actually repented.
c)    By the performance of certain acts, like
Hajj
,
according to some scholars.
Fate of a Person Who Dies Committing Major Sins
A person who dies from an unrepented major sin is at
Allah’s discretion in the Hereafter.  If Allah wants, He may punish him first acc"

The punishment for sin is lifted from a person by the
following:
1.  Repentance
Repentance
has
conditions which have been discussed earlier.  There is no repentance if those
conditions are not met.  Meeting the conditions of repentance guarantees
forgiveness.  Repentance guarantees forgiveness from major sins as well.  Allah
says:
“Say: ‘O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves
(by committing sins)! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, indeed, Allah forgives
all sins.  Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’” (Quran 39:53)
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and
forgives sins” (Quran 42:25)
2.  Praying for forgiveness
Asking for forgiveness is not tied to strict conditions
like repentance.  It is simply a prayer that Allah may or may not accept.  The
Prophet said:
“If a person commits a sin, then says, ‘O Lord, I have
committed a sin so forgive me,’ He says, ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who
may forgive sins or punish for it; I have forgiven My slave…’”
[1]
3.  Doing good deeds which wipe out sins
Allah says:
“Indeed, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.” (Quran 11:114)
·Daily Prayers and Friday Prayer
“Each of the five daily prayers and from one Friday
prayer to the next is an expiation for the time in between, so long as one does
not commit any major sin.”
[2]
·Ablution
“When a Muslim, or a believer, washes his face (in
the course of ablution), every sin which he committed with his eyes, will be
washed away from his face with water, or with the last drop of water; when he
washes his hands, every sin which is committed by his hands will be effaced
from his hands with the water, or with the last drop of water; and when he
washes his feet, every sin his feet committed will be washed away with the
water, or with the last drop of water; until he finally emerges cleansed of all
his sins.”
[3]
·Fasting
Ramadan
“Whoever fasts
Ramadan
out of faith and the
hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.”
[4]
“Whoever spends the night of
Laylat al-Qadr
in prayer out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be
forgiven.”
[5]
·
Hajj
“Whoever performs Pilgrimage to this House, and
does not engage in sexual relations with his wife during it and does not engage
in sinful behavior will go back free of sin like the day his mother gave birth
to him.”
[6]
Righteous deeds such as prayer, fasting,
Hajj
,
etc only expiate for transgressions against the rights of Allah.  With regard
to sins that have to do with the rights of other people, one has to repent from
them.
4.  Prayers of fellow believers such as the funeral prayer
The Messenger of Allah said:
“There is no Muslim man
who dies, and forty men pray the funeral prayer for him, not associating
anything with Allah, but Allah will accept their intercession for him.”
[7]
Angels also pray for the believer:
“Those who bear the Throne, and those who are around it,
glorify their Lord with His praise, and believe in Him.  They ask forgiveness
for those who believe, saying, Our Lord, You embrace all things in mercy and
knowledge.  Forgive those who turn to You and follow Your path.  Save them from
the punishment of Hell.” (Quran 40:7)
5.  Intercession of the Prophet on the Day of Resurrection
The Prophet said:
“My intercession will be for those among my
ummah
who committed major sins.”
[8]
And he said:
“I was given the choice between admitting half of
my
ummah
to Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession.”
[9]
6.  Allah wipes out sins by calamities of this world
The Prophet said:
“No tiredness, exhaustion, worry,
grief, distress or harm befalls a believer in this world, not even a thorn that
pricks him, but Allah expiates some of his sins thereby.”
[10]
7.  The torment, squeezing, and terror of the grave will also
expiate sins.
8.  Undergoing the horrors, distress and hardship of the Day
of Resurrection will expiate some sins.
9.  Mercy of the Most Merciful
By the mercy of Allah, with no cause on the part of
His slaves, many will be forgiven.
[11]
Unforgivable Sin
If a person dies as a
kafir
he will not be
forgiven. "
